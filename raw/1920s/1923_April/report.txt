The choir and congregation sang, "Guide us, O thou great Je- 
hovah." 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

It is indeed a source of pleasure to see such a magnificent audience 
here this morning at the opening of our General Conference. 

DEDICATION OF THE SALT LAKE TEMPLE THIRTY YEARS AGO 

I am reminded of the fact that thirty years ago today we were 
dedicating the Salt Lake Temple. I am reminded of the fact that of 
the twenty-six General Authorities of the Church who were then alive, 
Presidents Seymour B. Young, Brigham H. Roberts, J. Golden Kim- 
ball, Rulon S. Wells and I are the only ones now living, and that 
four chosen during the past thirty years, have also passed away from 
this life. 

TEMPLE CORNERSTONE LAID SEVENTY YEARS AGO 

My attention has also been called to the fact that seventy years 
ago today the corner-stones of the Salt Lake Temple were laid by the 
General Authorities, and that a contingent of the Nauvoo Legion was 
in attendance, under the direction of my father, as major-general, and 
marshal of the day. 

GREAT PROGRESS OF THE CHURCH 

I am grateful for the preservation of my life until the present 
moment, and I desire to live as long as I can be of any benefit to the 
Latter-day Saints. I am grateful for the very wonderful work that 
has been accomplished in the Salt Lake Temple, since its dedication. 
I am grateful for the prosperity, for the advancement spiritually, 
temporally, and in every other way, of the Church of Jesus Christ dur- 
ing this period. I am thankful for the great increase in the attendance 
at our General Conferences, in comparison with that of thirty years 
ago. It was very seldom that we had, then, more than two-thirds as many 
in the audience as we ,see here today, with the exception of Sundays, 
when, of course, we always had more people than this building could 
accommodate.

GENERAL STATISTICAL INFORMATION 

It has been customary at the April Conference to- give some sta- 
tistics regarding the expenditure of the tithes of the people, our mis- 
sion work, and other items ; and, as a rule, during the time that I have 
presided over the Church, I have read those statistics at the close of 
my remarks; but, today I have decided to read them first and trust 
to the inspiration of the Lord that the latter part of my remarks may 
perhaps be more interesting and more inspiring than statistics. 

Following are the expenditures from the tithes of the Church for 
the year 1922 : 

STAKE AND WARD PURPOSES: 

There has been returned from the tithes to the stakes and wards 

for their maintenance and operation $ 928,859.00 

EDUCATION: 

Expended for the maintenance and operation of Church schools. 771,490.00 
TEMPLES : 

Expended for the construction, maintenance and operation of 

temples 168,371.00 

CHARITIES : 

For the care of the worthy poor and other charitable purposes, 

including hospital treatment 273,657.00 

MISSIONS : 

For the maintenance and operation of all the missions, and for 

the erection of places of worship and other buildings in the 

missions 615,461.00 

TOTAL: $2,757,838.00 

which has been taken from the tithes and returned by the 
Trustee-in-Trust to the Saints for the maintenance and operation 
of the stakes and wards, for the maintenance and operation of 
Church schools and temples, for charities and for mission 
activities. 

OTHER CHARITIES: 

In addition to charities paid out of the tithes, (as above stated) 
there have also been disbursed the fast offerings and Relief So- 
ciety charities, amounting to $323,638.00, which, added to the 
$273,657.00 paid from the tithes, makes a total of Church charities$ 597,295.00 

MISSIONS. 

In addition to the large sum paid out of Church funds' for 
mission purposes, amounting to $615,460.00, we estimate that 
there has been sent to missionaries by their families and friends, 
the sum of $887,500.00. Estimating the value of the services of 
1,775 missionaries at $1,000.00 per year each, viz $1,775,000, 
makes a total expenditure for the missionary work of the Church 
for the year 1922 $3,277,960.00

CLEAN UP TOWNS AND VILLAGES 

It is expected there will be a great increase in the tourist travel 
through the state from this time on, particularly through the southern 
part of the state, where the government and the railroads are spending 
large sums of money to induce tourists to visit Zion National Park, 
Bryce Canyon, Cedar Breaks, and the Grand Canyon of the Colorado. 
In view of this, our people should take pride in cleaning up. and grad- 
ing their streets, fixing their fences, planting trees, and in every way 
making their towns and villages more attractive. 

TEMPLES AND MEETING HOUSES 

The Alberta Temple is practically completed. Its furnishing and 
equipment is in process. It will be ready for dedication by August 1, 
1923. 

The building of the Arizona Temple is under way. It is expected 
that it will be completed within two years. 

Extensive alterations and improvements will be carried out this 
year in the Salt Lake Temple, to provide facilities for the large num- 
ber who> visit the temple. Comparative report of total ordinances per- 
formed in the Salt Lake Temple: 1918, 158,887; 1919, 189,593; 1920, 
212,514; 1921, 300,474; 1922, 413,478, an increase of nearly three hun- 
dred per cent since 1918, — a most remarkable and wonderful record. 
And our other temples, with the exception of St. George, where the 
population has decreased, have also- had remarkable and splendid in- 
creases. 

A splendid new meetinghouse has been erected in Honolulu and 
will be dedicated in the very near future. 

A mission home is in process of erection in Atlanta, Georgia, for 
the accommodation of the president and office staff of the Southern 
States mission, the only mission of the United States that has not 
been furnished with suitable quarters for its president. Quite a number 
of chapels, some large and beautiful, are being erected in most of the 
missions of the United States. 

THE PRIMARY CONVALESCENT HOME 

The Primary Home is taking care of from twenty-five to thirty 
children, who need expert surgical and nursing treatment. The Church 
has expended considerable means in preparing and equipping this home 
for these little children. Since then it has been very largely supported 
by the gifts of the Primary children and other benevolent persons, The 
Rotary Club of Salt Lake City has just donated $1,000 to this chil- 
dern's home. 

TRAINING OF THE AARONIC PRIESTHOOD 

A commendable work is being done in all the wards and stakes 
in the development and training of the Aaronic Priesthood and this 
good work should be continued.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



TITHES RETURNED TO THE STAKES 

I should like to call attention to the fact that the amount of 
tithes returned to the stakes, and the total amount of charity, including 
that of the relief society and the Fast day donations, amounts to over 
$3,300,000. Considering the limited membership of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, to my mind this is a marvelous 
and wonderful showing of the liberality of the people, and of their 
willingness to contribute for the support and erection of meetinghouses, 
the support and erection of schoolhuses, and for educational, charitable 
and church purposes generally. 

REMARKABLE INCREASE IN TEMPLE WORK 

I am particularly pleased with the very remarkable increase in 
the labor being performed in our temples. There is no work in which 
the Latter-day Saints are engaged which brings greater peace and joy 
to the human heart than laboring in the temples for the salvation of our 
dead. This vicarious labor is one of the greatest that Latter-day 
Saints can be engaged in. It is one that brings greater satisfaction and 
joy than almost any other in the world, and it is one in which the 
Latter-day Saints have always taken great pride and great interest. I 
believe there is no money expended by the Church or by the individual 
members that has brought more comfort and happiness to the people 
than that expended for the erection of temples and for the labor per- 
formed therein. 

I am pleased to hear that the temple erected in the Hawaiian Islands 
is doing a great deal by way of advertising the Latter-day Saints and 
causing a great many influential people, — tourists visiting those won- 
derful islands, — to take an interest in the literature of the Latter-day 
Saints. I hear nothing but good reports from that temple ; and I also 
hear very wonderful and splendid reports concernnig the spirit of 
good-will that comes through such visits to the temple that is not yet 
dedicated in Canada. I believe Brother Wood, the president of the 
Alberta stake, might be willing to put off the dedication another year, 
on account of the great good that he thinks would be accomplished 
iSy admitting strangers into our temple before it is dedicated. But, 
we have erected that temple, of course, for temple ordinances, and when 
it is ready for dedication, we will dedicate it that it may be utilized for 
the purposes expected of us by the Lord. 

THE' BEET INDUSTRY AND THE CHURCH 

A year ago, in this stand, at the opening of the Conference, I de- 
voted neraly the entire time in my address, to the beet industry. I 
urged upon our people, during that conference, the planting of sugar 
beets, and announced that I believed it would be greatly to their ad- 
vantage if they would do so. This was my opinion then. I am 
pleased to say that during the past year the industry has been very 
successful, and that today it is in a very much better financial condi- 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT

tion than it was a year ago. Two years ago this coming October the 
Church went in debt for the first time in many years; the 
Trustee-in-Trust borrowed in New York and Chicago in the neigh- 
borhood of two millions of dollars, to help the sugar industry. It went 
against the grain, to run the Church in debt, but it was the unanimous 
opinion of the Presidency and Apostles that it was a wise thing to 
foster this industry, by borrowing the money necessary to protect and 
safeguard it. I am very pleased to announce to the Latter-day Saints 
that all of those obligations of the Trustee-in-Trust, incurred for 
the support of the sugar industry, have been paid, and once more the 
Church has no direct floating indebtedness, barring one little note of 
$10,000, that we did not get a chance to take up. 

PEOPLE ADVISED TO STAY ON THE FARM 

I believe it will be to the interests of the farmers to raise sugar 
beets during the coming year. I believe that the sugar industry, 
in our community, is one of the greatest beneficial industries that has 
ever been established. I feel that President Wilford Woodruff was 
inspired of the Lord to call upon the people to invest their means in that 
great enterprise; although some of the brightest of our business 
men had no faith in the final outcome. President Woodruff felt 
that the inspiration of the Lord pointed to the establishment of that 
industry, so as to have an increase of the products of the soil. It has 
always fallen to the lot of the Latter-day Saints to be engaged in tilling 
the soil. From the days of President Brigham Young until the 
present time, the leaders of this people have always advised the Lat- 
ter-day Saints, as far as possible, to be engaged in tilling the soil, 
and in manufacturing, and in other productive enterprises. Erigham 
Young preached that the Saints perhaps could go to California and 
get sudden wealth and come back with gold, but said it would do them 
very little good, while if they stayed on their farms and engaged in 
cultivating the soil, making homes and in rearing ther famlies, they 
would gain eternal riches. I believe firmly that the very best place in 
all the world to rear Latter-day Saints is on the farm, and that about 
the poorest place to rear Latter-day Saints is in the biggest city in 
which you can locate them. There seems to be strength, physical, moral 
and religious, which comes to those engaged in cultivating the soil 
which, on an average, is far superior to that of any other occupation I 
know anything about. 

At the present time there is quite a feeling that it is not worth 
while to stay on the farm, that the thing to do is to sell the farm, or 
if it is mortgaged for a large amount, to say: "Well, we will let 
the man who owns the mortgage cultivate it. It does not pay us to 
cultivate it." This is wrong. I believe that with the blessings of 
the Lord and with economy and the raising of products from the 
ground, and utilizing those products to feed cattle, sheep and hogs, 
and to increase your income by producing butter, egges, cheese and in 



8 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



other ways, that the farms can be made profitably productive. I re- 
member that when I was in the far-off land of Japan, I ate butter from 
Scandinavia, and I know that while I was in England the great 
majority of the time I ate butter from Scandinavia. If butter can be 
shipped all the way from Scandinavia to Japan, I believe that butter 
can be raised and shipped at a profit out of this inter-mountain coun- 
try. There are no finer farms to be found anywhere than can be 
found in this inter-mountain country. It is the best dairy country. 
There is no stronger, more substantial and splendid soil that will pro- 
duce year after year if it is only treated right, than that of this inter- 
mountain country. 

THRIFT, ECONOMY AND HARD TIMES 

We talk about hard times. I wish to say that I have read more 
than once the wise sayings of Benjamin Franklin, on thrift and econ- 
omy, and his reference to the people's complaint against the tax burdens 
laid upon them. He says that the luxuries in which the people indulge 
and the wasteful expenditure of their money is a far greater burden, 
many times over, than the taxes and the public burdens the people have 
to meet. Today, the great majority of all the money put into auto- 
mobiles is for pleasure. In the state of Utah we have about 50,000 
automobiles. I think we have a few more than that. 1 do not be- 
lieve the depreciation, wear and tear, the oil, gasoline, and the tires, 
will cost less than $50.00 a month per car on an average; 50,000 cars 
at fifty dollars each a month is $2,500,000; multiplied by twelve, is 
$30,000,000 a year, principally an unnecessary expense. I believe that 
this figure could be cut squarely in two, if the people made up their 
minds to do it. I believe that nearly all of the hardships of a majority 
of the people would disappear if the}' were willing to forego the habit 
of wearing silk stockings, so to speak, and get back to the ordinary 
manner of dressing in a rather quiet, unassuming way; stay away 
from about nine-tenths of the picture shows that they attend ; return 
to the ways of thrift and economy that I have heard preached from 
this stand from the days of President Brigham Young until today. 

I believe that the burdens that are upon the Latter-day Saints would 
be very light indeed had the people listened to the advice of our late 
beloved President Joseph F. Smith, to get out of debt, whai everything 
was booming, when they could sell all of their sheep' and their cat- 
tle and nearly everything they had for about two or three times its 
cost instead of running, as they did, further in debt, increasing their 
mortgages on homes and live-stock, believing that every dollar they 
could borrow meant increased wealth to them. President Joseph F. 
Smith's warning sank into my heart. If I have had one opportunity, 
being in debt, to go in deeper, I have had scores offered to me, but 
I remembered the teaching of President Smith and I went to work 
that day to get out of debt and not to speculate one single solitary 
dollar until I did get out of debt; and, with the exception of some 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT

small loans on my life insurance policies, — I have saved by investing 
in a building society every month enough to pay these loans — I do 
not today personally owe a dollar. If I had not listened to and taken 
the inspired advice of Pres. Smith, I think I should be everlastingly 
"busted," because of the very many good things that have been of- 
fered to me since for financial investments. Pres. Smith's inspired words 
found echo in my heart, and I went on from then until his death, 
singing, "We thank Thee, O God, for a prophet to guide us," instead 
of adding, "providing he does not guide us to keep out of debt," as a 
good many people should be singing today. 

AN APPEAL TO SUPPORT HOME INDUSTRY 

Brethren and sisters, support our home manufactured goods of 
all kinds and all descriptions. At a recent conference, I pleaded with 
the people to do this, and told story after story about home-made 
goods, and announced that I was going to have a Provo suit o<f clothes. 
I got that suit and have been wearing it every since, but it is a little old 
now, and so I thought I would put on my black suit again this morning. 
Let us support our home industries. Let us stay on the farm. Let us 
remember that our fathers sacrificed and came here for the gospel 
of the Lord Jesus Christ. 

I want again to assure you that the best place in the world to 
rear Latter-day Saints is on the soil. I know of people who have 
sold their farms, gone to California or some other place to work, and 
spent all their farms brought them. Now they are wishing they had 
enough to get back to Utah. 

"O say what is Truth? 'Tis the fairest gem 
That the riches of worlds can produce ; 

And priceless the value of truth will be, when 

The proud monarch's costilest diadem 
Is counted but dross and refuse." 

We have the Truth to give to the world. We have the plan of 
life and salvation. We have the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, and 
if we will live our religion, the Lord God Almighty will bless us. 

"Yes, say, what is truth? 'Tis the brightest prize 
To which mortals or Gods can aspire; 

Go search in the depths where it glittering lies, 

Or ascend in pursuit to the loftiest skies ; 
'Tis an aim for the noblest desire." 

Every Latter-day Saint should have a desire, above all other things, 
that his life should proclaim the Truth, and that his life should 
be a teacher of the Truth, not only to the world, but especially to his 
own family. 

"The sceptre may fall from the despot's grasp, 
When with winds of stern justice he copes, 
But the pillar of truth will endure to the last, 
And its firm-rooted bulwarks outstand the rude blast 
And the wreck of the fell tyrant's hopes.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Then, say what is truth? Tis the last and the first, 

For the limits of time it steps o'er ; 
Though the heavens depart, and the earth's fountains burst, 
Truth, the sum of existence, will weather the worst, 

Eternal, unchanged, evermore. 

I pray the Lord to bless us abundantly in this conference. We 
are going to have more speakers than ever before, for we are going to 
limit the time of the speakers including myself. I usually talk an 
hour in my opening address ; I decided to take thirty minutes this 
morning and I have just about a minute left. 

We are going to depart a little from our usual custom, and call 
on the presidents of stakes and others to make brief addresses, not ex- 
ceeding ten minutes. I earnestly pray the blessings of the Lord to 
attend you. Amen.

the love and blessings of the Presidency, and I am sure with deep 
satisfaction on their own parts for the privilege that they have had of

laboring in spreading the gospel. I am sure that the Lord has abund- 
antly blessed them and rewarded them, with a rich outpouring of his 
spirit for their splendid labors. 

ELDER ABEL J. EVANS 

{Second Counselor in the Presidency of the Alpine Stake of Zion) 

My brethern and sisters : I have had many experiences of various 
kinds, in my life, but I think nothing to equal this. I certainly desire 
that the few moments I shall occupy, I may do it under the inspiration 
of our heavenly Father. I am sure President Chipman would have been 
delighted to be here to occupy a short time this morning, and I should 
have been proud to listen to him. We have worked together for over 
twenty-two years — President Clark, President Chipman and myself — 
and we have not yet had our first disagreement in opinions, although 
we do not always agree in the beginning as to just certain methods, but 
it is all in brotherly love and kindness and for the welfare and interest 
of the Latter-day Saints over whom we are called to preside. 

I rejoice this morning in the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, after 
having spent now seventy years of my life, having been born in the 
Church and having gone through the various vicissitudes through which 
the Church has been called upon to pass, during that time. My testimony 
today is as bright, and my assurance as great as ever and my determina- 
tion perhaps stronger than ever before, and my desire is to remain 
faithful to this great Latter-day work. I have had the honor, upon two 
occasions, to go out into the world to lift my voice in calling the children 
of men to repentance, and I have rejoiced exceedingly in that labor, 
and I have continued work at home in a small degree in this great 
Latter-day cause. 

I could not help but reflect when President Grant made the remark 
that only President Seymour B. Young and himself and two or three 
others are still alive of the General Authorities who were present when 
the Temple was dedicated. I remember that occasion very well. Oh, my 
heart rejoiced! I think that if ever words sank into my soul as deeply 
as they did upon that occasion I do not remember it. The Prophet of 
God told the people assembled that if they had made their wrongs 
right ; if they had come to that dedication with clean hands and with 
pure hearts, having adjusted their difficulties and their troubles with the 
people with whom they associated, the Lord God Almighty would 
forgive their sins. I rejoiced exceedingly in that declaration and promise 
and have sought from that day to this to keep in line. I have known per- 
sonally every President of the Church since the Prophet Joseph Smith, 
and I have loved each of them with all my heart, and President Grant 
no less than his predecessors. His counselors are men of God, standing 
for the right, seeking to promulgate the interest of this great Church 
that God has instituted in the day and generation in which we live, un-

selfishly devoting their time and their talent to the interest and the 
advancement of this great Latter-day work, ever looking into the details 
that are necessary to accomplish the greatest purposes. They have 
been exceedingly liberal in extending help to the various stakes of Zion 
in the erection of their meetinghouses and amusement halls, and bless- 
ing the missionaries by bringing them home from their fields of labor. 
I have rejoiced in this, and I have felt in my heart that if we Latter- 
day Saints would stand as faithfully by them, as they have stood by 
us, the Church would advance by leaps and bounds, because more means 
would come into their hands from the honest tithes of the Latter-day 
Sains, thereby giving them the opportunity "to do more than they have 
been able to do heretofore, because we have closed our hearts, in many 
instances against the principle of tithing which the Lord has instituted 
for carrying on his work in the Church. 

May the Lord bless us, my brethren and sisters ; may we appre- 
ciate our condition, and be thankful that the Lord God of heaven has 
given us a testimony of this great and divine work, and that the Book 
of Mormon came through the power and gift of God in its delivery 
and in, its translation by the Prophet Joseph Smith. I rejoice in this 
with all my heart, and I desire that the Lord will continue to preserve 
me in the truth until I shall have finished my work in this world ; and 
I have an assurance, an abiding faith that I will meet my. father and 
my mother. My father gave his life in this cause, having laid it 
down in the mission field, and I feel that he will wear a martyr's 
crown. I have it in my heart to pray that I may conduct myself in 
such a way that I may meet him, with some degree of satisfaction 
upon his part. May the Lord bless us, my brethren and my sisters, from 
President Grant down to the last and least in the Church, is my 
prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER WINSLOW FARR SMITH 

{Former President of the Northern States Mission) 

Last Sunday throughout the world was celebrated the Easter 
day. A prominent divine of our city, in his service, laid emphasis, I 
am told, on the fact that the Lord Jesus Christ and the prophets of 
old were mere human beings, as we are, possessed of no further aid 
than human aid in performing their work. In short that Christ was 
man — not God. As I heard this report, there came to my mind the 
words of Peter to the Savior, when he said to him: "Whom say ye 
that I am?" And Peter replied: "Thou art the Christ the Son of the 
Living God.'' It occurred to me that among the Latter-day Saints, as 
among no other people in the world, positive knowledge exists. While 
we are few in number, we are powerful and mighty in influence for 
good, because in the heart of every one of the members in the Church 
who is doing his duty, there is that positive knowledge that God 



ELDER WIN SLOW FARR SMITH

lives, that Jesus is the Christ, and that in this day and age man was 
chosen for a great work, and unto him was given the Priesthood of 
God. Through the work of this priesthood, and because of its influ- 
ence, every man and every woman, yea, every boy and every girl in the 
Church, who is doing his part, should the question be put to him : 
"Whom say ye that Jesus Christ is?" can answer, "He is the Christ, 
the Son of the Living God." I rejoice in the blessing that has been 
mine to labor in the mission field, to become intimately and closely as- 
sociated with between four hundred and five hundred young men and 
young women of Zion, boys and girls in many instances, who have 
accepted the call and gone into the field and done the best they could 
to carry on the great work that is entrusted to us as a people. I have 
marveled at their wonderful growth. In many instances they have 
come into the field ignorant of the ways of the world, ignorant of 
the basic principles of the gospel, unschooled in the learning of the 
world ; yet possessing a faith, and a determination that they would put 
the best they had into that which they were called to do. This faith 
has spurred them on, and through application, through diligence, 
through humility, through prayer, they have come to know beyond the 
shadow of a doubt that the gospel is true. 

I am reminded that on one occasion a young man who had been 
in the field a number of months s'ood before the group of mission- 
aries in one of our little council mee'ings and said: "Would that I 
could say as you brethren have said, that I know that the gospel is true. 
I believe it is true, I accept it, and I am glad to be here doing what 
I can for its furtherance, I have the means and I want the privilege 
of staying in the field and working until I can say, as these brethren 
have said, that I know the gospel is true. Not many months after 
that, in one of our council meetings, this same young man stood up 
and bore a most fervent testimony. He declared that he knew that 
it was true, and there was real, genuine, sincere conviction in the ring 
of his voice, and he proved with his works, his diligent application, 
with his untiring efforts to do all that was asked of him, that it was 
true ; and when the time came for his release he said to me : "Would 
to God that I oould spend my life in the wonderful influence of this 
mission." 

Brothers and s'sters, we can all have that spirit if we will ; we 
can all know beyond the shadow of a doubt, if we will. There is a 
positive rule, laid down by the Lord Jesus Christ, recorded by John, 
couched in these words : "If any man will do his will, he shall know 
the doctrine, whether it be of God or whether I speak of myself." 
If we will do his will, this promise of the Lord unto us will be kept ; 
and in this age of skepticism, when doubt fills the earth, when men 
in high positions, many of them professed teachers of religion, express 
doubt as to the divinity of the Lord Jesus Christ, this people, under 
the guidance of the Priesthood of Alrmghty God, will be immune 
to such influences, yea, they will be a testimony to the world that 



14 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



they know that God lives. I am grateful that we live in this day. I 
thank God for the vicissitudes that have come to this people, for 
through them has been born faith, sterling faith, genuine faith in 
God and his promises ; and if we remain true, our testimonies will 
grow. We will be loyal to our bishops, loyal to our stake officers, 
and we will recognize our president and his associates> the men at the 
head of this Church, as men of God. Their counsel and their advice 
we will heed. I pray that we may have the strength to do this, and 
that we do all we can to support our boys and our girls in the mission 
fields. They know the troubles at home; they know the perils through 
which we are passing as a people; but they need our encouragement. 
Let the discouragements in the home and the hardships be kept from 
them, Send them happiness and encouragement to the utmost, that they 
may have the fire of the spirit of the gospel in their hearts, and that 
the testimonies that are growing and being built up in their lives may be 
strengthened. I thank God for the boys and girls, and for our mis- 
sionary system. May we, to a man, be back of it, giving them the 
best that we have, doing the will of the Father, keeping his command- 
ments, and then we can say undoubtingly, unflinchingly, unhesitatingly, 
when the question comes to us, that we know that God lives, that 
Jesus is the Christ, the Redeemer of the world, and that Joseph Smith 
was indeed his Prophet, raised up for this great work, and that the 
Priesthood of God conferred upon him has come down through a 
noble succession of leaders and today the man who stands at our head 
is there because God wants him there, and he is deserving of our 
support. May the Lord give us this strength, this faith, and this 
testimony, is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER ROY A. WELKER 

(Second Counselor in the Presidency of the Bear Lake Stake of Zion) 

I. think, my brethren and sisters, that this is one of the most 
wonderful institutions in all the world. I have been impressed, ever 
since I was a boy, with the fact that the majority of the people of the 
world have been followers of leaders. I have been impressed, as a 
young student, with the life and influence of the great Confucius, 
Socrates, Plato and many of the modern wonderful scholars. I always 
had a longing desire to understand their marvelous principles and 
methods and systems of thought. I wanted to be on the inside, so to 
speak, of all that they knew, and all that they did, and strove to 
find out their ways. Quite early in life a call to a mission came 
to me. I saw an opportunity in that to gain experience. I struggled 
for a testimony. It came; and then the dream that I had of a stu- 
dent's life was very much upset. 1 was impressed with the character 
of Joseph Smith, of Rrigham Young, and of the other presidents and 
leaders of this Church. But I immediately noticed a wonderful dif- 



ELDER ROY A. WELKER 



15 



ference between them and the so-called scholars of the world. It 
soon dawned upon me that there was a vast difference between them 
and the other men of the world. The first class had been led and di- 
rected, apparently, by their own powers. They had taken credit unto 
themselves for that which they had unfolded for their followers. I 
noticed in the life of President Joseph Smith, our Prophet, God's in- 
spired servant in the world, a disposition not to take credit unto him- 
self, but to give credit to that God with whom he said he had con- 
versed — not that indescribable God that so much puzzles the world 
today. So I began to give my allegiance to him as a leader, and to try 
to follow the teachings that he had given to the world through rev- 
elation from God. My testimony soon grew, and was strengthened, 
and I learned that we, in this world, my brethren and sisters, are 
children, not of the men of the earth, but that we are children of God. 
All that I have, all that I ever hope to be, I trust will be given as 
service to this great cause of the Latter-day work which I know is the 
work of God, not that invisible, incomprehensible God, such as is 
taught in the world, but he who was revealed to Joseph Smith in 
person, who has been revealed to many of our leaders, and whom we 
know by testimony, as we have known, if our hearts have been at- 
tuned to it. 

It was my good privilege while upon my mission to Germany to 
have President Grant visit us, and also my pleasurable task to trans- 
late some of his sermons into the German language. I know with 
what power and authority he spoke, and how the people were con- 
vinced that he was indeed a servant of the living God, and my testimony 
was wonderfully strengthened upon those occasions. I came to know, 
not by reason, not by logic, not by the philosophies of man, that 
President Grant was a servant of God, but by that spirit and that 
testimony which surpasses all that method of arrival at knowledge. 
I am happy to be numbered with the Saints of God, to claimi as such 
men President Grant and his counselors, the quorum of the Twelve 
Apostles and all the others constituted authorities of the Church as 
our right leaders, inspired and appointed by God in those wonder- 
ful positions. 

May the work of our Father progress, may we be inspired with 
the thought and the knowledge constantly that amongst the Latter- 
day Saints is the power of God, the only authority to speak in the 
name of God in the earth. The Priesthood of the Almighty is here 
in our midst, although others may claim it; yet they cannot be true, 
for the Lord said, when he visited Joesph Smith : "They are 
all wrong." We have no quarrel with our brethren of the world, but 
we do differ with (them in their 'opinons as to authority. They 
can never come to a proper knowledge of God except through the 
channels of the Priesthood or the authority of his servants whom he 
has appointed. 

May the Spirit of the Lord be upon this conference during its 



16 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



various sessions. May those who preside have a rich outpouring of 
God's Spirit with them. May we all know, even those who perhaps 
are not of our faith, down deep in their hearts, that the prophets of 
God live, and that they are here in our midst. May our testimonies 
grow and increase. May we follow the instructions that are given, 
for in them is safety. May we through our faithful lives, in the end, 
be saved in God's kingdom, I pray, in the name of Jesus. Amen. 



ELDER PETER M. HANSON 

(President of the Bear River Stake of Zion) 

My prethren and sisters: It is with a spirit of humility that I 
stand before you here this morning, in the opening session of our 
general conference. I feel very grateful, my brethren and sisters, for 
the opportunity I have of being a member in the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints. I am fully in harmony with the remarks of our 
President this morning. I have witnessed the humiliation of some of 
our brethren who are not able to meet their obligations, that they have 
contracted, while wq had "flush" times. I am sure, my brethren and 
sisters, if we had heeded- as our President said this morning, the coun- 
sel that we received from the Prophet Joseph 1 F. Smith, here, a num- 
ber of years ago, and which has been spoken in our conferences from 
time to time, that we would have been much better off financially as 
a people. I have tried, my brethren and sisters, to obey this counsel, 
and today I do not owe a man a dollar, and I am mighty thankful for 
this. 

I am reminded now that I left my native land fifty-two years ago, 
as a boy then sixteen years of age. I did not have a dollar. I in- 
terceded with an uncle of mine who paid my immigration to this 
land, and when T landed in Ogden I was one hundred and ten 
dollars in debt. It took me two years to liquidate that debt — two years 
of hard labor, after I came here. But that was the first thing I did 
after I arrived here in Utah. My relatives in the old country rather 
spurned me when I joined this unpopular Church. They thought, of 
course, that I did wrong. But when I think of it, my brethren and 
sisters, and of the blessings I have enjoyed since I came to this land, 
arriving here as I did with not a penny ; and today, though I have 
many wealthy relatives in the old country, today perhaps I could 
buy out some of them. That is the condition ; that is a part of the 
blessings, my brethren and sisters, that have come to me through 
obedience to the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. I feel this morning, 
as the brethren have said, to give my time and my talents, and all that 
I have to this great cause for I owe it all to the gospel of the Lord 
Jesus Christ. I pray, my brethren and sisters, that the Lord will inspire 
us, that we may do right, keep his commandments, live according to 



ELDER PETER M. HANSON

the light that we have received, and be in harmony with his servants 
who preside over us. I feel that we are greatly blessed when the 
general authorities come into our stake of Zion. We have been favored 
always in this respect at our quarterly conferences, with a visit from the 
general authorities of the Church, which we appreciate, brethren and 
sisters. I feel that I am in harmony with the servants of the Lord, 
who preside over us, and I pray that the Lord may bless us, that we 
may labor in love and in harmony and enjoy the blessings that we 
receive through the gospel, which is my prayer, and I ask it in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH F. McGREGOR 

{President of the Beaver Stake of Zion) 

I am reminded of a story of an Irishman who went into a drug- 
store to get some medicine. He asked the price. The druggist told 
him that it was so much for the medicine, and so much for the bottle 
and the label. He hesitated : "Well," he said, "hurry up and put a price 
on the cork, and let us know the worst." I am very thankful that 
Beaver comes toward the beginning of the alphabet so that the worst 
will soon be over. 

I was grateful, in listening to the remarks of President Grant this 
morning, that I was a Latter-day Saint, that my spirit had been held 
in reserve until this latter day, when I had been permitted to come 
upon the earth, when the gospel has been restored, and to think that 
I am affiliated with a people who enjoy so many bessings. We have 
been told that the death rate among the Latter-day Saints is eight 
and three-tenths per thousand. I believe that the death rate in the 
United States is nearly double that. As T recall, it was nearly double 
that last year; and educated people are sitting up and taking notice. 
They think there must be some cause for this condition. We have 
a very high birth rate. I did not quiet understand this morning 
whether it was thirty-six per thousand ; I believe that is what it was. 
How much higher it is than the average in the United States. I think 
it was twenty-two or twenty-three last year. Our birth rate is far 
ahead of that of the rest of the United States, and our death rate is far 
below. We know why this is. Through obedience to the law and 
ordinances of the gospel, the Lord is blessing his people, and he will 
continue to bless us. The way of the transgressor is hard, but we 
always receive blessings both in this life and in the life to come, by 
obedience to the laws and ordinances that He has laid down for the 
governing of his children. 

I was thinking this morning how this country had been changed 
since the advent of the Latter-day Saints, and I was thankful in my 
heart that, when the Pioneers were met at Green River by Samuel 
Brannan and he tried to get them to go on to California, they 



18 



GENERAL CONEERENCE 



refused to go, that they settled in this forsaken country. It was a 
forsaken country, and forbidding at that time; but the Lord knew 
what he was doing, and his servants were susceptible to the promptings 
and influence of his Spirit, and they knew what to do. President 
Brigham Young told them, when they were anxious to go to California, 
that if they would remain here, the Lord would temper the climate, 
and he has done so. One of our elderly brothers, Brother White of 
Beaver, was telling me yesterday, as we were riding up, about the con- 
ditions that obtained in that town in the early days. In the first place, 
they thought it was so cold that they could only dairy a little, but Pres- 
ident Young told them that if they would plant the hardier grains, 
wheat, oats, and grains of that kind, these would grow. They 
did .so. They made a dam in the Beaver river and turned all the water 
upon thirty acres ; but they continued, and now they are watering with 
(he Beaver river and its tributaries thirty-nine thousand acres, and 
they could water a great deal more if it were economically used. They 
are now raising plenty of fruit, apples, pears and fruits of that kind, 
and we have been told just recently by Mr. Peet, a man working for 
the railroad company, that it is the best place in the world, that he 
knows of, to raise celery. We are expecting to get some Hollanders 
in to show us how, this spring. We hope lo raise other things besides 
those that we are raising at the present time. 

I know that the Lord has blessed his people here in the valleys of 
the mountains, and what is said of Beaver could be said, practically, 
of most all the towns in our fair state. The Lord is overruling affairs 
for our good, as he has done from the beginning. I have often when 
a small boy, heard it stated that ship captains wanted our people on 
board. It was a well-known fact that the vessels did not go down 
when "Mormon" immigrants were on board, and they were out bidding 
for those immigrants to go in their vessels. I recall hearing Brother 
Brimhall tell a story, during the world war, as I remember it, that a 
ship had been torpedoed. They were getting the women and the 
children off on the life boats. Four "Mormon" boys stood by the 
railing looking over, and the captain came up to them and told them, 
"You go on this boat, and you on the other." And he assigned the 
four boys to as many different life boats. Someone spoke up to the 
captain and said: "Don't you know that these boys are 'Mormons'?" 
"Yes," he said: "I know it, and that is the reason 1 am assigning them 
to those life boats, because 'Mormons' don't sink." Brother Brimhall 
said he did no! want to tell that story until he knew absolutely that it 
was true. He wrote and got the information, and then he felt free 
in telling it. 

I know that the Lord watches over his people. I recall hearing 
my father tell when he was returning from a mission to Europe that 
a number of our elders were on their way home. They were very anx- 
ious, as the elders usually are, to get home, but when they came to Cedar 
Rapids, Iowa, they went to get their lunch baskets replenished. You 



ELDER JOSEPH F. McGREGOR 



19 



know "Mormon" elders do not patronize the diner, as a rule, because 
they haven't money enough. When they returned to the depot the train 
was just pulling out, and they missed it. They were very much 
disappointed, so anxious were they to get home, and they had missed 
their train. But there was nothing for them to do but to wait for 
the next train, wlrch they did. As they came along a few miles 
out there was depression and a swale, and the train that they had been 
traveling on, and on which they should have continued, had collided, 
head on with another train, and the cars were piled up thirty feet 
high on either s ; de of the track. It was no accident that they missed the 
train. The Lord had an overruling providence. 

So many instances could be told. I am reminded now of the con- 
ditions that obtained in Galveston when our elders were there at that 
great catastrophe, the sea heaving itself beyond its bounds, sweeping 
over the city, destroying so many hundreds of people there, and so much 
property. Our elders were housed in a small two-story frame building 
that was left intact in that part of the city — a wonderful manifesation 
of the overruling providence of. our heavenly Father ; and in the 
California disaster, in San Francisco, not one of them was hurt. We 
have been told that few have been injured in traveling to and from 
missions, and no vessels have gone down carrying brethren bound 
for Zion. We know how in the Zion's camp movement, when they 
were going up there, they were so anxious to reach Clay county, and 
President Woodruff has told us in his journal that they had so many 
difficulties to contend with. Wagon wheels ran off, wagon tongues 
were broken, and there was this, that and the other to delay them, 
so that they were compelled to pitch their tents between Big and 
Little fishing rivers. Soon after they had made their camp, five men 
rode in and told them that they would see hell before morning, and 
just then a little cloud began to unroll. It looked about as big, Brother 
Woodruff said, as a man's hand : it began to unroll, and in a few 
minutes the whole sky was inky black. A terrible storm came up. As 
the Prophet came into the schoolhouse, where they were for shelter, 
and shook the rain from his hat and coat, he said : "God is in this 
storm," and the enemy told them, afterwards, that in forty minutes 
Little Fishing River rose forty feet. You will all remember how the 
efforts of the enemy were thwarted. There were those in Ray and in 
Clay countes and in Jackson county who were uniting together to 
exterminate this little band of "Mormons," but the Lord intervened, 
and their plans were not permitted to mature. The next day Colonel 
Sconce, with some of his associates, came into the camp and he wanted 
to see and talk with the people, a people whom God had defended and 
whose battles he had fought. After talking with the Prophet and 
listening to a history of the people and their sufferings, tears came into 
their eyes, and they promised to go back and do all that they could in 
order to allay the prejudice which existed against the "Mormon" people, 
which, be it said to their credit, they did. 



20 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



I believe my ten minutes are up. I pray the Lord to bless us, my 
brethren and sisters, with his Spirit, that we may be fed the bread of life, 
in this conference, and go forth better prepared to perform our duties 
in this Church, is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JAMES W. FUNK 

[President of the Benson Stake of Zion) 

My brethren and sisters, it is because I have made it a rule and 
practice of my life to respond to the calls that have been made of me 
that I stand before yon this morning, for I assure you that I feel 
very weak and incapable, in a measure, of filling this position ex- 
cept that it be to comply with the call that has been made of me. I 
rejoice in the spirit of this conference. I had not felt, I believe, before, 
as I have felt this morning, that there is safety in following counsel. 
I had not realized to the same extent that I do now, the closeness of 
temporal and spiritual things in the welfare and well-being of the peo- 
ple of the Church. It has been said by some that the "Mormon" 
people lay too much stress upon the temporal things of life, that 
they are not spiritual enough in their teachings; but, as the President 
said this morning, we know the consequences that have come to those 
who have disregarded the counsels of President Joseph F. Smith in 
the matter of getting out of debt, and keeping out of debt. Because 
of their failure to comply, disaster has come to them, and they now 
find it necessary, in many cases, to' abandon their property and to leave 
for new fields, to^ take their families into new environments and into 
environments which may be detrimental to their spiritual growth and 
advancement, that may be conducive to drawing therm away from the 
Church and its teachings. The President did not say so, and I do 
not say it, but I wondered if this is not just as good a time to put 
into effect today that counsel which was given several years ago, as 
it was then. No prophecy has been made, I think, from this stand 
to the effect that we are standing today in perilous times financially. 
No one has predicted that this wave of temporary prosperity shall 
continue — perhaps I should not say "temporary," because I hope it is 
not temporary, but the s'gns of the times would indicate, I think, that 
we are at least in a state of uncertainty, and while the financial clouds 
are lifting today, as they have been for several months — I have failed 
to find anyone who is keeping abreast of the times financially, to predict 
safety beyond the next few months, and there is always the proviso 
that for the next two or three, and some will say as far as six, 
months, there is apparent safety in matters of finance, but beyond 
that, no prediction is made. It occurs to me. brethren and sisters, 
that today is just as good a time to keep out of debt, to strive to gel 
out of debt, those of us who are in debt, as was the day when President 
Joseph F. Smith counseled it, and when other leaders of the Church 



ELDER JAMES W. FUNK 



21 



have counseled it, because, as I recall, they have always given ad- 
vice of that kind. It occurs to me, too, that one of the first duties that 
we owe, and we should not forget it, is the duty that we owe to the 
Lord : Pay your tithing - , brethren and sisters, in the time and the sea- 
son thereof, and that does not mean, to us who live in agricultural 
sections of the country, to pay our tithing in December, but it means 
to pay it every month of the year, as means come into our hands ; 
and then at the end of the year we will not be owing the Lord tithing 
that we should have been paying at the beginning of the year and 
throughout the months thereof. 

There is safety in counsel. It has been evidenced on every hand. 
That brother and that sister who follow the counsel of those who are 
placed in authority to lead us and guide us, will not go far wrong, 
but will be found in every crisis safe, standing not only safe as to 
themselves, but in a position to help and to assist those with whom 
they come in contact. I have a sincere testimony in the divinity of 
this work. I know that it is the work of God; I know that those 
who are in charge of the work at this present time are holding their 
positions because of their call from the Lord. They are answering 
the call that has come to them, and from my personal contact with 
these men, as it is my privilege, my very highly esteemed privilege, 
brethren and sisters, to come in contact with them occasionally, I 
testify to you who are not so favorably situated as to come in per- 
sonal and intimate contact with them, that they are men of God, 
sincere in their desires to lead the people in the way that God would 
have themi to go 1 , sincere in their teachings and in their living, with 
hearts full of prayer for the welfare of the people of this dispensation, 
and I am sure that God is inspiring them, leading them, that they 
may in turn inspire and lead us. May God bless the Latter-day Saints 
and help us at all times to do his will, is my prayer, in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 

(President of the Southern States Mission) 

Brethren and sisters, it is a good thing to live in the present. The 
Apostle Paul said : "But this one thing I do, forgetting those things 
which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are 
before, I press towards the mark, for the prize of the high calling 
of God in Christ Jesus." There was a people in days of old who 
garnished the tombs of the dead prophets but who persecuted, stoned 
and put to death the living prophets. I believe that if a man is in 
opposition to the President of the Chruch today, such a man would 
have been found in opposition to the Prophet Joseph Smith. I also 
believe that if there is a disloyal American in this country today he 



22 



GENERAL CONEERENCE 



would have been disloyal had he lived in (he days of George Wash- 
ington. 

In a conversation with a prominent minister, two or three years 
ago — he was a fine gentleman I believe, a good man — we discussed 
the great World War, and I said to him,: "Do you not think that 
[his great World War foreshadows some great event, such as the 
glorious second coming of the Son of God, to judge the people and 
to inaugurate the blessed millennium?" 

The minister replied : "I think so now ; but if a man had told us, 
eight years ago, that this World War would have fallen upon the 
world with all its horror, we would have laughed him to scorn and then 
crucified him." 

I said : "Doctor, men did crucify such a man. Joseph Smith, the 
Prophet of God, foretold the great Civil War ; he likewise predicted 
by the gift and the power of the Holy Ghost, that the World War 
would come to vex the nations. He died a martyr for the testimony 
of Jesus Christ." 

The mission of this Chruch is to preach the gospel, to cry re- 
pentance unto a crooked and perverse generation, and in this dispensa- 
tion the Almighty has declared that the whole world is ripening in 
iniquity, and it must needs be that the children of men be stirred 
up unto repentance. We have proved that God was as he always has 
been, as he always will be, right, for he knows what is in man. He 
said: "That by reason of transgression cometh the fall; which fall 
bringeth death ; and inasmuch as we were born into the world by water, 
and blood and the spirit which I have made and so became of dust 
a living soul, even so ye must be born again into the kingdom of 
heaven, of water and of the Spirit and be cleansed by blood even the 
blood of mine Only Begotten Son, that ye may be sanctified from all 
sin, and enjoy the words of eternal life in this world and eternal 
life in the world to come, even immortal glory. For by water ye keep 
the commandment; by the Spirit ye are justif'ed, and by the blood ye 
are sanctified. * * * This is the plan of salvation, unto all men, 
* * * and thus may all become my sons." The Apostle John said 
that every man that hath this hope in him, purifieth himself even as he, 
God, is pure. What hope? He tells us: "Beloved, now are we, 
the sons of God." In this glorious hope we do purify ourselves. 
But the pernicious, the groveling, theory which teaches, or seeks to teach 
that we came from a lower order of creation, that we came, from 
low decree, does not purify. But the gospel of Jesus Christ does 
purify us, for through it we know that we are the sons of God, that 
our heavenly Father is the Father of our spirits. 

I bear my humble testimony that the Gospel is the power of God 
unto salvation, "I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ," said Paul, 
"for it is the power of God unto salvation." Brethren and sisters, the 
Latter-day Saints are not only not ashamed of the gospel, but are not 
ashamed of its author, even Jesus Christ, for we testify that he is the 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 



23 



Son of God, the Redeemer of the world, the Savior of mankind, the 
author of eternal salvation ; and in this hope we will abide and progress 
to eternal life. This testimony is the strength of this Church, and 
may we ever abide in it is my humble prayer, in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen.

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

While Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon were engaged in trans- 
lating the Scriptures, they said : 

"And while we meditated upon these things," [the things they refer to were 
in regard to the resurrection] "The Lord touched the eyes of our understandings 
and they were opened, and the glory of the Lord shone round about, 

"And we beheld the glory of the Son, on the right hand of the Father, 
and received of his fulness ; 

"And saw the holy angels, and them who are sanctified before his 
throne, worshiping God and the Lamb, who worship him forever and ever. 

"And now, after the many testimonies which have been given of him, this 
is the testimony, last of all, which we give of him: That he lives! 

"For we saw him, even on the right hand of God ; and wc heard the 
voice bearing record that lie is the Only Regotten of the Father — 

"That by him, and through him, and of him, the worlds are and were 
created, and the inhabitants thereof are begotten sons and daughters unto God." 

Thank the Lord that Joseph Smith saw and conversed with the 
Redeemer, that the Redeemer of the world was introduced to him by 
God our Father. Thank the Lord that somebody else, in addition to 
Joseph Smith, has left us his testimony that Jesus is the Son of God, 
and that the voice from heaven bore record. Thank the Lord for the 
gospel. 

"And this is the gospel, the glad tidings, which the voice out of the 
heavens bore record unto us — 

"That he came into the world, even Jesus, to be crucified for the world, 
and to bear the sins of the world, and to sanctify the world, and to cleanse 
it from all unrighteousness ; 

"That through him all might be saved whom the Father had put into his 
power and made by him ." 

These passages came to my mind as I was listening to the re- 
marks of Brother Winslow Farr Smith. I want lo read just a few 
words for the benefit of all Latter-day Saints, from the first section 
of the Doctrine and Covenants : 

"Search these commandments, for they are true and faithful, and the 
prophecies which are in them shall all be fulfilled. 

"What I the Lord have spoken, I have spoken, and I excuse not myself; 
and though the heavens and the earth pass away, my word shall not pass 
away, but shall all be fulfilled, whether by mine own voice or by the voice 
of my servants, it is the same. 

"For behold, and lo, the Lord is God, and the Spirit beareth record, and 
the record is true, and the truth abideth forever and ever."

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



The choir and congregation sang, "High on the mountain top." 

Benediction was pronounced by Elder Lewis R. Anderson, presi- 
dent of the Manti Temple and former president of the South Sanpete 
stake. 

The Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock p. m. 



AFTERNOON SESSION 

The afternoon meeting was opened at 2 o'clock by President Heber 
J. Grant who announced that the choir and congregation would sing, 
"We thank thee, O God, for a Prophet." 

After 1 singing, prayer was offered by Elder Joseph R. Shepherd, 
president of the Logan Temple. 

Following prayer the choir and congregation sang, "O ye moun- 
tains high." 

PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE 

I thoroughly enjoyed the meeting this morning. I hope I shali 
enjoy the meeting this afternoon, and particularly, that while I speak 
to you I may be led by the Spirit which was here this, morning and 
prompted the remarks that were made, and which the Lord has blessed 
me with many times, at home and abroad, when it has become my duty 
to stand up before a congregation. 

I am suffering from some disabilites which are very unpleasant 
to me personally. They are of physical character but I am not sick 
abed. I am thankful indeed that I am able to be present this afternoon 
and look upon this vast congregation. I wish I could see you clearly, as 
I used to do in times that are, past, but my eyes are about worn out, 
I think, and I do not have any faith that I shall recover the keen eye- 
sight which I enjoyed for so many years; but I am thankful to God 
this afternoon to be present. 

THROUGH THE SPIRIT WE ARE FED THE BREAD OF LIFE 

I was grateful this morning, with all my soul, in listening to the 
remarks that were made by our brethern who spoke by the Spirit and 
from their hearts. I think we are able to tell when a man talks from the 
heart or merely from the brain. Some men who are accustomed to 
public speaking can roll out a very fine discourse or oration or lecture 
that comes from human thought, and it is subject to human errors, very 
often, and we can detect them ; but when a man speaks under the in- 
fluenec of the Holy Ghost, the Comforter, the Spirit of Truth, the 
light that comes from God to the soul of man, there is something 
about what he says that goes to our hearts, not only to our ears but it 
goes down into our inward being, and we are fed with the bread of 
life and we are nourished thereby and we carry away with us, when we 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE 25 



go home, or wherever we' go, the influence of it. It clings to us. It not 
only rings in our ears when we hear good sentences, but the spirit of 
it goes down into our inward being and we are refreshed and revived 
and fitted for the duties that devolve upon us as servants of the most 
high God. 

THE CHURCH THE MOST WONDERFUL ORGANIZATION 

One of the speakers said that this was one of the most wonderful 
organizations on the earth, all of which is true, but a word more might 
be added, — that it is the most wonderful. It is so, because it is different 
from anything else organized on earth in the shape of religion. There 
are many differences between our views, doctrines, and principles, and 
our way of doing things, and the various religions in the Christian and 
the heathen world, but there is this great difference ; everything in this 
Church is as directed by divine revelation. One of the brethren alluded to 
the manifestation of God, the Father and the Son, to the Prophet Joseph 
in his boyhood, something which he relates himself and we can read in 
the book called the Pearl of Great Price, which contains a great many 
things that we all ought to give heed to and understand. There are 
revelations in that little book that came direct from the Father through 
Jesus Christ his Son, to Moses, long before he gave the law on mount 
Sinai, which were revealed to him, in vision ; and the same visions 
that he gave to Moses were given to the Prophet Joseph, I think about 
June, 1830. They are of great moment and they contain great and 
glorious principles and promises. 

WHAT GOD REVEALES, ORDAINS AND COMMANDS IS HIS RELIGION 

One thing clearly revealed in that which God gave to Moses before 
he gave him the Mosaic law, as we call it, was the point that what God 
calls men to and ordains them, to and reveals unto them is his word and 
that it shall abide, and that it is different from that which comes from 
man only. He does not accept just what man may choose to offer him, 
either by way of sacrifice or by any other way. That which he ordains, 
that which he reveals, that which he commands is God's religion that 
comes to us, and that we should observe and obey. It is all right for 
all the inhabitants of earth, according to their own notions, to breathe 
out their desires to the Lord and to offer to him what they think is 
good for them to offer, but the Lord instituted sacrifices in the early 
times, and when our> parents were driven out of the Garden of Eden, 
Adam was told to build an altar and offer a sacrifice to the Lord, which 
was to be from the firstlings of his flock. Adam was a tiller of the 
soil, as well as keeper of flocks, but that which the Lord commanded 
him he did without question. When he was asked by the angel of God, 
so we read in that vision to Moses, why he did that, he said he did not 
know but he did know that God had commanded it. That was enough 
for him. Then the angel explained to him that this sacrifice that God 
commanded him to offer was in the similitude of the great sacrifice to 



26 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



be offered by the Only Begotten Son, Jesus the Christ. That was the 
name given to him by the Father, we are told. So Adam did that under- 
standingly; so did his son Abel; so did Seth, and so did others of his 
posterity, away down to the time of Enoch, Abraham, Isaac, Noah, 
Jacob and Moses. This was offered in the way that God ordained, and 
therefore it was acceptable in his sight. 

COD HAS SPOKEN IN THE TIME IN WHICH WE LIVE 

Now in these times in which we live, God has spoken again from 
heaven. For a long time there had been no direct intercourse between 
the Father and the Son and the inhabitants of the earth, by way of 
commandment and revelation. They were left, to a large extent, after 
they departed from the Gospel that his Son revealed, to their own de- 
vices ; and so confusion came into the world and "darkness covered the 
earth and gross darkness the people." In the midst of this, many of them 
thought they had great light, but tha't which they had came from 
their own reflections, to a large degree, and communication was not kept 
up between Deity and humanity. Now, when the Lord revealed him- 
self, as he most certainly did, as testified to this morning by the brethren, 
— and I add my testimony that the Father and the Son did manifest 
themselves to the boy Toseph in the grove near his father's house, where 
he went to offer for the first time a vocal prayer to God — and when he 
called upon the Father and asked him which of all the different religious 
sects he should join, the Father turning and pointing to his Son, said ; 
"Joseph, th's is my beloved Son. Hear him." That was the word of 
God the Father to Joseph the boy. That is the word of God to the 
whole earth today. It has come to us and we should remember it. 
It is what his Son Jesus Christ reveals, as the representative of the 
Father, that we are to receive. And so, all the revelations that have 
come to us, as referred to this morning by President Grant, contained 
in the Doctrine and Covenants, which is a collection of revelations 
from the Lord, came through Jesus Christ, "Hearken to the voice of 
Jesus Christ, the great I Am, whose arm of mercy hath atoned for your 
sins," is the opening phrase in many of those revelations. 

CELESTIAL OR ETERNAL MARRIAGE 

The Lord has disclosed to us in section 132 of the Doctrine and 
Covenants, a revelation concerning his ways and concerning things of 
time and things of eternity. Among them is the law of celestial or eternal 
marriage. That is only one of the principles revealed there. Here is 
what the Lord says in verses 8 to 11 of that section in the Doctrine and 
Covenants : 

"Behold, mine house is a house of order, saith the Lord God, and not a 
house of confusion. 

"Will I accept of an offering, saith the Lord, that is not made in my 
name ? 

"Or will I receive at your hands that which I have not appointed? 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE 



27 



"And will I appoint unto you, saith the Lord, except it be by law, even 
as I and my Father ordained unto you, before the world was?' 

Just think that over. That is an eternal principle. God reveals 
what he wants done and his people are to abide by it and carry it out 
in their lives. 

The revelation goes on to say : 

"I am the Lord thy God, and I give unto you this commandment — That 
no man shall come unto the Father but by me or by my word, which is my 
law, saith the Lord. 

"And everything that is in the world, whether it be ordained of men, by- 
thrones, or principalities, or powers, or things of name, whatsoever they may be, 
that are not by me or by my word, saith the Lord, shall be thrown down, and 
shall not remain after men are dead, neither in nor after the resurrection, saith 
the Lord your God. 

"For whatsoever things remain are by me ; and whatsoever things are not 
by me shall be shaken and destroyed." 

Based upon this principle, the Lord continues : 

"Therefore, if a man marry a wife in the world, and he marry her not by 
me, nor by my word, and he covenant with her so long as he is in the world, 
and she with him, their covenant and marriage arc not of force when they 
are dead, and when they are out of the world. Therefore, they are not bound 
by any law when they are out of the world." 

Further than this the Lord goes on to say : 

"And again, verily I say unto you. if a man marry a wife and make a 
covenant with her for time and all eternity, if that covenant is not by me or 
by my word, which is my law, and is not sealed by the Holy Spirit of 
promise, through him whom T have anointed and appointed unto this power, 
then it is not valid, neither of force when they are out of the world, because 
they are not joined by me,neither by my word." 

So, therefore, the Lord institutes his order of eternal marriage 
and he warns his people that unless they abide by that law their union 
cannot be continued, they cannot increase in the world to come, and 
their marriage does not last any longer than the time that they live in 
the flesh. After death comes that is the end of it. 

SHOW THE CHILDREN WHAT THE LORD ORDAINS AND WHY 

Now why should the Lord accept of all those different religions 
that men have made? Why should the Lord accept of offerings that 
men offer which he has not commanded, and neglected to do that 
which he has commanded? There is no reason in my irr'nd 
why he should. Therefore, says the Lord, if men do this and they do 
not abide by his law, it does not continue. So, here is something we 
should understand and teach to our children. Mothers and fathers 
in Israel, make it plain to your children, not in an offensive way, as 
some have done, but show them what the Lord ordains and why he or- 
dains it, so that they may, if they will, enter into the new and everlast- 
ing covenant of marriage as God has ordained, do that which will con- 
tinue in and after the resurrection from the dead and abide eternally ; 



28 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



wherein they will find everlasting increase and power and dominion 
worlds without end. 

LEARN WHAT THE LORD HAS COMMANDED AND OBEY IT 

In the sectarian world there are a number of religious organiza- 
tions. All of them, perhaps most of them at any rate, have some good 
in them. That which is good and true is all right ; but there is not one 
of them according to that revelation, that has been set up and ordained 
by direct commandment of the Lord. This Church is sui generis. It is 
of itself. There is no other organization on the face of the earth that 
has been organized under direct revelation and commandment of the 
Most High, and organized personally under the direction of Jesus 
Christ, the Only Begotten Son of God in the flesh. Hear him, O ye 
nations ! Hear him, O ye Latter-day Saints ! Find out what the Lord 
has commanded and obey it and there shall be peace in your souls and 
you shall have contentment, not only the remission of your past sins, 
but you shall have the abiding witness in your souls that gave so much 
comfort to our brethren who spoke this morning, and we can all have 
it, as one of them testified. 

Now then, that is the principle upon which that commandment is 
founded, by which our people are told to enter into the sacred order 
of celestial, that is, eternal marriage. If a man marry a wife in the new 
and everlasting covenant and it is sealed upon their heads that that 
marriage shall endure, and they live according to it, they shall come 
forth in the first resurrection, and they will continue in it forever and 
ever and there is no end to their increase and their glory and their do- 
minion and their power. It leads to infinitude, which we cannot fully 
comprehend now but which we will when we receive that Spirit in its 
fulness and receive our resurrected bodies, quickened after the power 
of endless life; we enter into an infinitude of knowledge which will 
come to us as the ages and ages go on and there is no end to it. 

THE LORD HAS SET UP HIS CHURCH AND KINGDOM 

Now, I know this is true. I know it just as I know that I live, 
that the Lord, in these last days, has commenced the work referred to 
by all the holy prophets since the world began, to set up his Church 
and kingdom. This is "the kingdom of God." This is the kingdom 
of heaven into which no one can enter except in the way that the Lord 
has provided. Christ says : "I am the way, the truth and the life. 
No man cometh to the Father but by me," and "If any man will do 
his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether 
I speak of myself." And he has declared that we cannot enter into 
the kigndom except by the door, not only for the remission of sins but 
to enter into that Church and kingdom of God. That is what he 
taught to Nicodemus. He told Nicodemus, first, he "could not see the 
kingdom unless he was born again ;" and the Apostles taught, in their 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE 29 



letters to the churches of their time, that they had to be "born of the 
word of God" that comes through Christ, which opens the eyes, which 
enables people to see the truth. "Faith cometh by hearing, and hear- 
ing by the word of God," says Paul. But, how can they hear without 
a preacher, and how can he preach except he be sent? (Rom. 13 :17.) 
That is the idea. God sends men to speak his word by the power of 
the Holy Ghost, and the Spirit resting down upon the hearers who 
are willing to recive it, kindles faith in their souls by the testimony that 
is born and they see the light right here. And then very often, in our 
public gatherings, in the streets and in our meeting places, and by 
seeing that which is right, faith is kindled in their hearts, which is 
the beginning of the gospel of Christ, the beginning of true religion. 
Faith in the true God is the beginning of true religion, and that 
leads to repentance. This is what Oliver Cowdery could not under- 
stand when he had that dispute with the Prophet Joseph, in the rise 
of the Church. The revelation says that all who have "received the 
Spirit of Christ unto the remission of their sins shall be received by 
baptism into the Church." (Doc. and Cov. sec. 20:37.) Oliver could 
not understand that, and he had the hardihood or assumption to call 
upon the Prophet Joseph, in the name of God, to erase that from the 
revelation, but of course the Prophet did not erase it. He had received 
it from the Lord and it is the eternal truth. What the people of the 
world need is something to lead them up to repentance, and then to be 
baptized for the remission of sins, and this is the operation, the first 
operation of the Spirit of Christ in the soul of man. Seeing the king- 
dom and entering into it are different operations. When he hears the 
word and believes it, faith is kindled in his heart and it leads to re- 
pentance, and repentance to baptism, wherein . is the remission of sins, 
and he comes in by the door into the Church or Kingdom of Christ, 
and is then confirmed by the laying on of the hands that he may receive 
the gift of the Holy Ghost ; that is the Holy Ghost as a gift, an abiding 
witness, a continual testimony, .something that stays in the soul, not 
given like a flash of light for a time and taken away again, not like 
the temporary light that lights every man that comes into the world, 
although it is from the same source; but the abiding witness as a gift 
from God, as Peter taught on the day of Pentecost, when the Jews 
began to see that they had been in the dark and that their nation had 
rejected the Messiah. They cried: "Men and brethren, what shall 
we do ?" Then said Peter : "Repent and be baptized every one of you, 
in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall 
receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto you, 
and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the 
Lord our God shall call ;" all that receive the word, if they believe and 
repent and are baptized they shall receive the Holy Ghost. They are 
first born of the word, next born of the water and of the Spirit. ( Read 
I Peter 1:23; Jas. 1:18.)

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ONLY ONE GOD'S RELIGION 

Now, my brethren, in the different sections in the world they have 
their religions and a great many of our people are being led off here 
and there, particularly out in the world, to attend their services. There 
is no harm about that, but they should come to the understanding that 
there is but one God's religion and that is what God reveals. There is 
only one gospel and that is the gospel of Jesus Christ, about which 
President Grant read this morning from that glorious vision that Joseph 
Smith, the prophet, received, with Sidney Rigdon. He saw it. Sidney- 
saw it, and it is one of the biggest testimonies that although he 
had to lie cut off this Church for his transgressions, yet he never 
denied his testimony ; and so with the three witnesses to the Book of 
Mormon. They say what they testified of, and their testimony remains 
and abides and what they said is true. Now then, we want to teach 
our children that they may understand that there may be good things 
in the religions of the world and in the educations of the world ; that 
which is good is all right, that which is really scientific is all right, 
but a great deal of what is called scientific is nothing but philosophical, 
and some of it is vain philosophy. The Lord is our God and he cre- 
ated or organized the world on which we stand, as he organized many 
other worlds, as shown to Moses, and he gives his word to the people 
to obey, and that which he reveals should be obeyed. 

THE LORD'S PLAN FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF HIS CHURCH 

In the discipline of his Church, he has created a splendid estab- 
lishment, or organization. We understand it and we should get to un- 
derstand it fully. I recommend, my brethren, and measurably my 
sisters, to become fully acquainted with Section 107 of the Doctrine 
and Covenants, in which the organization of this Church is embodied 
and set forth in great plainness. There is the Lord's plan for the 
government of his Church. Now, when his servants whom he has 
called and set apart and ordahied to certain offices and work in the 
Church, bring forth something for the obedience and edification and 
order of the Church of Christ by the power of the Holy Ghost in them, 
by the authority that he has revealed, — the Holy Priesthood referred 
to this morning 1 — it is of the Lord. He says so. He has ordained and 
set up his Church in that form, and that which he has given to us will 
abide. It will never be taken from the earth. Some of the people 
want to know what we will do if the First Presidency is dissolved 
by death and the Twelve Apostles are all gone. What then? That is 
an if you need not bother yourselves about. There will always be 
somebody on the earth in this Church that can set in order the things 
of the kingdom ; but if they do it, it will be done by the commandment 
of God, by revelation from the Most High, the Eternal Father, through 
Jesus Christ his Son, who is at the head of the Church. This is his 
Church, — the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, — and we 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE 



31 



should be ready and willing to obey every commandment that he re- 
veals ; and the order established therein is of God and it will continue 
and abide and spread forth and prevail. Hear it, O Israel ! Be obe- 
dient to the Lord your God, as revealed from, the heavens through 
Jesus Christ, and it will be done to the Church in the order and man- 
ner that he has prescribed and set up, for his house is a house of order 
and not a house of confusion. When people have the presumption 
to go off on the side, on the right or left, or in any direction they please, 
and officiate in the Lord's name in things that do not belong to them, 
it is void and of non-effect ; and so with the ordinances and adminis- 
trations of men not authorized of God and not clothed upon with the 
authority of the Holy Priesthood that comes through Jesus Christ, the 
Son of God, to the Ghurch. 

PERSONAL TESTIMONY 

I do not want to enlarge on this any further, because I would he 
taking up too much time. I have occupied a little more than my time 
this afternoon. But, brethren and sisters, I feel well in mind, in spirit, 
in all my being. The Lord has been with me through my ministra- 
tions in many lands, for many years. I have preached this gospel 
in many of the states of the Union, throughout the British Isles, through 
the continent of Europe, in the Scandinavian countries,and on some of 
the isles of the sea ; and I am ready to do anything I am told to do 
that the Lord may require at my hands, I am pleased and proud lo be 
associated with the present President and leader of the Church. Like 
one of the brethren who spoke this morning, I have been personally 
acquainted with them all from the days of Brigham Young right down 
to the present time, and I can testify that they are men of God and that 
they occupied those places they held by the word and will and com- 
mandment of God and in the authority of that Holy Priesthood which 
has been restored to earth. 

I know this Church and organization is different from anything 
else in the world. It is of God and not of man. That which is of 
man, so far as it is of man, is from men who are ordained and ap- 
pointed to represent the Lord, to act in his holy name, under the di- 
rection of his authority and priesthood, and I testify to you that it shall 
continue to abide though many of us will pass away. 

I rejoice today in the truth. I rejoice in the testimony of Jesus. 
I rejoice in the knowledge that Christ did give me my freedom, I am 
free. How? Free from the sins that were remitted at the waters of 
baptism, free from the vanities and vain conceptions of men, free from 
folly in doctrine and principle, free from the influence that men would 
exercise to bind my soul. I am free to carry out the will and com- 
mandments of the Lord, which I hope to be during the remainder of 
my existence on the earth. I have devoted my life and time and what 
ability I have had, for many years to the service of the Church. I re- 
joice in that. The Church doesn't owe me anything. I owe everything 
that there is to me to the Church, and I love it and I love the truth. I

love my brethren and I love the good work in which I am engaged, 
and I love you, my brethren and sisters in the gospel of peace, and I 
desire your welfare and that of your posterity, for in that will be a 
great deal of your joy in the worlds to come, — in your children and 
children's children. 

THE SPEAKER'S BENEDICTION UPON THE PEOPLE 

God bless you, as he blessed Ephraim, and in your seed many 
of the nations of the earth will be blessed. Through them God will 
work out his mighty plans, many of which are not yet disclosed ; and 
the kingdom of God will roll on and the truth will be triumphant and 
darkness will be banished and the reign of evil will cease. Satan 
will be bound and his hosts with him, and the wicked will not con- 
tinue to flourish. The righteous will prevail and the kingdom and 
government of God which he has set up will cover the earth until the 
very earth itself, having filled the law of its being, will be resurrected 
and clothed upon with the glory of God, and Christ will be its king. 

God bless you, brethren and sisters. May his peace abide with 
you and be in your homes, surround your homes with everything that 
is good, bright, lovely and comfortable. Teach your children in kind- 
ness to come up in the way that God Almighty has established and that 
is going to prevail. It is going to be the kingdom. The kingdoms of 
this world will become the kingdom of our God and his Christ, and he 
will reign forever and ever. May we all be found worthy to reign 
with him in glory, through Jesus Christ. Amen. 

Two little girls, Florence and Blanche Critchlow of Ogden. sang 
a duet, the old, familiar hymn, "O My Father." 

Their voices were clear and distinct and every word could be heard 
throughout the whole, great congregation. 

President Grant, at the close of their singing, stated that these chil- 
dren should teach some of our professionals how to' sing so that we 
could understand the words. He announced also that amplifiers had 
been placed in the Tabernacle, to aid the congregation in hearing the 
speakers, and that if there were any who were standing who could not 
hear, they would be able to hear what was being said in the Assembly 
Hall and have a good seat. 



ELDER EDWARD W. CROFT 

{President of the Bighorn Stake of Zion) 

I have been coming to the general conferences of the Church, my 
brethren and sisters, for over thirty years. I feel today that I am hon- 
ored, and that it is a privilege granted me this day to look into the faces 
of so many of my brethren and sisters. I am thankful above 
all other things in the world that this day, my brethren and 



ELDER EDWARD W. CROFT 



33 



sisters, I find my soul in tune with this great and marvelous work that 
has been established by our heavenly Father. I was impressed with 
the statement of President Grant this morning that there were only a 
very few of the general authorities now left who were present at the 
dedication of the wonderful temple. I remembered that I had been 
listening to a great many of the brethren, and I was thankful in my 
heart that I could say truthfully that in all I have ever heard or ever 
read from them, I have been able to find myself in harmony with 
them. I am glad this day that I have a testimony of the gospel of 
Jesus Christ, that I retain it as delivered to me from my mother and 
father who received the gospel in England many years ago. I am 
proud of the fact that I can, in humility, be counted worthy to assist, 
in my humble, feeble way, in the great and wonderful work of the 
Lord. I am laboring in the Big Horn stake of Zion. You remember 
that some twenty-two^ years ago, the people were called to colonize that 
country, and I am certain that there are brethren and sisters here who 
will be glad to know of the success of the work of God in that country, 
because of the fact that we were called there, a great many of us. With 
some of the other brethren who spoke this morning, I can say that we 
are somewhat in bondage, in debt, because we failed to follow the 
counsels of the authorities of this great organization; and while our 
lands, some of them, are mortgaged and boggy, I would like to bring 
to the Church the message from our stake that we have very few peo- 
ple who have mortgages on their faith in God, and their confidence 
in the leaders of this Church, and in the Priesthood of Almighty God. 
Two weeks ago last Sunday we held a little district conference over in 
a district of our stake, and the bishop and ward clerk announced that 
there were one hundred percent of the Latter-day Saints present in 
that meeting, within a radius of ten miles of the meetinghouse. It has 
been a pleasure to me, my brethren and sisters, to labor in that stake 
of Zion. 

I am also thankful, today, that from the little study I have made 
of the science in which I am practicing, that of a practicing physician, 
I have not found anything in the healing arts that begins to com- 
pare with the healing power of the Priesthood, and the prayer of 
faith, following the anointing with oil. I would like to testify to you 
this afternoon, my brethren and sisters, that with all the ability that 
I have been able to acquire in the diagnosis of disease, I have found, 
in the wonderful faith of our people, that the promised blessings do 
follow the believer! in Jesus Christ, in the wonderful things that he said 
would follow the believer ; and that notwithstanding the fact that I spend 
a good many more hours in the practice of medicine than I spend in the 
preaching of the gospel, and in my labors in the Big Horn stake of 
Zion, I find that all of the diseases, irrespective of the fact that they 
are produced by germs, many of them specifically, give way before 
the prayer of faith, and that in pneumonia and heart trouble, in frac- 
tured bones and in all these things that the human body is heir to, I 
• 2

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



have found the prayer of faith accomplishing all and more, yes a thou- 
sand times more, than we have heen able to accomplish, in many re- 
spects, as a profession. 

My brethren and sisters, 1 know that this is the work of God. I 
know that my acquaintance with all of the leaders since President 
Brigham Young has taught me that they have been men of God. I 
have been personally acquainted, slightly, with each of them, and I 
can testify to you this day that I have not been able to see anything 
else than success following all of our people who believe and follow 
the instructions of the authorities of this Church. Once more I say 
that I am more than thankful this day that in all the journeys I have 
made to the general conferences, 1 have been able to' find myself in 
harmony with everything that has heen taught and advocated by the 
brethren, and where I have put it into practice, success has followed 
my efforts. I testify to you that God lives. I know that he is my 
Father ; I know that he is the Father of our spirits, I know that Jesus 
Christ is his Son, his Only Begotten Son in the flesh, and I thank God 
this day that I do know that lie is my Redeemer. 1 testify to you that 
Joseph Smith was and is a prophet of God, chosen and selected to do 
a marvelous work and a wonder, and I am thankful, that I can find 
myself in touch and in tune with the teachings that he gave the hatter- 
day Saints. It is our privilege to follow his direction, and the direction 
of those whom God has chosen to succeed him, even unto the present 
day, and thereby be saved in the celestial kingdom of God. 1 thank my 
Father for this privilege- for this blessing of meeting in this confer- 
ence. I am very thankful that my part of it is over with ; but it is an 
honor to any man to face a congregation of Latter-day Saints such as 
this. 1 love the people of God. My professional work has taken me in- 
to their homes. 1 can testify to all the world that the Latter-day Saint 
home, guided and directed by the Spirit of God, is the most wonderful 
place in all the world. It makes men and women good, pure, and holy, 
and prepares them to do the wonderful work that God has revealed 
through his servants. May the Spirit of (Sod be with us, and bless us 
and strengthen us, that we might receive it with open hearts and with 
thanksgiving unto him, and with gratitude for all the blessings that 
this conference may be the greatest conference we ever attended, I ask 
it in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER HEBER C. AUSTIN 

{President of the Bingham Stake of Zion) 

I feel, my brethren and sisters, very weak, in attempting to occupy 
this position for just a few moments. 1 assure you I desire an interest 
in your faith and prayers, that 1 may be led to say something that 
will be in harmony with the spirit of this conference. I have been 
delighted with the instructions and the testimonies given to us, and 
borne to us, by our brethren who have spoken. I was delighted with 



ELDER HEBER C. AUSTIN 



35 



the remarks of President Grant this morning wherein he gave the 
statistics of the Church. We observed there the wonderful things 
that this Church is accomplishing, the wonderful things that it has 
accomplished, not only in spiritual matters, but in temporal matters. I 
have never been one of those who have felt to find fault with the tem- 
poral activities of the Church. I believe that it is very hard to draw 
the line where the spiritual things should cease and the temporal things 
begin. I realize that this Church and the activities of the Church have 
not only been the spiritual salvation of its members, but have been their 
temporal salvation, and if we would listen to the counsel and instruc- 
tions that are given to us, from time to time, by our brethren here, we 
would not find ourselves in the troubles that we sometimes do. The 
fact of disobedience is always followed by serious consequences. 

Like my brethren who have spoken to you in the sessions of this 
conference, both this morning and this afternoon, I rejoice in the fact 
that I have been permitted to associate with these splendid men who 
constitute the general authorities of this Church. I find myself in per- 
fect harmony with them. I sustain them with all my soul; and the 
people whom I represent, whom I have the honor to preside over in the 
Bingham stake of Zion, in the Snake River valley of Idaho, sustain the 
authorities of the Church. We never hear of any murmuring, we never 
hear of any complaints ; and we are endeavoring and seeking to live 
our religion. We are not always obedient to the counsel and advice 
given to us. If we were our condition would not be what it is today. 
I remember very well the brethren repeatedly, in their visits to our 
quarterly conferences, have advised our people to get out of debt 
and keep out of debt, and had we listened to that counsel it would 
have been a great bles-sing to us. 

I find myself, however, like one of the brethren who spoke this 
morning, that I have endeavored to obey that counsel. I am not in 
debt, and I suppose if I were I would not be able to pay. But let that 
be as it may. I know that the brethren are inspired by the Lord to ad- 
vise and counsel the Latter-day Saints, and I know that in obeying their 
counsel there is safety. You have heard many hard-luck stories" about 
our people. I think probably we have been represented really worse 
than we are. In my visits to Salt Lake, from time to time, my friends 
come up and condole with me in the very serious condition that pre- 
vails in our section of country. Well, in a measure it is serious, but 
it is not so bad as you think it is. The great majority of our people 
are sound financially. We have some small percent. I suppose, that 
will eventually find themselves in bankruptcy, but the great majority, 
a good percentage of our people, are sound financially. If we exer- 
cise a little patience, a little helpful influence, a little encouragement 
because we have in that section of country the best, yes I think the 
best agricultural district in the intermountain country, we shall pull 
through. I don't know Of a section of country, anywhere, where you 
can produce more to the acre than you can in the Snake River valley, 



36 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



amply supplied with an abundance of water, a splendid climate and a 
good soil. We have, probably, during' the time of our prosperity, dur- 
ing the time of easy money, gotten away from the habit of industry to 
some extent. We may have thought that we could afford to retire and 
employ someone else to do our work, and we shall have to return to 
first principles. We ourselves, have to learn, and also teach our fam- 
ilies, to be industrious, and when we do that we shall find ourselves on 
the road to recovery. 

I rejoice in the gospel. Like many of the other brethren who have 
spoken, I was born of splendid, good parents who made all sorts of 
sacrifices, if you could call it sacrifice, to embrace tbe gospel. They 
passed through the trials and tribulations, many of them, of the early 
history of this Church, and they implanted in the hearts of their chil- 
dren a testimony of the gospel. Like my brother who has spoken be- 
fore me, I know that the gospel is true. I know that Joseph Smith 
was a prophet of the Lord, and I know that these brethren who have 
stood at the head of this Church from that time till now have been 
called and sustained of the Lord. May the Lord bless us and help 
us, 1 pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JAMES DUCKWORTH 

{President of the Blackfoot Stake of Zion) 

Those who have had the privilege of occupying this position can 
appreciate the feelings of one who is unaccustomed to it as I am, and 
I realize unless I am assisted by the Spirit of the Lord in my remarks 
that I shall not edify the Latter-day Saints. I have no thought in my 
heart at this time other than to say what shall be pleasing to the Lord, 
and tend to strengthen and to edify and to build up his people. I 
rejoice in the latter-day work, and for the privilege of being a mem- 
ber in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It has always 
been a pleasure to me to bear testimony of the divinity of this work, and 
of the divine mission of the Redeemer of the world and of the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, as well as all of his successors in the presidency of the 
Church. One thing I have appreciated very much in my labors, in the 
Blackfoot stake, and that has been this: During the years that have 
passed since I was appointed to preside over that stake, I have had the 
privilege of entertaining nearly all of the general authorities of the 
Church, at times, and I want to bear testimony to the character of the 
men who have presided, and those who now preside over the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The Savior said: "By their 
fruits ye shall know them," and I know from my experience with these 
brethren, coming in contact with them, I know in my heart that they 
are men of God, and that they have brought into my home the Spirit 
and blessing of the Almighty. I have regarded their visits to my 
home as a privilege to be highly esteemed, both by myself and by my 



ELDER JAMES DUCKWORTH 



37 



family. I have learned, or ought to have learned, rather, that the only 
safety for the Latter-day Saints lies in keeping the counsel of those 
who preside over this Church. Like many of my brethren, I have not 
always done that which I have been asked to do, but I have never 
known them to give counsel except that which was right and which 
would bring the blessings of God the eternal Father. That has been 
my experience, and I testify of this in regard to the counsels that have 
been given by these brethren. Every principle which they have ad- 
vocated, every word of counsel which they have given in the Blackfoot 
stake, has been good, and calculated to edify and build up the Latter- 
day Saints there, both temporally and spiritually. I have rejoiced in 
my labors in the stakes. There is nothing that I like in this world better 
than to labor as a missionary in this Church, in an effort to bring souls 
to a knowledge of the truth, and I hope that as long as I shall live upon 
the earth, I may be true to those who preside over this Church, to 
the principles of life and salvation, and to God the eternal Father. I 
bear testimony to the divinity of this work, that it is of God, that it 
is not of men. It has not been organized of men, only as they were 
directed and inspired by the Almighty, and it has been watched over 
by the Father from the beginning, and I have faith that it will con- 
tinue to be the case to the end, that this is God's work, and that he will 
take care of it ; that no matter what we may hear about the leaders of 
the Church from time to time, we may have an abiding assurance that 
the Lord is with them, that he is guiding them and the destiny of this 
work. May the Lord help us to be true to him and to his work, to do 
all that may be asked of us, by those who shall preside over us, that we 
may spend our time in usefulness and therefore in happiness while we 
labor here in mortality, for there is no happiness aside from doing that 
which is right and just in the sight of God. Wickedness never was 
happiness. Righteousness always was, and it always will be. May 
the Lord give us strength to be true to the end of our days, I pray, in 
the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER WILLIAM L. ADAMSON 

(President of the Blain Stake of Zion) 

I am indeed grateful to my heavenly Father, on this occasion, my 
brethren and sisters, that in my weakness I can bear my testimony unto 
you that I know God lives, that I know Jesus is the Christ, and that in 
this dispensation a prophet of God has been raised up to make known 
unto the world the wonderful truths that God would have revealed un- 
to his people, Israel. I thought this morning, as we saw our beloved 
President stand before us, of the words of the ancient prophet, wherein 
he said : "Where there is no vision the people perish." And it seems to 
me that this scripture has been fulfilled in behalf of the Latter-day 
Saints to the utmost, because from the moment that the Father and 



38 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Son appeared unto the boy Prophet, and that glorious vision burst up- 
on his soul, the wonderful power of vision and heavenly 
manifestation has been constantly before this people. The 
wonderful power of vision that the Prophet had in directing and estab- 
lishing this work and in leading his people from place to place under 
such trying ordeals, surely must demonstrate to the world be- 
yond all question of doubt as well as to this people, that he 
was indeed a mighty prophet. The wonderful vision of that mighty 
prophet Brigham Young as he started on his journey westward over a 
thousand miles of trackless waste, — the faith that was instilled 
within his soul was not of the present, but of the future, and as he 
saw this people established in their strength and in their might in the 
midst of these Rocky mountains, what was the thing that urged him on? 
That vision of the future which he beheld, that he knew he was being 
led, with his people, by Almighty God. When he stood overlooking this 
valley and saw this waste of wilderness, and he said: "This is the 
place," surely it was the vision of the future which he beheld that in- 
spired him on, to bring that little band of pilgrims into this wonderful 
intermountain country ; and each of our leaders in turn, each with his 
own mission and his own particular work to perform, all have beheld 
and made known to the people the wonderful visions of the future, 
which they have seen. I wish to testify that I know that our leaders are 
men of God, that their time and their energy and their lives are dedi- 
cated to the work and to the welfare and well-being of the Latter-day 
Saints. May God give us strength to appreciate their worth to us as 
a people, and their ability to lead us and to direct us as God would have 
us led and directed. May we have faith to follow where they lead, that 
we may all be led safely back to our Father and our God, I pray in his 
name. Amen. 

ELDER REY L. PRATT 

{President of the Mexican Mission) 

I am very happy, my brethren and sisters, to have the privilege this 
afternoon of bearing my testimony to you relative to the truthfulness 
of the gospel as it has been restored in this day and age in which we 
live. When the Savior of the world questioned his disciples as to whom 
men .said that he was, we find, after various answers given by differ- 
ent ones, that Peter answered distinctly: "Thou art the Christ, the 
Son of the living God." He was informed by the Master that flesh 
and blood had not revealed this unto him, but that his Father in heaven 
had revealed to him this great truth. The Savior speaking to Peter 
said : "Upon this rock I will build my Church, and the gates of hell 
shall not prevail against it." I am reminded that ninety-three years 
ago today, the Church of Jesus Christ was organized and established, 
and from that beginning has been built upon the rock of revelation. It 
is marvelous to contemplate the structure. It is marvelous when we 



ELDER REY L. PRATT 



39 



contemplate how it seems that the very gates of hell have been arrayed 
against this work from the day of its inception, that in no way or de- 
gree have they prevailed against it. My mind has reverted back over 
the history of the Church today, and it seems to me that in the marvel- 
ous structure that has been built upon the rock of revelation not one 
single stone has been misplaced, neither has one had to be taken down 
or set aside ; and the structure stands today as a testimony that it is 
built upon the rock of revelation. More than ever before in my life 
there has been borne in upon my soul the truth of this fact that 
Joseph Smith was in very deed a Prophet of God. I bear yon my wit- 
ness, brethren and sisters, that I know that God spoke to him. He ap- 
peared to him in person, and our Father in beaven introduced to him in 
this age in which we live, the Savior of the world, his Son, wbo died 
upon the cross, who had in himself, as the Father has, life ; and he took 
up his life, even after he was crucified, becoming the first fruits of the 
resurrection. I testify to you that by revelation from that God to Jo- 
seph Smith the Church has been established, and that it stands, and I 
bear my testimony likewise that those who have succeeded in the presi- 
dency of the Church, from then until now, are prophets of the Lord, 
inspired by him. My heart and my soul thrill with this truth. 

I wish to bear to you my testimony also concerning that great vol- 
ume of scripture which I am sometimes led to believe we do not appre- 
ciate, namely the Book of Mormon, which is a record, brethren and 
sisters, that was written by prophets inspired of the Lord, and it came 
forth in this day and age in which we live by the inspiration of the 
Lord. It contains the truth of the everlasting gospel. Not one single 
thing recorded in that geat volume has ever been controverted by any 
discovery of any nature whatsoever that has been made since it was 
brought out in the world. It has been my good fortune to travel some- 
what in fields rich in archaeology, in this country, and I bear you my 
testimony that not one spade of earth has been overturned that has re- 
vealed a single thing except what is corroborative of the Book of Mor- 
mon and its being a divine record. 

It is my faith and prayer that this work will go on to triumph. I 
know that it will. I sense and realize, my brethren and sisters, because 
of the work, perhaps, that I have been engaged in for some years, that 
there is a very great responsibility resting upon the people of this 
Church to bear this testimony before the world. We sometimes imag- 
ine that we have warned the nations of the world, but still those of us 
intimately engaged in the missionary work know that there are thou- 
sands and millions of people who have not yet intelligently come in con- 
tact with these great truths, and the responsibility is upon us of carry- 
ing the gospel message to the nations of the earth, for the Savior of the 
world has decreed that this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in 
all the world as a witness, and then shall the end come : and I say it 
shall not come until this shall have been an accomplished fact. 

Brethren and sisters, this responsibility rests upon us. In our 



40 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



homes let tis breathe the missionary spirit, that our sons and daughters 
may grow up with a realization of the great work that devolves upon 
them. Let there be some little thought toward the preparation neces- 
sary, for it is a fact that a great deal of preparation for usefulness is 
made after missionaries come into the missionary field, preparation that 
might well have been made in our homes, at our firesides, by the teach- 
ings of the fathers and the mothers to their children, seconded, of 
course, by the work of the great auxiliary organizations which are 
in the Church. I hope that in the future as we grow in faith, in testi- 
mony and in the knowledge of these things, we will grow in useful- 
ness and in preparation, that we may be pillars of strength wherever 
the Lord calls us to labor, and that we will bear off triumphantly, so 
far as we are concerned, this greatest of all great works in the world. 
May the Lord bless us and help us to this end is my prayer, in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER S. NORMAN LEE 

(President of the Box Elder Stake of Zion) 

These conference proceedings, up to this time, have been rather 
exciting for some of us. That has been the case with me ever since I 
discovered that the President was calling on .speakers in the alphabetical 
order of the names of their stakes. 

Brother Duckworth said that those who occupied this position 
knew what the feeling was. I might add that only those who have 
occupied this position know what the feeling is, surrounded as we 
are by men whom we have learned to revere, men in whose presence 
I have always felt very humble, men whom I have learned to love, as I 
have come to know them better. And then to be faced with such a 
vast audience ! I am thankful indeed that the faces within the radius 
of my sight are all friendly faces. That is very comforting. I have 
faced audiences much smaller than this, but more formidable, in a 
sense, in that many of them were unfriendly, and I think I may depend 
upon you, my brethren and sisters, to offer up a prayer in my behalf 
that I may get through this experience satisfactorily. 

It is difficult, when one sits down to consider the various prin- 
ciples of the gospel, to determine which of them should be stressed, 
because of the importance of so many of the principles of the gospel. 
There are circumstances, however, that bring into relief some of the 
principles of the gospel more than others, and just at this time I am 
concerned very much with the financial condition of our people. I 
am lending money as an agent, and it falls to my lot very often to 
urge people to pay up their interest. T have quit urging them to pay 
on the principal, because that does not happen nowadays, except in very 
isolated cases; but I do urge them to pay up their interest, and keep 
their loans in good standing, and some of the tales that are brought to 
me are really heart-breaking. One of the brethren, Brother Austin I 



ELDER S. NORMAN LEE 



41 



think, said that the condition of the people in Idaho had been repre- 
sented to be worse than it actually is. That may have been done by 
people who came in contact with borrowers who were not able to pay 
up, and they have judged the entire community by the condition of 
those few. Now, jn our community, which, by the way, I think is in 
every way the equal of the Snake River valley in the products of the 
soil, or in other ways, we have a great many people who are not able to 
pay their debts. They did not hearken to the counsel of the servants 
of the Lord, and there is one thing that stands out very prominently 
I think, and I consider that item almost unconsciously whenever I have 
occasion to deal with such a case. I am referring to the matter of 
the payment of tithes. I think that tithing is the economic law of sal- 
vation, or is the law of economic salvation to our people. I don't be- 
lieve that Latter-day Saints can expect to prosper constantly and con- 
tinuously if they ignore that very important law. It is a combination 
of material things and spiritual thing; that the Latter-day Saints can- 
not do without. 

A few days ago I received an order from a loan company to pre- 
pare a supplemental abstract, dated from the time that a certain mort- 
gage was filed in our county, down to the present time. I knew 
just what that order meant, because I have had a number of them. It 
meant that they were preparing foreclosure proceedings. I got in 
touch with the man before I executed this order and had a long talk 
with him, and he told me of his troubles, misfortune in business, sick- 
ness in his family, and a lot of troubles of that nature. Now, it happens 
that I audit the books of some of the wards of our stake every year, 
and in auditing the tithing books of the ward where this man lived I 
discovered that while he had paid tithing pretty well for a number of 
years, he had neglected that very important law about two or three 
years ago. In other words in 1919 he had appeared on the tithing 
books for the last time ; and when I asked him how much he was in 
arrears with his interest to this loan company he said : "A little over 
two years." "Well, now," I said, "you don't seem to be making very 
good progress do you? What do you think the future holds for you?" 
"Well, I don't know," he'-'said, "I am at a loss to determine whether 
I shall let the loan company take this farm of mine or whether I shall 
attempt to pay anything more on it." I spoke to him then and said : 
"Why did you quit paying tithing two or three years ago ? You see, I 
know your record." "Well," he said, "I did not have the money to 
pay it with." I asked him if he had not had any money at all, if he had 
not ever received any money. "Oh yes," he said, "I have received 
money, but I have had to use part of it for the maintenance of my 
family, and there have been a dozen people hounding me all the time 
for all that I could spare out of it." "Well," I said, "why didn't you 
pay the Lord his one-tenth of that first?" "Well, because the other 
people were right there dunning me for it, and the Lord wasn't." 
"Well now," I said to him, "My brother, there is only one way for you 



42 



GENERAL CONEERENCE 



to get out of this trouble, and I feel safe in promising you that if 
you will begin at this time and pay your tithing, absolutely honestly, 
as you go along, and every time that means or substance come into 
your hands, you will be rejuvenated, you will see your way out, and 
ultimately you will triumph." He said, "I think I will try it." 

My brethren and sisters, I feel entirely safe in making him that 
sort of promise I know that if he is honest with the Lord and pays 
his tithing absolutely honestly, and observes to keep the other laws of 
the gospel as far as he understands them, the Lord will come to 
his help, because "man's extremity is the Lord's opportunity." 

I was talking to a man in this fashion not so long ago and he said : 
"Well it does not look very good for a strong man to repent after he 
has got in debt so far he can't wiggle. It does not look very good for 
him to repent when he is compelled to do it." I said to him : "I think 
it is a whole lot better to repent under pressure than not to repent at 
all." Somebody in England asked me regarding the Manifesto : "Why 
was it that President Woodruff would not receive a revelation con- 
cerning the matter of polygamy and issue that manifesto until the laws 
of the land were bringing such pressure to bear that there was scarcely 
any way out of it?" I answered him in this way: "I don't know of 
any time when a revlation is more needed than just when you do not 
know what to do." And that is the way I feel about these things. 
Brethren, if you have neglected your duty up to this time, and you 
see the light now, and you are inclined to repent and to observe this 
law, I think that I can promise you that the Lord will come to your 
rescue and that you will be delivered from the hands of your enemies 
as yon now regard them — those who are trying to collect money from 
you. I feel a little freer in talking about this matter in the presence 
of my brethren here on the stand than I should do if I were out en- 
tirely on my own responsibility, because if I make some statement here 
that is not wise, or is in error, I can be corrected before my words 
have clone any harm. 

May the Lord bless his people that they may see the necessity of 
rendering more zealous devotion, that they may see that they cannot 
prosper without observing and keeping the laws of the land as made 
known to them. It is a blessing, a privilege, and it is a pleasure to re- 
ceive commandments. One of the things the Lord promised the people 
was that if they would be obedient he would give them commandments 
not a few, and I think that we cannot receive them and disregard them 
and hope to prosper. May the Lord bless us all together, I ask it in 
the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

A letter was read by President Grant from President Heber Q. 
Hale, of the Boise stake of Zion, announcing his regrets at his inability 
to be present at the meeting today

ELDER DAVID R. LANGLOIS 

(President of the Burley Stake of Zion) 

It is a pleasure to be present at this conference. I have enjoyed 
immensely its spirit. I love to work in the Church. I don't remember 
a time in my life when I did not enjoy laboring in the work of the 
Lord. I don't remember a time in my life when I did not have a 
testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Even as a boy, I felt as strong 
in my testimony, with the knowledge that I had, as I do with the added 
knowledge that I have since been able to gain, and I can testify to 
you today that I know that President Grant, and all the brethren 
associated with him, are righteous men, men whom God has called to 
preside over his Church here on the earth, and men whom he is pleased 
to recognize as the directors of his kingdom here on earth. When 
counsel, advice or instruction comes from them, it is for us to receive 
it and act upon it, for it is as if it came from the Lord himself. 

I was much impressed at our conference a year ago by the remarks 
of President Grant in advising our people to raise sugar beets. We 
were so much impressed on that occasion that we went home from 
that conference and did all in our power to get our people to follow the 
advice of the brethren, so that we were successful to quite an extent 
in increasing our acreage of sugar beets, not nearly to the extent that 
we -should have been, but those who heeded the counsel were blessed. 
I was very much impressed by the remarks of one man who is not a 
member of the Church, but when the instructions were given by 
President Grant he said: "I believe that your leaders are looking to 
the interest of your people, and I think that 1 will follow President 
Grant's advice." He planted twenty acres of sugar beets, though he had 
not intended to plant any. I would to God that all of our Saints could 
have that same faith in our leaders. Brethren and sisters, we will 
never go wrong when we follow their advice. 

I had occasion to go to the president of my stake, while living in 
Utah, for advice, on one occasion, and when he gave me the advice 
it was just the opposite from what I wanted, and I want to tell you 
it was a test of my faith to follow his advice. It was when I moved to 
Idaho, and he said : "Go. and the Lord bless you. We have bishops 
of wards and presidents of stakes all over that country. Now you 
go and be one of them." I never dreamed at that time that I would be 
one of them, but through the inspiration that came to him as an officer 
in this Church, he saw the future, and it was not long after that until 
I had an occasion to give advice myself. I was but a boy, young in 
experience in the Church. I was called to preside over a little branch 
of just a few souls in the locality in which I had settled, and a man 
came to me and said: "Brother Langlois, I have come to you for 
advice." And when he said that, it frightened me, to think that I 
would have to give him advice. I feared because he came to me in 
my official capacity. I offered a prayer to the Lord, while he was

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



relating his circumstances, and the vision of that man's future passed 
before my eyes. I saw just what he should do and what would be the 
result if he did as I told him, and I related to him what he should do 
and promised him what the result would be. I also saw what the result 
would be if he disregarded that counsel. I told him that if he did the 
opposite, he would lose all he had in the world. He went home and 
chose to do the very thing that I told him not to do. It was not three 
months until he had lost everything he had in a worldly way, and be- 
cause of that loss his wife became dissatisfied and, taking her chil- 
dren, left him also, so that he had lost everything that he had but the 
clothes he stood in. It was one of the greatest lessons of my life. I 
realized more fully than I had ever realized before, that when we go 
to any of the officers of this Church for advice that it is as if God 
had given it. We should not go unless we expect to follow that 
advice. 

I remember when Elder Ilyrum G. Smith, our Presiding Patri- 
arch, visited our stake. I think it was Elder Smith. lie told our peo- 
ple, though they had lost out, to remain where they were, not to move 
to any other place, that conditions were just as good there as any other 
place, but to get a new footing and stay where they were. One brother 
came to me a day or two after and said: "President Langlois, our 
visitor has upset all my plans. I expected to leave Burley in a very 
short time. I have lost my place, I have nothing here to stay for." 
He said: "What shall I do? Shall I follow his advice and stay here," 
I said : "There is only one answer that I could give, and that is to fol- 
low the advice that has been given, and the Lord will bless you if you 
do." He said : "I will take his advice." He went home, and about 
three or four months later he came back to me and told me how things 
had opened up. He had secured another place on very favorable terms, 
and he was much better off than he had been before the financial crisis 
came. The place he had secured was better than the one he had lost, 
and he did not owe half as much on it as he did on the other place 
when he purchased it. It was another testimony to me that if we will 
follow the advice and counsel of the authorities we will never go wrong. 
May the peace and blessing of the Lord be with us and help us always 
to follow the advice and counsel that are given to us from our breth- 
ren, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

My attention has been called to the fact that seventy years ago 
today the corner stone of the Salt Lake Temple was laid, and that the 
Nauvoo legion was called out under the direction of my father as 
Major-General. 

The choir and congregation sang, "Do what is right." 
Elder Edward H. Anderson, clerk of the Conference, pronounced 
the benediction. 

Conference adjourned until 10 o'clock Saturday morning. 



SECOND DAY 



MORNING SESSION 

President Heber J. Grant presided at the meeting which began at 
10 o'clock a. tru, Saturday, April 7. 

He announced that the choir and congregation would sing, "How 
firm a foundation, ye Saints of the Lord." 

Elder George H. Brimhall, president emeritus of the Brigham 
Young University, offered the opening prayer, after the singing. 

The choir and congregation sang, "Redeemer of Israel, our only 
delight." 

ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 

I have rejoiced, my brethren and sisters, in the thrilling and re- 
markable testimonies that have been borne during this conference. My 
testimony has been strengthened. I shall go out with food for reflec- 
tion for the next six months and longer, and feel to rejoice that I had 
the privilege of hearing the address of our President and the testi- 
monies that have been borne at the two meetings that we have had of 
our conference. 

HAPPY IN THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE GOSPEL 

I am always happy to bear my testimony, even though it has to be 
done under the difficult sense of responsibility that rests upon every 
person who attempts to address the great gathering in this tabernacle 
on these great occasions. I do know that this is the gospel of Jesus 
Christ. I bear witness to the truth of the testimonies that have already 
been borne, and wish to add that there is no greater joy in my life 
than that which conies to me because of this great and abounding 
knowledge. 

THE "MORMON" INSTITUTION WORKS 

Many thoughts have gone through my mind, as through yours, 
during the two previous sessions of our conference. I have been re- 
minded especially of a remark made to me just a week ago today when 
I happened to be at Jerome. Idaho, in the company of a number of peo- 
ple who were not of our faith. One man, a prominent man in the 
county, said to me: "The enemies of 'Mormonism' may say many 
things about your faith, but is seems to me that there is one 
thing that we can all say in behalf of the 'Mormon' people and the 
'Mormon' institution, — that it works ; it works successfully in behalf 



46 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



of mankind. It achieves and has achieved that which it sets out to 
achieve." This remark made me think seriously about a good many 
things pertaining to the gospel, for it seems to me that there is no 
higher test of truth than that an organization succeeds in doing 
that for which men establish it or hold it in honor. In fact, I 
believe one of the great modern philosophies is based entirely upon 
I he principle that if a thing works in behalf of its cause, if a sys- 
tem is successful in, achieving the purposes proposed, there must 
be a large element of truth in that system and in such attempts. So 
one of the proofs of the truth of "Mormonism'' lies in the fact that 
during the long period of its existence, approaching a hundred years, it 
has successfully been able to bring peace, happiness, joy and satisfac- 
tion into human lives, into the lives of those who have partaken of its 
blessings. 

A SURVEY OF OUR EDUCATIONAL CONDITIONS 

This question of "workability" came to my mind yesterday when our 
President gave a number of statistics pertaining to the present condi- 
tion of the Church. Most of my time during the last few months has 
been given over to educational work in connection with the Church 
school system. When the President gave the figures as to the number 
of Latter-day Saints attending college, high .school and elementary school 
I was reminded of the comparative value of those figures as another 
evidence of how successfully "Mormonism" works in behalf of its peo- 
ple. According to the figures given by President Grant yesterday, we 
have in this Church 8.6 young people attending college out of every 
thousand members of the Church; whereas, in the whole United States 
there are onlv 4.9 per thousand of population attending college. In 
this Church we have nearly twice as many college students per capita 
as in the country at large. T was interested also in the high school 
figures. Accord'ng to the figures given us yesterday, there are 60.6 
individuals per thousand attending high school in this Church ; whereas, 
in the United States as a wdiole, there are only 20.8. That is. nearly 
three times as many young people are attending h' gh school in the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Patter-day Saints as are attending high 
school, on the average, in this great land of ours. In the elementary 
schools, the difference is not so great, for in our Church there are 
223.3 students out of each thousand of membership, attending the ele- 
men'ary schools, as against 204 in the country at large. Nevertheless, 
this is also a substantial increase, though not so great, because of the 
fact that elementary education is usually required by law in the states 
of the Union; but as soon as the h ; gh school and the college periods 
are reached, where men's free agency above and beyond the obliga- 
tions of the law is manifested, then at once this great Church leaps 
forward far beyond the average of the people of this country. T have 
no doubt that there may be other communities in the United States 
with probably nearly as high a college and high school attendance, but I 



ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 



47 



doubt whether any survey that may he made will show a higher attend- 
ance of college and high school students. 

I call your attention to this not merely because of the inter- 
est it always awakens in us to find that we are standing high in the 
desirable activities of the world, but because it shows how "Mormonism" 
functions in the life of humanity, how thoroughly it works. Edu- 
cation is placed as one of the great and foremost activities of a civilized 
world ; and here a despised, and sometimes more than despised people, 
makes a survey of its educational conditions and finds that the spirit 
of education is stronger within this group of people than in any other, 
perhaps, throughout the country, ar.d stronger than the average within 
the country as a whole. Another evidence, another test of the truth of 
"Mormonism." 

CAUSES OF THE VITALITY OF "MORMONISM" 

Many people have asked how it is that "Mormonism'' so func- 
tions ; how it is able to work in such a fashion in behalf of hu- 
manity; because I might take anything else, any other activity, sound 
and good and designed for the welfare of the human race, and show 
practically the same cond'tions that apply to the course and the cause 
of education. One man will declare that the reason why these 
things are so in "Mormonism" is merely because by some accidental 
condition, great men have arisen in "Mormondom." Joseph 
Smith was a tremendously great character: every student, whether 
of our people or not. will admit the greatness of the man. And so, 
those who do not understand us will say we had a great man to 
found our Church and that explains how we are able to show a con- 
dition so favorable. Another will say that P>righam Young was such 
a great man. And so, as I read recently in. a book not long since pub- 
lished, all "Mormon'snY' may be explained because of the great men 
that "Mormonism" has had. Another book declares that the reason 
why this test of truth, this test of fitness to human conditions, meas- 
ures up as well as it does, is because "Mormonism" has been placed 
under very difficult conditions. It had to fight its way in Missouri. 
It had to fight its way out here in the desert. It has been opposed by 
men, and as a consequence it has been able, through opposition, to 
develop into the great institution that it is today. 

Any such explanation, my brethren and sisters, is insufficient to 
those of us who have understood the spirit of the remarks that have 
been made at ibis conference. There are in this Church great funda- 
mental principles, and reflected from those principles are great fun- 
damental practices. The possession of these principles, the use of these 
practices, lie at the foundation of any explanation of the vitality and the 
strength and the fitness of "Mormonism" to serve the human race; 
and that is my testimony to you, as I understand this great gospel of 
Jesus Christ.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



SOME GREAT PRACTICES AND PRINCIPLES 

President Grant spoke of some of these great practices, in his 
address yesterday. He called our attention to the soil, to the home, 
to the advantage of placing the family unit in the open country, to deal 
with nature and the problems of the soil, and he laid it down to all of 
us who care to follow him, as a fundamental practice in the build- 
ing of this Church. This Church cannot get very far along unless 
it does adhere to these fundamental principles and practices, such as 
were outlined to us yesterday. As to the soil and its products and 
life on the soil and life under the open sky, and the life of contest, 
not with men so much as with nature, with the soil, with the water we 
put on the soil, with the air, the sunshine, and with the various condi- 
tions of agriculture ; out of such contacts and out of such contests comes 
the great strength that we need in the building of our world. "Mor- 
monism" is full of just such principles and such practices. The 
safe road is to be trodden by those who understand these practices, 
who attempt to live them, and to use them in their daily lives as eternal 
reflections of fundamental principles of the gospel. 

I bear you my testimony that it is easy, if one will but humble 
himself and keep near to God in prayer and in service, to understand 
these great fundamental world-shaping principles of' the gospel of Jesus 
Christ, and almost as easy to practice them. 

A GREAT REBUKE OF DOUBT 

Today and yesterday have seemed to me, in this tabernacle, to be 
a great rebuke of doubt. I am speaking just now before one of the 
amplifiers, and if I am speaking into this concave device properly. 
I imagine that my voice is carried much better than it ordinarily 
is, into the remote parts of this building, and possibly into the As- 
sembly Hall. It is a tremendous advance, a tremendous rebuke to 
those of my day, unbelievers in God, who have said to me: "What 
is the use of praying? God cannot hear. Your voice merely stirs waves 
in the air, and God is so far away that the waves disappear and can- 
not reach Divinity. You are wasting your time." Yet today we have 
these great amplifiers under the stand, that T looked at yesterday, 
by which these waves are taken out of the air, thrown into some other 
medium, and carried on again into the air until the voice is spread 
'broadcast over the earth, if we so desire. I know, my brethren 
and sisters, that the main concern of man is to make of himself, by 
righteous living and by proper attempt, day by day, by doing that which 
he knows to be right, a great amplifier by which he may understand 
the whisperings of the Holy Spirit of God. I pray that every one of 
us may be given such strength, may be given such will and such 
opportunity as to make ourselves clear instruments for the discovery 
of the great truth that God has in store for all of us ; and I bear you 
again my testimony that this is the truth, in the name of the Lord 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER WILLIAM H. MENDENHALL 49 



ELDER WILLIAM H. MENDENHALL 

(President of the Bannock Stake of Zion) 

It seems to me, my brethren and sisters, that the President proceeds 
on the theory, "If at first you don't succeed, try, try again." It was 
not my privilege to be present at the conference meetings yesterday. 
Some of my friends have told me that the first day of conference I 
was called for twice. 

I rejoice in being present at this conference. I endorse all that 
has been said. I endorse the remarks, the instructions, and the dis- 
course of the President of the Church yesterday, while I d5,d not 
have the privilege of hearing them. For twenty years I have been 
connected with the presiding authorities of this Church, acting in the 
capacity of one of the presidency of the Bannock stake of Zion, and 
in those twenty years I have learned that the presiding authorities 
in this Church are men of God. who are inspired of the Lord to direct 
its affairs in all the world. And so I have no hesitancy, while I did not 
hear the brethren, in declaring to you that what they said was the word 
of the Lord unto this people. 

I represent twenty-five hundred Latter-day Saints in the south- 
eastern part of Idaho known as the Bannock stake of Zion. Ours is a 
farming and stock-raising community. While during these few years 
of hard times our people have been severely "strapped" financially, some 
of them, yet they maintain the faith of the gospel, a desire to serve the 
Lord and to keep his commandments ; and I believe, in the main, the 
people of our stake have endeavored to carry out the instructions that 
have come to them from the general authorities of the Church in the 
years past — to keep out of debt ; and therefore, I feel that the people 
of Bannock stake will eventually survive this financial difficulty and 
things will be normal again. 

In the beginning of the organization of this Church, Joseph Smith, 
Sr., the father of the Prophet, accepting the testimony and the mission 
of Jesus Christ, inquired what he might do to further the work. The 
Lord, through the instrumentality of the Prophet, gave the revelation 
contained in the fourth section of the Doctrine and Covenants, be- 
ginning with this sentence : "Now behold, a marvelous work is about 
to come forth among the children of men." Dr. Widtsoe, in his dis- 
course this morning, has pointed out to us some of the marvels of this 
great latter-day work as it pertains to education, the training of the 
youth of Zion, and the establishment of truth and righteousness, in- 
formation and knowledge in the hearts of the young people of the 
Church. 

The Lord further says : "O ye that embark in the service of God, 
see that ye serve him with all your heart, might, mind and strength, 
(hat ye may stand blameless before God at the last day." 

I believe, my brethren and sisters, that this revelation applies to 
us. The Lord requires that we shall give our whole soul, our whole ef- 



50 



GENERAL CONEERENCE 



fort and our energy, for the development and growth and the spread 
of this work in the earth among the children of men. 

i 
l 

"Therefore," lie says, "if ye have desires to serve God ye are called to 
the work; 

"For behold the field is white already to harvest; and lo, he that thrust- 
eth in his sickle with his might the same layeth up in store that he perish 
not, but bringeth salvation to his soul." 

Then he goes on to enumerate the qualifications that men should 
possess who are called upon to labor and to minister in this Church : — 

"And faith, hope, charity and love, with an eye single to the glory of 
God, qualify him for the work. 

"Remember faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, brotherly kind- 
ness, godliness, charity, humility, diligence. 

"Ask and ye shall receive ; knock, and it shall be opened unto you." 

My brethren and sisters, I commend this revelation of the Lord 
1o the Latter-day Saints everywhere. Let us read it. Let us study it. 
Let us become acquainted with it, that we may be equal to the duties 
and obligations that devolve upon us from time to time in the de- 
velopment and growth and onward progress of this great and marvel- 
ous work of the Lord. . 

1 bear you my testimony, my brethren and sisters, that I know 
the gospel is true. I know that God lives and that Jesus is the Christ. 
I know that the President of tins Church, President Heber J. Grant, 
has been called by inspiration lo lead this people, and direct the af- 
fairs of this work, and that his counselors and the quorum of the apos- 
tles and the brethren who constitute the general authorities of the 
Church are endowed w'th power from on high, and have the ngt t 
to give to the members of this Church counsel, advice, instruction, rev- 
elation and admonition for the upbuilding and the strengthening of the 
s'akes of Zion and the people everywhere. May the Lord bless us, 
help us to do our duty and serve him and keep his commandments, I 
pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH E. CARDON 

(President of the Cache Stake of Zion) 

1 rejoice, my brethren and sisters, in the spirit of this conference, 
and I feel that its influence will be felt throughout all the stakes of 
Zion. 

This is a glorious work in which we are engaged, and the many 
opportunities that come to us from time to time should qualify us for 
the great work that rests upon us as Latter-day Saints. I am often 
asked, as no doubt many of you are: "What is the best news?" And 
my answer invariably is: "Zion is grow'ng." I cannot give any better 
news than this truth ; and I believe my statement is verified in the sta- 



ELDER JOSEPH E. CARDON 



51 



tistics which were read yesterday by our President. I believe that this 
work will continue to grow and increase in the earth until it shall have 
filled its glorious destiny. I believe that today its influence and power 
is being felt throughout all the civilized nations of the earth. The 
Lord is raising up great men and women not of our faith who are do- 
ing much in spreading the glad tidings of great joy, by bringing down 
the prejudice of the peoples of the world ; and i am grateful to say 
that never before in the history of this people was there a better feel- 
ing among the children of men than at the present time. I believe 
that this condition will continue to grow, for the light which came into 
the world over a hundred years ago has constantly increased and it 
will do so until its power and its influence shall be felt among the na- 
tions of the earth. 

I regret to say, however, that there seems to be a tendency on the 
part of the Christian believing peoples in the world to discredit the 
divine and holy mission of our blessed Redeemer, and we should be 
all the more constantly engaged in bearing our testimonies to the peo- 
ple of his divine and glorious mission. We know that he is the Son 
of God, the Redeemer of the world, and that it is his mission to re- 
deem the world from the Fall, and to bring us back into the presence 
of God, our eternal Father. 

The world sat in darkness prior to the coming of the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, and his testimony to the world has constantly grown 
until thousands and hundreds of thousands of people can testify, as he 
testified, that they know that Jesus Christ, is the Redeemer of the 
world. The Holy Spirit, the Holy Ghost, has borne witness to our 
souls that this is the condition, that this is the truth, and I hope that 
this truth will never diminish in the; hearts of the Latter-day 
Saints. It is my desire that we shall continue to bear this testimony unto 
the peoples of the world until they, too, shall be brought to a knowl- 
edge of the truth. This testimony came to this boy prophet when he 
went and prayed unto the Lord to show him which of all the religious 
denominations then extant in the world was the right one ; and as he 
went and bowed humbly before his heavenly Father, the glorious vision 
that we have been so imbued with all our lives was presented unto 
him, and the Father and the Son appeared unto this young boy; and 
the One pointing to the Other, said : "This is my beloved Son. _Hear 
him." And then this young boy carrie i on a conversation with these 
heavenly Beings, and again there was revealed unto the children of 
men the divine truth of the existence of the Father and the Son 
and the divine truth of their personality. As we entered into the waters 
of baptism and had hands laid upon us for the gift of the Holy Ghbst, 
in the own due time of the Lord, we also were able to testify unto the 
world that we know that Cod lives and that Jesus Christ is the Re- 
deemer of the world. We have been given that testimony, not by flesh 
and blood, notwithstanding the devotion and the faith of our parents, 
but this truth was given unto us by the revelation of Almighty God 



52 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



through the testimony and witness of the Spirit, who is the witness of 
the Father and the Son unto the children of men. I am grateful today 
that 1 can bear to you, my brethren and sisters, this testimony, for I 
do know: that God lives and that he is overruling for good the destinies 
of the children of men, and the events that are transpiring in the 
world today for the consummation of his glorious purposes. I know 
that Jesus Christ is in very deed the Only Begotten Son of the Father, 
and that his mission is divine among the children of men ; and it is my 
desire that this testimony may increase in my soul all the days of my life 
and that the Latter-day Saints will never allow to creep into their 
hearts the spirit that is being manifested today among some of the 
peoples of the world that Christ was not a divine character, that his 
mission is not divine ; notwithstanding that, they will testify that he was 
one of the great characters of the history of the world. 

I know that Joseph Smith was a prophet of the true and the living 
God, and that his mission in the world is being felt for good among 
the children of men. I pray that the spirit of this mission may con- 
tinue to grow in the world until the people of the world may have a 
similar testimony to our own. I know that his successors in the presi- 
dency of this Church are prophets of the true and the living God, and 
that they have directed the affairs of this Church as the Lord would 
have them do ; and they have been sustained in their high and holy 
callings by the masses of the Latter-day Saints ; and I believe that today 
a splendid condition exists among the Latter-day Saints. While there 
is much room for improvement, yet the people's faith is growing and 
increasing in the stakes of Zion. I pray that this may continue 
to grow until we shall be able to accomplish the high and holy call- 
ings to which we have been called, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

A solo entitled, "The Voice in the Wilderness" was sung by Sis- 
ter R. G. Clark. 

ELDER ARTHUR W. HORSLEY 

{President of the Carbon Stake of Zion) 

I am very grateful, my brethren and sisters, for the opportunity 
I have in attending this conference. I, like many others who have 
spoken during this conference, have been coming to conference for 
over thirty years. I was just reflecting upon the past, and I believe 
I am safe in saying that I have not missed a semi-annual or an an- 
nual conference for twenty-five years. I did not expect to enjoy the 
privilege that I enjoy at the present time, and I believe I can go home 
and safely say to the people that this has been one of the best confer- 
ences that I have ever attended, and when they ask me who spoke, I 
can say : "I was one of them." 

I am very grateful to my heavenly Father that the gospel was 
carried to my native land, and that my grandparents and my parents 



ELDER ARTHUR IV. HORSLEY

accepted of it, and that they were among that class which Christ spoke 
of when he said: "My sheep know my voice, and a stranger they 
will not follow." I am very grateful that I have a name and stand- 
ing in this Church, and that I am, thus far, in harmony with the 
authorities thereof and in tune with the body of the Church. I am 
grateful for the blessings we enjoy at home and abroad, and I am 
grateful for the opportunities we have in life. 

I have the honor of presiding over the blackest stake in the 
Church, the Carbon stake, in which, when the mines are operating, 
about 15,000 tons of coal per day are produced ; and while we are a mixed 
community, having farmers and miners, and those who do not be- 
long to the Church among us, nevertheless, we have one of the 'best 
communities that exists in the Church. We have men who go down 
into the bowels of the earth for a livelihood, giving honest labor for 
that which they receive, and I notice that their hearts are right and their 
blood is red. They are serving the Lord and keeping his command- 
ments. 

I rejoiced when I heard the remarks of President Grant yester- 
day morning, advising the Latter-day Saints to be economical and to 
be saving and not waste their means. It is very good advice for all of 
us, no matter where we live. We are traveling fast nowadays in 
automobiles, and we are living fast, and we purchase things that we 
could get along without. 

I was very much impressed yesterday when I heard President 
Croft speak to us, when he spoke of the faith that is among the Lat- 
ter-day Saints, and how they are healed, even without much medi- 
cine. I thought of the days when we had no medicine nor doctors. I 
thought of the days when the boys and the girls were reared upon the 
farm and were fed bread and milk, cornmeal mush, and milk gravy 
and potatoes, and that was about all, save a few chickens and eggs. 
They were thrifty people, and they were almost appendicitis-proof. 
I believe that what we need to do is to get back to the first principles 
and to use more milk, use more butter, more cheese, and a little common 
sense. I believe that then we will be in tune with the body of the Church 
and we will be benefited financially. 

While speaking of the men who go down into the bowels of the 
earth for a livelihood, I might add that we have many of our young 
men who do this kind of work and save their money. They walk up 
to the bishop, when they get their check, and pay their tithing on the 
entire check, whatever it may be, and they are saving the balance of 
their money to go upon missions and some have done this and are 
doing it, and they are feeling well and are spending their time and 
money in the service of the Lord. I tell you, my brethren and sisters, 
fathers and mothers in Israel — that is one of the greatest blessings that 
can come to parents, to have their boy in the mission-field preaching 
the gospel. We heard yesterday the amount of money that it takes to 
preach the gospel, but I tell you that the dividend is worth living for. 



54 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

I 

In my travels from place to place and visiting in the homes of the 
Saints and among those who have fathers or sons upon missions, I 
have the opportunity of reading many of their letters. It seems to me 
that the boys write more to mother than they do to any one else of the 
family. And the mother takes delight in bringing out the letter and 
showing it and having you read it and see what the .boy is doing and 
what he is saying. 

I was forcibly struck with one letter that I read, wherein the boy 
was out preaching the gospel wi'hout purse or scrip, down in New 
Jersey — Campden and Plainfield, in that part of the country. He said 
they could get no shelter ; they had no breakfast ; they had no dinner, 
no supper. They had slept in a little barn. They had been turned 
away forty times during the day and evening when they were can- 
vassing. The people would telephone from one place to another "The 
'Mormons' are in town." He said : "We had nothing to eat. We 
were getting desperately hungry, and all we had was a Book of Mor- 
mon or two to sell and we could not sell them. What could we do?" 
Said he, "We decided to go to one side and pray to God. We had 
read in the scriptures where it says 'the laborer is worthy of his hire.' " 
So they prayed unto the Lord. And the boy said : "After we had got 
up and prayed that morning, we went a short distance, where we met 
a little man who could not speak the English language." By the way, 
he was a German. lie had a little boy by his side, and through the 
boy he talked, the boy acting as interpreter. This man said to these 
two young "Mormon" elders: "Come with me; I want to speak to 
you. Come to my home, I want to feed you and I want to give you a 
place to rest." So they went and enjoyed the hospitality of the good 
man. And in the letter the boy said: "Mother, I know God heard our 
prayers." 

There is the dividend that comes to the Latter-day Saints — when 
they get a dividend of that kind, when the boy writes home and says : 
"Mother, I know God heard my prayers." He doesn't get that testi- 
mony with a pocket full of money. He doesn't get that testimony 
working around. No, but when he is so humble that he has to go to 
God, his eternal Lather and seek relief and depend upon him ; then it 
is that he gets a testimony of the gospel. So, the boys who go upon 
these missions are not only beneficiar'es to those who are in the world, 
but they are beneficiaries to themselves and to their posterity ; and I 
know that we cannot spend any money to any better advantage than 
to spend it for the boys going upon missions, and going to the Church 
schools, where they can learn and be taught the principles of life and 
salvation. I do not expect to die a rich man. I would rather spend 
every dollar I have in giving the boy or the girl a reasonable educa- 
tion and helping them to fulfil missions in the nations of the earth. 
That is the way I feel about it. 

I am always pleased when I hear the .brethren bearing testimony 
of the goodness of the Lord to them, and that the power of God is 



ELDER ARTHUR W. HORSLEY

in the earth today, and that the sick are healed. I am glad for these 
thing's, because I have received the blessings under the hands of the 
servants of the Lord myself, and I tell you I have faith in the gospel, 
or I would not be here. I am not ashamed of the gospel, because I 
know it is the power of God unto salvation. I am satisfied, and I am 
• satisfied if the Lord will help me, to remain the rest of my days if pos- 
sible with the body of the Church, that I may be able to listen to the 
dictations of the Holy Spirit that are given to us from time to time. 
I want to bear you my testimony that no man can get up and truth- 
fully say that, by taking counsel from the authorities of the Church, 
he has ever lost anything. I have faith in the authorities of this 
Church. I have faith in them that when they tell me to plant beets I 
plant beets, and I do not plant potatoes. I have faith in them 
(hat when they tell me to go to some place I am willing to go. 
That is why I went to Price, where I live, because I was told to go 
there by President Day, who at that time was the President of the 
Parowan stake of Zion. He said : "Go there and stay and grow with 
the community." I took his advice and I have never regretted it, and 
I have never felt as if I wanted to go away from that locality, because 
I am where the servant of the Lord said for me to go, and that is 
where we should be. 

My brethren and sisters, we have prophets, seers and revela- 
tor.s in the Church today, and I am always willing to listen to the living 
oracles of God. 

I hear my testimony to you that I know that God lives and hears 
and answers the prayers of this people. I know that the brethren, 
down to the last ordained as prophets, seers and revelators, in this 
Church, are ordained of God. I know that President Grant is the right 
man in the right place. It was made known to me when he was sus- 
tained as the President of this Church. I saw in him when he arose 
in the pulpit, the likeness of the late Joseph F. Smith, and I won- 
dered and I looked and thought perhaps my eyes had deceived me, un- 
til the next day when a brother stood up in the stand, who was going 
to Scandinavia to preside over the mission, and he testified to the very 
same thing that I saw myself, and he verified it. I thank the Lord that 
I am here at this conference. May the Lord bless my brethren and 
sisters in all their labors whether it be at home or abroad, is my prayer 
for us all, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 

A very wise man once said : "You cannot judge the full value 
of the teachings of any man by merely hearing the message. You must 
wait until you see the result of those teachings as they are carried 
out in the lives of the men and women who accept them and live them." 
The world now is having an opportunity to judge the teachings of 



56 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



the Prophet Joseph Smith, by examining the lives of the Latter-day 
Saints. 

A TESTING TIME 

I am sure that it is also true that the world is full of theory. All 
kinds of theories are advanced by men who have in their hearts a 
desire to solve the problems of the world, and think they are going to 
do it. At the same time, I am sure that this is a testing time, when 
everything will be shaken that can be shaken and when nothing shall 
stand except that which God has established and that which is the 
truth. I am not afraid, so far as the Church is concerned, as we enter 
this great conflict. As the testing time approaches I have no fear, be- 
cause the Lord himself has decreed that this work shall stand. To 
Daniel he made it known. Daniel saw our day, and this work, that it 
should roll forth until it should fill the whole earth, and that it should 
not be thrown down nor be left to another people. I have absolute 
confidence, therefore, in the outcome of this work and the fulfilment 
of that promise. At the same time, to those who have not this faith, 
we have an appeal to make, — to judge the work by its fruits, by the 
results that have been obtained from the teachings of the leaders of this 
Church. 

THE RELIGION THAT IS WORTH HAVING 

I was impressed recently by reading a work written by one of the 
eminent gentlemen of this country, Thomas Nixon Carver, who, a 
year ago, addressed the conference in this great tabernacle. He was 
discussing in his book the kind of religion that is worth having and 
the kind that will survive, and from some of the interesting things 
I noted, I wish to read the following extracts. Said he : 

"The religion which best fits men for the struggle with the forces 
of the world, which enables them to survive in this struggle, will event- 
ually be left in possession of the world." 

Again another : 

"That nation or that people whose average individual character and 
conduct and whose social institutions and customs are such as to make 
them strong in competition with other peoples, and able to spread over 
the earth and subdue it and have dominion over it, become by that very 
fact the chosen people, whatever their name, language or religion." 

Still another: 

"The church which ministers to a neighborhood where poor people 
live, that gives them a discipline which enables them to rise out of pov- 
erty and pass them on to other neighborhoods, to make room for other 
poor people who are coming in and by repeating this process, continue to 
minister to the needs of poor people, but of an ever-changing body of poor 
people, is the only kind of a poor man's church to be proud of." 

And I am proud of this Church, though it is a poor man's Church. 



I 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 57 

At least the membership of this Church was very largely made up of 
poor men and women, but they did not stay poor, thank the Lord. 
Through adhering to the teachings of this Church, men have come 
into the possession of their own homes, as we heard from our Presi- 
dent yesterday morning, so much so that 75 per cent of the member- 
ship of the Church own their own homes. Perhaps no such record 
can be found anywhere else in the world. These poor people were 
made independent and passed on to take care of themselves, and to ren- 
der assistance to other poor folks who are still coming, that they 
may ultimately become independent. I think I can see working out 
in the process of the Church, the fulfilment of all our dreams, for from 
my childhood I have heard it said that the day would come when this 
people would be the leaders of the world, would be a pattern and ex- 
ample to be sought after by the whole world, and that the world, if 
they would come to success, would imitate the Latter-day Saints. 

THE MARGINS THAT COUNT 

Out in Oregon I was impressed on one occasion by a statement 
of an old forest ranger, who told me that in any group of trees in any 
part of that great forest country, any single tree in that group whose 
height was about six inches above any other tree in the group, would 
become the giant of the group. Just that little margin of difference 
gave that tree its advantage. I say to you, with my friend, that a re- 
ligion that prepares a people to succeed in competition with other 
peoples, to survive, is a religion that will stand and endure. I have 
thought of how the Lord has provided for the material, spiritual and 
physical strength and endurance of the Latter-day Saints. I am calling 
your attention to this, my brethren and sisters, because I do not expect 
to see a great miracle wrought to produce this change. The key, the 
way to attain that end, has already been given to us in the very com- 
mon and practical things that we hear from day to day. 

THE WORD OF WISDOM 

I want the Latter-day Saints to have faith in these revelations. 
Take, for instance, the Word of Wisdom. The Lord himself said that 
it was given for the temporal salvation of the Latter-day Saints. It 
has to do with the making of a strong body. We have heard something 
about the death rate in the Church— among the lowest of any group of 
people in the world. We have heard how that the average length of life 
of a Latter-day Saint is about six years longer than the average length 
of life in the United States. Any community of people whose average 
length of life is six years longer than any other group has that margin 
of difference. They will be the leaders. They cannot help but be in 
advance. Any community of people whose average death rate is low 
and whose average birth rate is high, as the Latter-day Saints' death 
rate and birth rate are, cannot help in the end but be in the lead. They 
have the margin of difference and advantage. 



58 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

There has been imported into the United States in the last seven 
years, one billion dollars worth of coffee, according to government sta- 
tistics, and not one dollar of that coffee was raised in the United 
States. How many years would it take the United States government, 
if all the people would contribute what they now pay for coffee into a 
tax, to wipe out the national debt? A billion dollars in seven years — 
it is easily figured out — and yet not one single atom of food value or 
strength or benefit comes to man, but positive hurt and injury, through 
the use of coffee. 

That is only one item. Add tea, and tobacco, also other things 
forbidden in the word of wisdom, and I say to you that if the Lat- 
ter-day Saints would observe this law of the Lord, it would become a 
great factor in their economic salvation and would give them a margin 
of difference over a coffee drinking, tea drinking and tobacco smok- 
ing community that would put them, in the end, head and shoulders, 
physically, mentally and financially, ahead of any other group. 

MINISTRATION TO THE SICK 

I would like to call your attention, since mention has been made 
of it, to another item. We believe in anointing the sick with oil, and 
praying over them. At the same time we are not fanatics. We be- 
lieve in faith and works. We recognize the skill of the physician as 
the wisdom of the Lord, and we are willing to employ it, but to em- 
ploy it in connection with blessings we seek at the hands of the Lord 
in his appointed way. We do not want the Latter-day Samts to forge' 
that there is a privilege they enjoy to seek the Lord for blessings that 
may be had through their faith ; and often, I believe, we could save 
ourselves expense and sickness and trouble if we would exercise our 
faith a little more. Not that I would ban the usel of medicine, properly 
applied, nor the skill of the physician, but we do not want to forget 
what the Lord has offered to us ; and if it were computed — all that has 
been saved through the ministration on the part of the elders in the 
Church in relieving the sick, in saving them and in saving those who 
would naturally have to pay the bill if physicians had to do the work 
to bring to pass the restoration to health— it would amount to a tre- 
mendous sum, not to say anything of the relief to sufferers. That 
principle alone would put the Latter-day Saints head and shoulders 
above any other community. 

PAYMENT OF TITHING 

Again; here is the principle of tithing — a principle that contains 
the key for the solution of the financial struggle that is going on in 
the world between capital and labor. It is but the beginning perhaps 
of that system or plan which our heavenly Father has given for the 
solut'on of this problem, but I bear witness to you that the Latter-day 
Saints, if they will pay their honest tithing, will be enabled thereby to 
produce the state and condition that will enable the Church, as a whole 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 



59 



body, to take care, not only of their poor, but to take care of their fi- 
nancial problems. By the payment of tithing-, a great industry, we 
have heard, was saved. I bear witness to you that if that industry, 
the sugar company, had not been saved, it would have been the great- 
est calamity financially that has ever happened to this inter-mountain 
country, and we would not have recovered from it for many years. 
Thank the Lord some Latter-day Saints paid their honest tithing and 
there was means in the hands of the Church to stabilize industries of 
this kind that affected so many of our people. If all the Latter-day 
Saints would pay their tithing the financial strength of this people 
would never be imperiled no matter what might come. 

FAST OFFERINGS AND FASTING 

Again, I call your attention to the fact that the Lord has pro- 
vided for the Latter-day Saints a way to take care of their poor, which 
does not cost them a dollar. The poor the world will always have' 
with them and the poor they will always have to take care of. By 
the provision which he has given wherein we abstain from the use 
of two meals on the first Sunday in the month, we obtain physical 
benefits and blessings from that sacrifice, and at the same time we save 
something, the equivalent of which Latter-day Saints should give to 
the bishop to take care of the poor of the Church ; and if that were done 
by the Latter-day Saints, so much so that each member of the Church 
would contribute an average of ten cents for those two meals, of five 
cents per meal, there would be ample funds, without touching the tithes 
of the Church, to take care of all the poor and it would not cost anybody 
a dollar and those who have sacrificed the use of a meal have ob- 
tained a benefit. 

I bear witness to you that this is a time when men are being 
tested as to whether or not they are going to have power over the 
flesh to resist the temptations of the evil one. There is an eternal 
conflict on — the conflict between the flesh and the spirit. I think it 
is a splendid thing for each and every one of us to ascertain who is 
boss and master in the house in which we live. Does the flesh have 
its way? I am grateful that once a month there is an opportunity 
for every Latter-day Saint to demonstrate this thing. I know that 
when you come to that fasting period, the flesh will begin to say: "I 
cannot fast ; I will have a headache, or T will get weak in the knees or 
sick," or something else. Does the flesh have its way? If so, you are 
becoming subjected to the flesh. It is the time and opportunity for the 
spirit to say : "Yes, I know you perhaps will have a headache and be 
sick and faint, but once a month I will show you I am boss in this 
house. I rule. I will have my way; you cannot have it." It is es- 
sential that the spirit shall have dominion and control over the flesh. 
This is the hour, this is the time when the whole world is giving evi- 
dence of their weakness and inability to sacrifice and to make the flesh 
amenable to their own good common sense, or whether or not they 



60 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



want license and liberty to destroy the flesh through yielding to its 
lusts, to its appetites and to its desires. 

MARRIAGE AND DIVORCE 

And so, my brethren and sisters, with reference to the family. 
When the President read how low the divorce record is in this Church, 
how many of the members of the Church enter into the solemn state 
of matrimony and engage in the rearing of families that make for the 
stabilizing, the perpetuity and endurance of any community, my soul 
rejoiced to know that we have a marriage rate per thousand that is per- 
haps greater than that of any community on earth, and at the same time 
our divorce rate is lower. What is it that is upsetting and disturbing 
the world today? This very identical thing. And, if the Latter-day 
Saints will not only observe this great commandment of the Lord, but 
at the same time honor the first great commandment to multiply and 
replenish the earth, and not yield to the lusts of the flesh, to the 
pleasures, slo-called, selfish pleasures, of life and fail to respond to 
God's great law ; if they will but follow the example set by their fath- 
ers and mothers and fulfil that law and discharge their duty to the 
unborn, giving them the right and the privilege to come with us and 
enjoy earth life; if the Latter-day Saint boys and girls will continue, 
I say, to adhere to that high and sacred and holy obligation, then I 
am as sure as I am that the sun rises that it will come to pass that this 
people will survive no matter what the calamities may be, no matter 
what the perils at home or abroad may be, no matter how the earth 
shall be shaken, how men shall be tried, how nations shall be torn, 
how thrones shall totter, how finances shall go to wreckage, how laws 
shall be defied. If only this people shall adhere to these few simple 
principles which God has given to them, they shall weather the storms 
and they shall become the beacon light, the hope of the world, the salt 
of the earth; which may God grant, I humbly pray in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

! 

ELDER WILLIAM T. JACK 

{President of the Cassia Stake of Zion) 

I have rejoiced very much, my brethren and sisters, in attending 
the sessions of this conference thus far ; and I can say, as was stated by 
one of the brethren yesterday, that I have been fortunate in my life 
in the fact that my heart and my feelings have always been in tune with 
those whom God has chosen to lead his Israel ; and I stand before you 
in that attitude today. I rejoice in the privilege that I have of attend- 
ing these conferences of the Church and of associating with the best 
men that live upon this earth, men whom God has chosen from among 
his people, and has lifted them up to be our leaders, our prophets and 
those to whom we should look for advice and counsel, and those 



ELDER WILLIAM T. JACK 



61 



from whom we should take that counsel and that advice. 

I believe that the third verse of the twelfth chapter of the Book 
of Daniel is applicable to us as Latter-day Saints today. In the eleventh 
chapter he has referred to a great war, and pictures the close of it 
temporarily, and shows that we are approaching the time when the 
dead in Christ shall arise, and he makes this specific mention of the 
Latterday Saints, in my opinion ; he says : 

"And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; 
and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever." 

The world's calamity today, as was stated yesterday, is our oppor- 
tunity. As individual members of this Church, if we are applying our- 
selves to the missionary spirit and labor, if we are doing our duty, if 
we are living our religion, we may be laying up for ourselves treasures 
that some day will make those who do it shine as the stars forever and 
ever. 

I rejoice that we have been able to read the scriptures differently 
from our friends who profess the Christian religion in the world. I 
thought this morning, while sitting here, of the prophecy delivered to 
and made by John the Revelator while he was upon the isle of Patmos, 
banished from his brethren and from his people. We are told that an 
angel came to him and said : "Come up hither, John, and I will show 
you things which must come to pass hereafter," and he took him up 
on to an, eminence and showed him the falling away of the ancient 
church, the decay of the faith of those who were saints and their de- 
struction by the evil power. Then he showed him the period of dark- 
ness through which this world has passed. Then, in the spirit of hope, 
he raises his voice and says : 

"And I saw another angel flying through the midst of heaven, having 
the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to 
every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, 

"Saying with a loud voice, Fear God and give glory to him; for the 
hour of his judgment is come:' and worship him that made heaven, and 
earth, and the sea, and the fountains of water." 

Well, I rejoice, my brethren and sisters, to live in the day of the 
fulfilment of that prediction. I rejoice to know that Joseph Smith was 
raised up and received heavenly visions, as was testified to here today 
by President Cardon. I know that Joseph Smith received the vision 
of the Father and the Son, in the Spring of 1820. I know that he 
received a visit from the angel, Moroni, and that he was blessed with 
visions and with revelations from time to time, and finally with the 
authority of the Priesthood of God. Friends may rail against us for 
believing in divine authority and for looking up to the Priesthood of 
God, but I want to tell you, my brethren and sisters, that is our hope 
in the future, to follow the lead of these men whom God has raised uf> 
and unto whom he has given his Spirit, and to whom he is giving the 
inspiration, the knowledge and the wisdom that should lead Israel and 
will lead Israel. 



62 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



I rejoice in these blessings and in these opportunities. I know 
that the gospel is true. I know that the Lord has spoken, that this is 
his work that he has established upon the earth, never again to be 
overthrown nor given into the hands of another people, but it will 
stand forever; and the only question is: Shall we stand with it? 

I think that those who attended the meetings yesterday and those 
who are here today are among the most faithful in the different parts 
of the Church, because we appreciate the conference; we are glad to be 
present and catch the inspiration of the Lord that falls from the lips 
and through the addresses of men who are called to lead this work. I 
rejoice in the fact that there are so many who are faithful among the 
Latter-day Saints — men and women upon whom rests the responsibil- 
ity of carrying on this great work through these days and years of 
trouble. 

I know that the admonition and counsel given to the Church a 
year ago, at this conference, from President Grant, was the word of 
the Lord. There were people who doubted it at that time. There 
were people who went home feeling angry that the President of the 
Church should assume to dictate to them or to suggest to them what 
they ought to do in their own affairs, but the great majority of them 
did not feel that way. We knew that it was the word of the Lord and 
it required less than a year to demonstrate the fact that that was true. 
So I believe that the words of Daniel will apply to us also in this day, 
that if we are wise, wise enough to catch the inspiration, to take the 
word of those who preside over us, the time will come, within, per- 
haps, the next ten years, when the financial world is crashing and is 
coming down to the same condition that many of the members are 
in at the present time, that we will be. able to shine with the brightness 
of the firmament, as men of wisdom, men who have taken counsel, men 
who have been guided thereby in their financial affairs. 

May the Lord bless us, my brethren and sisters. May the inspira- 
tion of his Spirit continue to rest down abundantly upon President 
Grant — and upon his counselors, and upon these chosen men — the 
Council of the Twelve — men after God's own heart. I thought last 
night, while listening to Dr. Talmage referring to the general author- 
ities of the Church — twenty-six men — that their equal could not be 
found among all the peoples of the earth. There are no such men out- 
side of the -Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, upon whom 
the Lord has placed his power, into whose hands he has given his 
authority, and to whom he looks for the safeguarding of the good ship 
Zkn, through the breakers around about us. 

May peace rest down upon you, my brethren and sisters, and the 
inspiration of the Lord be with you in your homes. May you be suc- 
cessful in the rearing of your families, in the conduct of your affairs, 
and in your dut'es and obligations to God and to your brethren and 
sisters, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

ELDER B. H. ROBERTS 

(Of the First Council of Seventy and President of the Eastern States 

Mission) 

On the title page of the Book of Mormon there is a statement made 
of the purpose for which the book was written. Part of the explanation 
is as follows : 

" — Which is to show unto the remnant of the House of Tsrael what great 
things the Lord hath done for their fathers ; and that they may know the 
covenants of the Lord, that they are not cast off forever; and also to the 
convincing of the Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ, the Eternal God, 
manifesting himself unto all nations — " 

That book was published in the Spring of 1830. At that time, I 
feel very sure in saying, the conviction of those who considered them- 
selves Christians, was practically unanimous in the conception that 
Jesus Christ, in some way, was divine; and not only divine, but also 
in .some way, the manifestation of God to the world. And ye': we find 
in this preface of the l!ook of Mormon a statement that this book had 
been written and preserved to come forth in the last days to establish 
the conception of jesus Christ as "The Eternal God;" and many 
marvel, doubtless, that such a statement as this should be made. 

What more witness or testimony could the world need than is to 
be found in the New Testament scriptures, to the fact that Jesus is 
the Christ and God? Yiou doubtless will recall the question that Christ 
asked the Pharisees with whom he had been in controversy. Turning 
questioner himself, he said to them: "What think ye of Christ?" — 
having in mind the Anointed One whom the whole nation of Jews 
were expecting — "Whose son is he?" And they quite readily an- 
swered: "The son of David." "How then," said, the Christ, "doth 
David in spirit call him Lord, saying, The Lord said unto my Lord, 
Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool ? If 
David then call him Lord, how is he, then, his son, And no man was 
able to answer him a word." 

Then, on another occasion, when in controversy with the Jews, 
the Savior said : "I and my Father are one," and then they took up 
stones to stone him. Jesus answered them: "Many good works have 
I showed you from my Father; for which of those works do' ye stone 
me?" And the Jews answered: "For a good work we stone thee not; 
but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thy- 
self God," and this, of course, was in their view, blasphemy. The 
Savior answered them saying: "Is it not written in your law, I said, 
Ye are gods? If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God 
came, and the scripture cannot be broken ; say ye of him, whom the 
Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; be- 
cause I said, I am the Son of God, If I do not the works of my Father, 
believe me not. But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the

works ; that ye may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in 
him." 

St. John's testimony is to the sajne effect ; namely : 

"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, 
and the Word was God," and it goes on to tell us that, 

"All things were made by him ; and without him was not any 
tiling made that was made." * * * 

"And the Word was' made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we be- 
held his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father) full of 
grace and truth." 

And ,so, you might continue to point out from the New Testament 
scripture how the Christ is proclaimed to be one with the Father, and 
possessed of all power, as he himself declared, both in heaven and in 
earth; and is named in the Holy Trinity as being equal with God, the 
Father, and with God, the Holy Ghost; the three constituting the God- 
head of heaven and of earth. Yet, notwithstanding all these testimonies 
of the New Testament scriptures, God brings forth a new volume of 
scripture, the Book of Mormon, which we are learning to call the 
American scripture, the word of God to the ancient inhabitants of 
this land of America. He brings that forth and points out in it that 
the greatest purpose of all in bringing it into existence and preserving 
it, is to testify to both Jew and Gentile in the last days, that Jesus is 
the Christ, the Eternal God. 

In the eastern states of late, there has arisen a great controversy 
about this very subject — viz, is Jesus Deity? A very noted rector in 
the diocese of New York, Dr. Grant, in January, in one of his Sunday 
services, announced that "Jesus was not Deity," but man. His bishop, 
Bishop William T. Manning, immediately took him to task, pointed 
out that he was out of harmony with the creed of the great Episcopal 
Church, and that he ought either to recant the things he had uttered, 
or else he ought to resign. The doctor declined to resign, though he 
did modify somewhat the positiveness of his statement that Jesus was 
not Deity. In his reply to his bishop, he merely said that he did not 
know of the divinity of Jesus Christ, and believed that the historical 
gospels that best set forth his life, did not attribute to him Deityship. 
It is a kind of drawn battle between the rector and his bishop; but it 
discloses the fact that there were quite as many people in that diocese 
who sided with the rector as against the bishop; and it also disclosed 
the fact that the ministry was about equally divided on the subject, 
This agitation that thus arose, extended throughout all the country, not 
only among Christians but the Jews also have participated in it. And 
the discovery is made, and it is safe to make the statement, that not 
more than one-half of those who bear the name "Christian" do really 
believe in Jesus Christ as Deity. I am very sure that it is the general 
mental attitude toward the Christ, that he is merely the "prophet teacher 
of Nazareth," and not at all God. 

That is as far as I may now lead your reflections upon this sub- 



ELDER B. H. ROBERTS 



65 



ject; but is it not marvelous that a book should be brought forth, about 
one hundred years ago that would carry in it testimony and witness 
for the Deityship of Jesus Christ, when there was no earthly reason 
for believing, when the book was brought forth, that it would have 
any such emergency to meet as we now see rising in the modern, 
Christian world? 

I thank God that he thus anticipated the need of the religious 
world concerning a true knowledge of God ; that he brought forth, 
as from the dust, the testimony of sleeping nations to the great cen- 
tral truth of the Christian religion, the important fact that Jesus Christ 
is indeed God, manifest in the flesh; and has, in our day, more than 
doubled divine testimony, that Jesus, the Christ, is both the Redeemer 
of the world and, under the direction of the Father, the Creator of it 
and the sustaining power of it; also the vital force, that gives life to 
all things; and likewise the intelligence-inspiring power; and above 
all the love-manifested power; the love revealed that God has for all 
the children of men, in which manifested love, we may hope for the 
continuation of effort upon the part of the Divine powers, to bring the 
children of men unto' God. May the Lord grant it, I pray in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang, "Now let us rejoice." 
Elder Joseph A. West offered the closing prayer. 
Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock p. m. 



AFTERNOON SESSION 

The meeting began at 2 o'clock p. m. President Heber J. Grant 
announced that the Provo Tabernacle choir, under the direction of J. 
R. Boshard, would sing, "Hark the glorious dawn." 

After the singing, Elder Joseph H. Dean, of Shelley, Idaho, offered 
the opening prayer. 

The choir sang, "O Holy Father." 

PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAWSON 

My brethren and sisters, I have rejoiced greatly in the spirit of 
this conference. We have listened already to some very fine instruc- 
tions and some pointed testimonies which were faith-promoting. I 
desire that the same good spirit that has actuated the other speakers 
may also be with me. 

THE PRINCIPLE OF REVELATION VITAL 

No more important topic has been touched upon at this confer- 
ence than the principle of revelation, which is vital to the salvation 
of the souls of men. It would be difficult to imagine the true Church 

3 



66 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



of God being upon the earth without the principle of revelation or di- 
rect communication. Holy Writ tells us that the prophets of old 
spoke and wrote as they were moved upon by the Holy Ghost, which 
is the spirit of truth and the spirit of revelation. Many pages of the 
Bible are filled with references to this important subject. Even in the 
very beginning, we learn that God created man in his own image and 
after his likeness, and placed him in the Garden of Eden and spoke 
to him there. We are led to believe that God appeared to him in 
person, and it was only when Adam departed from the commandment 
of God that he was shut out from his presence, and even under those 
trying circumstances, the Lord sent an angel to communicate with Adam 
and to bear testimony to him. Surely that was an important time and 
an important matter. And so it was with others that followed. 

THE CASE OF ABRAHAM 

You will remember, my brethren and sisters, that Abraham, that 
mighty patriarch of old and friend of God. — who was a righteous man 
and a righteous judge — diligently sought after the blessings of the 
fathers and the Priesthood, and he found them ; for it would appear, 
from what he says in respect to this important matter, that the Lord 
appeared to him. Abraham said : 

"And finding there was greater happiness and peace and rest for me, I 
sought for the blessings of the fathers, and the right whereunto I should be 
ordained to administer the same ; having been myself a follower of righteousness, 
desiring also to be one who possessed great knowledge, and to be a greater 
follower of righteousness, and to possess a greater knowledge, and to be a 
father of many nations, a prince of peace, and desiring to receive instructions, 
and to keep the commandments of God. I became a rightful heir, a High 
Priest, holding the right belonging to the fathers. 

"It was conferred upon me from the fathers; it came down from the 
fathers, from the beginning of time, yea, even from the beginning, or before 
the foundations of the earth, to the present time, even the right of the first- 
born, or the first man, who is Adam, our first father, through the fathers, 
unto me." 

And again the Lord spake unto Abraham, and he said : 

"For I am the Lord thy God; I dwell in heaven; the earth is my footstool; 
I stretch my hand over the sea, and it obeys my voice ; I cause the wind 
and the fire to be my chariot ; I say to the mountains — Depart hence — and be- 
hold, they are taken away by a whirlwind, in an instant, suddenly. 

"My name is Jehovah, and I know the end from the beginning; therefore 
my hand shall be over thee. 

"And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee above meas- 
ure, and make thy name great among all nations, and thou shalt be a bless- 
ing unto thy seed after thee that in their hands they shall bear this ministry and 
Priesthood unto all nations * * * " 

"Now, after the Lord had withdrawn from speaking to me, and withdrawn 
his face from me, I said in my heart: Thy servant has sought thee earnestly; 
now I have found thee * * * " 

And so, it appears, that God appeared to Abraham and talked 
with him face to face. Surely this was a great and a gloroius revela- 



PRESIDENT RUDfER CLAW SON 



67 



tion, and Abraham was put in the way of obtaining the Priesthood, — 
divine authority — and great and mighty blessings were conferred upon 
him. ' 

THE LORD ADVISES ISAAC 

And the same is true of his son Isaac. At a time when there was 
famine in the land, Isaac was on the verge of departing and going 
into Egypt, but the Lord advised him to remain in the land, for he 
said: "I will bless thee, and give the land unto thee," and the Lord 
renewed upon Isaac the promises that he had given to Abraham. This 
blessing came to Isaac through revelation. How wonderful! 

THE LORD SPOKE TO JACOB IN A DREAM 

And in the case of Jacob, the third member of that quorum of 
patriarchs, it appears that he had a wonderful dream. He saw in vision 
a ladder reaching from the earth unto heaven, and the angels of God 
descending and ascending upon the ladder; but at the head stood the 
Lord. He saw him with his eyes, and the Lord spoke to him and 
blessed him and put upon him the promises that he had made to 
Abraham and Isaac. And so, through the power of revelation, these 
blessings came to those great patriarchs. 

THE VOICE OF REVELATION TO MOSES 

You will remember, that the voice of revelation came to Moses 
from the burning bush. It was a wonderful manifestation, because 
in that voice there was instruction and a definite command given to 
Moses that he should go down into Egypt and deliver the people out 
of bondage. But, mark you. the Lord went with him. The Lord 
spoke by the mouth of Moses to, Pharaoh, and through the power 
of God, Moses wrought those ten mighty miracles in Egypt, by which 
the Children of Israel were delivered and brought out of bondage. 

But the Lord was near; he did not depart nor desert 
his people; he spoke to them in the wilderness. The voice of rev- 
elation came out from Mount Sina>, even the voice of God to the 
children of Israel — giving them the Ten Commandments, the dec- 
alogue. How wonderful was this great manifestation! How other- 
wise, my brethren and sisters, could the children of Israel have 
received this communication and this great law — a law that is really, 
you might say, sufficient for man's instruction all the days of his 
life. 

THE PROPHETS. SEERS, AND REVELATORS OF OLD 

So we might say of the prophets Isaiah, Ezekiel and Jere 
miah ; they were seers and revelators, and wrote by the power of the 
Holy Ghost. Mighty predictions were made by these prophets, which 
are now in process of fulfilment. 

Amos, the prophet, said: "Surely the Lord God will do noth- 



68 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets." That 
is a most astounding statement. It would appear that the Lord 
will not work among the children of men, and will do nothing ex- 
cept that he will reveal himself concerning these matters to his 
servants, the prophets. Where does that place any man or woman, 
or any people, who claim that the canon of scripture is full and that 
God no more speaks to his people? We know that a veil is drawn 
between the Lord and the children of men, but it is not reasonable to 
suppose that the Being who has given the gospel to his cnildren upon 
the earth, will sit behind the veil there, silent, perfectly silent, and 
decline to speak to his children. The idea is monstrous, it is un- 
reasonable. 

THE CHURCH OF CHRIST BUILT UPON REVELATION 

And so, my brethren and sisters, if the Old Testament has em- 
phasized the principle and power of revelation, it is doubly emphasized 
in the New Testament. You have already heard, at this conference, of an 
interview between the Savior and h's apostles, when he asked them this 
significant question: "'Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?" 
And they said: "Some say thou art John the Baptist; some Elias; 
and others Jeremias, or one of the prophets." "But," said he, "whom 
say ye that I am?" Now, you will remember the answer of Peter, 
how striking, how impressive it was. lie said: "Thou art the Christ, 
the Son of the living God." And Jesus answered and said: "Blessed 
art thou, Simon Barjona, for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto 
thee, but my Father which is in heaven. And I say unto thee, that 
thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my Church ; and the 
gates of hell shall not prevail against it." Some have gone so far as 
to say that the rock he referred to was Peter. Surely, the Lord 
Jesus Christ would not build his Church upon one who was lesser in 
power and lesser in authority than himself. No, it is evident that he 
had reference to revelation. It was the rock of revelation. This is the 
view that we take. This is the doctrine that we promulgate. We 
say : Yes, the Church of Jesus Christ is built upon the rock of revela- 
tion, and everything points to this fact, so far as the Latter-day work 
of God is concerned. 

You know Daniel, speaking of the future, said that in the days of 
these kings, or the latter days, the God of heaven would set up a 
kingdom that should never be thrown down nor given to another people, 
and should stand forever. How did the God of heaven proceed to set 
up that kingdom? By the principle and power of revelation, for it 
seems that the Father and the Son descended from the heavens, in 
answer to the prayer of a boy. They stood before him, and revealing 
themselves, wanted to know what he desired. Now, his question 
was simple and direct and beautiful. He said : I want to know 
which of all the sects of the day is the true church, that I may know 
which one to join. And the Lord said to him that, none of the sects 



PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAW SON 



69 



are true, and that their creeds were an abomination to him, and that 
their professors were teaching for doctrines the commandments of 
men. They had a form of godliness but denied the power thereof. 
Now, mark you, a moment before the youth was confused, he knew not 
which way to turn, a moment later his question was answered and he 
knew perfectly the situation and how to act. All this came about with 
him through the medium of revelation. Without revelation Joseph 
Smith, the boy, and Joseph Smith, the Prophet, would have been per- 
fectly helpless. 

NO GREATER COMMUNICATIONS THAN FOUND IN THE DOCTRINE AND 

COVENANTS 

So, we see this principle operating throughout our Church in 
its beginning. John the Baptist appeared and delivered his power and 
Priesthood, and Peter, James and John appeared and delivered their 
authority — the keys and power which they held — and put them upon 
Joseph Smith, the Prophet. Let me say to you, in attestation of the 
testimony of this people and this Church, we have a book of revela- 
tions, containing the doctrines and teachings of the Church. This 
book represents to us the voice of God, yea the voice of God to his 
servant Joseph Smith and to the people of the Latter-day Saints. 
I maintain that you may search the scriptures, from Genes' s to Rev- 
elation, and you will find no greater communication to the children 
of men than some of the things that are contained in the book of Doc- 
trine and Covenants. Do you not remember that mighty revelation 
called the "Vision of the three glories"? Do you not remember that 
great and mighty revelation on Priesthood? Do you not remember, 
that serious, valuable and most precious revelation pertaining to the 
eternity of the marriage covenant? Could there be any religion, — 
anything greater than the truths set forth in these mighty revelations ? 

POWER AND AUTHORITY OF THE LIVING ORACLES OF GOD 

And, while we have access to these things, to holy writ, to the 
scriptures that have been given, we also are permitted to sit under the 
droppings of the sanctuary and to listen to the vo'ce of the living 
oracles of God, to his prophets, whom he has called to preside over us, 
even President Grant, to whom has been committed the keys of the 
kindgom of heaven, to bind upon earth and it shall be bound in 
heaven, to loose upon eanh and it shall be loosed in heaven, "And 
whomsoever he blesses," God has said, "I will bless ; and whom- 
soever he curses, I will curse." That is the power, that is the 
authority that go with this Priesthood and with this people, and I 
rejoice in it. 

I bear testimony to the truth that Jesus is the Christ, that Joseph 
Smith was his prophet, and that the revelations of God to us will guide 
us and will be instrumental, through our obedience, of bringing sal- 



70 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



vation to us in the kingdom of God. This is my testimony and I bear 
it lin the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER URIAH G. MILLER 

(President of the Cottonwood Stake of Zion) 

Many of the brethren with whom I have had the privilege of being 
associated have known for a considerable time that I have never been 
blessed with a particularly strong physical body. They may have 
wondered a good many times why such was the case. I think I can 
satisfy that curiosity. About twenty-five years ago, ,soon after I returned 
from a mission, the president of the Salt Lake stake — the Salt Lake 
stake at that time included all of Salt Lake county, including Salt Lake 
City — called upon me along with one of my intimate associates, who 
had just returned from a mission, to report from this stand. The shock 
that came to me upon that occasion has stayed with me to the present, 
and if you read tomorrow that something more drastic than that has 
come to me, you may know the reason of it. 

I presume that every president of a stake feels somewhat as do I 
in relation to his particular work, concerned of course about the Church 
in general, but more directly concerned relative to the affairs within 
his own borders, and the responsibilities that are upon him to know 
whether or not he is rightly and justly feeding the sheep within that 
fold; whether or not that, as the president of that corporation, if you 
please, he is managing the affairs of that organization in such a way 
and in such a manner that every one of the stockholders therein, the 
members of the Church, are receiving a goodly dividend because of his 
honest and efficient efforts in the work to- which he has been called. 
Aside from, the fundamental principles of adoption, the truths and 
ordinances that have been required, that give us birth, standing, and 
fellowship in the Church of Christ, my mind, among my own people, 
often runs to the passage of scripture recorded in Matthew, the words 
of Christ, wherein he says : 

"Ye have heard that it hath been said: Thou shalt love thy neighbor, 
and hate thine enemy. 

"But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do 
good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, 
and persecute you; 

"That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven." 

The Apostle Paul took up the trend of that thought in his 
epistle to the Ephesians and said unto them: 

"Be kind one to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, as God 
for Christ's sake hath forgiven you." 

We find the same thought also recorded in the writing of the 
Apostle Peter ; he echoed the same principles in his declaration that we 
find recorded in the second epistle, in which he said : 



ELDER URIAH G. MILLER 71 
"Add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; 

"And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to 
patience godliness; 

"And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness 
charity. 

"For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall 
neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ." 

One of the great thoughts in my ministry among the people aside 
from that to which I have already alluded is whether or not I am able 
to draw these things rightly and properly to their view ; whether we 
proceed from day to day, so that all of us shall be cultivated the more 
thorough 1 / in these principles calculated to lead us more closely together 
here, and give for us in the world to come the best and the brightest 
that God has ever provided for his people. 

I am grateful and thankful for my opportunities and privileges. 
I am grateful and thankful that I am a member of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints. I am grateful for the faith and prayers 
of the people in behalf of those who preside over them. 1 am reminded 
now of a prayer offered in behalf of a president of. a stake, in which a 
good Scandinavian lady arose and said : "Oh, Lord, bless our president 
that he may be honest, from time to time." I pray that the blessings 
Df the Lord may be with one and all, and particularly with the brethren 
who have been chosen to lead this great, mighty, and wonderful organ- 
ization in the world, which I bear my testimony to you is the Church 
and kingdom of God, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

ELDER ALONZO A. HINCKLEY 

(President of the Dcseret Stake of Zion) 

My brethren and sisters, I feel exceedingly timid in standing be- 
fore you, and desire your 'help and sympathy. I sense, I think, at least 
in a measure, the great responsibility that is upon me when I occupy 
your time. Every word that I utter should be guided and inspired by 
the Spirit of the Lord, and it should be pregnant with meaning and with 
good. I pray that it may be. 

As I have sat through the sessions of this conference, facing this 
stand, looking at the brethren, I have felt exceedingly happy. I have 
been all these years up to the present, in this Church, ana 1 am happy 
to say that up to the present I have never looked upon the face of any 
of the general authorities of the Church with any other feeling than 
that of reverence. I believe that this reverential feeling was handed to 
me by my father and mother. In days long since past, when I was a 
boy, having been born at Cove Fort, and my father being sent there 
under the direction of President Brigham Young, and kept that place 
as a stage station, and with all of the visitors that traveled that way 
on that overland route, I remember one hour in the morning and 
one hour, or occasion, in the evening that were sacred to my father; 



72 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



drawing his family away from worldly men and worldy thoughts with 
this one sentence : "Let us go over aside." We knew that that meant 
family prayer. I cannot remember hearing my father pray when he 
did not sustain, in his prayer before the Lord, the general authorities 
of the Church. I remember that it was in my father's prayer that he 
prayed for the President of the United States. He prayed for those 
who carried heavy responsibility. I remember that my father taught 
his children that when you sustain with uplifted hand the brethren, 
as prophets, seers and revelators, you sustain them with your life, 
your works, as well as your prayers ; and I thank the Lord that up to 
the present that spirit has obtained with me. When one of the brethren 
■ — Brother Ballard— was talking this morning about the responsibility 
of rearing a family, I thought then:Jiow grateful I am, as I sit here 
in this vast audience and think of those who call me father, that 
they are as numerous as they are in our household — fourteen such 
having come into our family. 

I express my thanks and gratitude to the Lord for the gospel of 
Jesus Christ and for the influence it has had in my father's family 
and in my family, and I have a prayer in my heart that that influence 
shall go down through the generations. It is a delight to me, in my own 
family, to hear innocent children call upon the Lord to bless President 
Grant, to bless his counselors, the Council of the Twelve, and those who 
bear rule in this Church of the Lord. 

My heart is in accord with all the teachings of this conference. 
I think that I should feel, and I do feel, almost as keenly, perhaps, as 
any of you, the importance of some of the statements that have been 
made during this conference, on account of my connection with the 
producer, my connection with the farmers, the tillers of the soil, as my 
way has led me through this state. Only the other day I stopped in a 
town, a railroad center, where I discovered good men whom I knew. 
We held meeting there and thev came to meeting. I said, "You here?" 

"Yes, I am here, Brother Plinckley." 

"Away from your family?" 

"Yes, away from my family." 

"How can that be, my brother? You have good land and good 
water; why are you here?" 

"Brother Hinckley, so long as it remains as it is now, and the 
prices of my products are as low as they are now, and the workers in 
the various lines of industry can draw the wage that they can draw, I 
must be here to make a livelihood." 

The words of President Grant entered my heart — the encourage- 
ment for us to stand and stay upon the soil, the assurance that better 
times are coming. I stand before you not able to say, as some who 
have stood here, that I do no', owe a soul anything in the world. 
As I sat here and listened to the words of President Grant, 
I wondered just what kind of a feeling that must cause a man to have; 



ELDER A. A. HINCKLEY 



73 



and then I thought of the thousands who could not say it. I went over 
my stake of Zion and I thought back to the promise made by President 
Grant that if we would remain faithful — I think he said his key-note 
speech was : Keep the commandments of God — if we would pay our 
tithes and observe the Word of Wisdom, the Lord would lead 
us out of our troubles. I am following on in faith and believing that 
that promise shall be fulfilled. I hope to pay my tithing and to pay it 
honestly; and I trust the Lord for his part in the fulfilment of the 
promise that he has made. I hope to observe the Word of Wisdom, 
that I may have strength in the navel and marrow to the bone, and be 
able to run and not be weary, and to walk and not faint, and to have 
wisdom given unto me — great treasures of knowledge — that I shall 
know what to do. 

Now, if I could offer anything that would help that farmer who 
is yet upon the soil, who is in the condition that I am in, oh, how happy 
I would be! I do believe this that that farmer ought not to run to 
extremes and plant all in one line : because only a year ago, I remember 
very well, we were wondering what we could do with hay, and hay was 
piled mountain high in many a field, with no price, no value. Hay 
now brings a good price. Now, we talk about running to the extreme 
and having planted too many potatoes. I believe, my brethren and 
sisters, that we have been taught a long time by our agricultural col- 
• . lege, by the extension division, by the agriculturists who represent the 
sugar industries and by the best farmers in the state, to diversify, to 
raise something of all the things we need. I believe it was Bishop 
William B. Preston, who used to say : "I can tell you how to succeed : 
Raise everything you need and a little to sell." I believe that answers 
the question. We ought not to have to bring on to our table that which 
we have to pay out money for. We ought to raise it; we ought to 
have it stored in the cellars and in the store-houses. It ought to be 
of the best quality. We ought to raise that which we have to sell, the 
kind the people want to buy. It ought to be the quality that would 
carry with it repeat orders that would come back to us. I was de- 
lighted when President Grant said what he did about the dairy industry. 
Only the other day I was talking to Brother James M. Kirkham, who 
has been back in Wisconsin, and I will add to what he said, a brief 
statement also from Senator C. L. Funk who had been back in Wiscon- 
sin. I said. Senator Funk, what is the condition in Wisconsin, that 
great dairy state?" 

"Oh," said he, "they are in clover. I never saw greater pros- 
perity." 

James M. Kirkham was back there looking for dairy cows. He 
walked into a great barn and wanted to see what the man fed the 
cows. He was told : "Oh, the basic feed here is alfalfa." 

"Where does it come from?" 

"It comes from Colorado."

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



He looked around and opened a sack, and said, "What is this?" 

"Dried beet pulp." 

"Where does that come from?" 

"That comes from Utah." 

Then he said : "You walk down to a cheese store and when 
you ask him what he has there, he has Wisconsin cheese that you buy." 
Cows fed on Colorado alfalfa and Utah beet pulp, made up into cheese 
back there, shipped out here and bought as Wisconsin cheese. 

Let me give you just one more thought, if I may, and I see that 
I have gone beyond my ten minutes, so I will stop shortly. One cow, 
if she only gives 6,000 pounds of milk, if she only makes three hundred 
pounds of butter fat, and if the butter-fat only brings forty cents 
a pound, will net you $120 for the butter-fat and leave the milk for 
pigs and for chickens ; and that cow will only eat, if you give her 
all she can eat, if she eats nine months in the year out of your hay-stack, 
four and one-half tons of hay. Four and one-half tons of hay 
measured into $120 gives you $26.66 a ton for your hay. She will leave 
there with you several tons of fertilizer. She will keep your. boy at home. 
She will give him a job. She will give you the cheapest and best 
food that you can have, and she will help lift the mortgage. She will 
feed the pigs and they will help lift the mortgage. She will feed 
the chickens and they will help lift the mortgage. She will furnish 
the fertility to put on the beet ground to draw the cash, and they 
will help lift the mortgage. 

Now, brethren, we are invited to stay on the farm. We are 
invited to make it profitable while we stay on the farm. It is pos- 
sible. It should be done. It can be done, Will we do it? I believe 
it is our duty, under the Lord, to find out how to do it and with his 
help do it. 

I bear you my testimony that I know that the Lord leads this people, 
that I know that the gospel restrains us where we should be restrained, 
encourages us where we .should be encouraged, and develops us in every 
way we should be developed. The Lord help us to be true to it in every 
sense, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

moments I occupy may be profitable to this assembly. 

MEN SEEKING EVERYTHING BUT THE WORD OF GOD 

We are living in a time when men are running to and fro in the 
earth, seeking almost everything but the word of God, and surely they 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 



75 



are finding what they seek. It would appear that the chief desire of 
the human family at present is to discover something new. Whether it 
is uplifting or not, it must be different. They are trying out experiments 
of every kind, and many of them 1 are reacting on their heads in a very 
unprofitable way. Our heavenly Father desires his children to be happy. 
He placed our first parents upon this earth that he had prepared for 
them and beautified. He told them just what they might do in order 
to enjoy it, and said that if they would listen to his teachings they 
would be happy here and would lay the foundation for eternal happiness. 
From time to time he has repeated and emphasized that counsel through 
his servants, the prophets. Ever since our first parents were placed 
in the Garden of Eden there has been an evil influence at work that 
has directed men's minds in selfish channels and inclined them to satis- 
fy their own personal longing regardless whether or not it would 
prove profitable to them. The Lord gave our first parents instructions 
and told them that they should have faith in God and from then until 
now those who have had faith in him have been earning an eternal 
reward. They have rejoiced in the blessing of a contented mind and 
have enjoyed peace and happiness that they could have had in no other 
way. 

FAITH THE MOVING CAUSE OF ACTION 

We are informed that without faith we cannot please God. It is 
the moving cause of all action, and Scripture is replete with evidences 
of the power of faith. It was Noah's faith that enabled him to build 
an ark, and as a result of obed : ence to the commandments of God he 
and his household were saved, while those who lacked faith were 
buried in the great flood. It was through faith that Lot and the 
members of his family were preserved when fire from heaven consumed 
the cities of Sodom, and Gomorrah, and destroyed the inhabitants who 
had not faith. 

ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE POWER OF FAITH 

When Daniel continued to pray openly to the God of Isarel, con- 
trary to a decree which had been prepared by his enemies purposely to 
destroy him, he was cast into a den of lions and left there all night. He 
knew his heavenly Father could preserve him and his confidence was 
unshaken. The next morning the king went early to the pit and found 
Dan : el alive. His faith had rendered the wild beasts harmless and 
earned for him the devotion of the king. Three Hebrews, Shadrach 
Meshach and Abednego, who refused to worship a golden image set 
up by Nebuchadnezzar, were cast into a fiery furnace heated seven 
t'mes hot'.er than usual. They trusted in the living God and their 
faith was rewarded by the preservation of their lives. By faith, the 
Prophet Elijah called down fire fiom heaven to consume his offering, 
and the king and the people were convinced that the God of Israel 
was God and that Baal was not. It was by faith that the brother of 



76 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Jared and his followers retained the language of their fathers during 
the confusion of tongues at the Tower of Babel, and were brought to this 
Western Hemisphere in the first submarine of which we have any 
record. It was a similar faith that enabled Lehi to bring his family 
across the sea and plant their feet on this land, choice above all other 
lands. It was faith that enabled the disciples of Jesus to endure the 
persecution that overtook them, and in spite of the opposition of the 
Jews to establish the gospel which the Savior had delivered to them. 
It was because of faith that Joseph Smith went out into the woods 
and knelt down to pray. Born of humble parents and reared in a real 
Christian home, he was imbued with the teachings of the Bible. He 
believed the promise recorded in (he fifth verse of the first chapter of 
James : ''If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth 
to all men liberally, and upbraideth not ; and it shall be given him." 
So in humility he asked which of the churches lie should join ; and he 
was told to join none of them. 1 have no doubt he was gieatly astonish- 
ed to be informed that not any of them was right. Although but a 
youth he was told that he would be called upon to perform an import- 
ant labor if he would live a righteous life. This most remarkable ex- 
perience was the result of faith, and this youth had the heavens opened 
to him and he beheld the Father and the Son and listened to their 
voices. Later he was given additional information and directions 
which brought about the organization of the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints. 

RESULTS OF THE FAITH OF JOSEPH SMITH THE PROPHET 

The people generally were not satisfied with the teachings of their 
churches, but because of lack of faith were not able to find the truth. 
It remained for this boy, not yet fifteen years of age, living in an 
obscure village to test the promise of our heavenly Father, and to 
become the first human being in several centuries to Know through 
seeing them that the Father and Son have bodies like ours. Through faith 
Joseph Smith was able to bring forth the Book of Mormon, translating 
the same from an ancient language, through the gift and power of 
God. By faith, he was able to communicate with heavenly beings and 
resist the temptations of the adversary. Under the direction of our 
heavenly Father, he organized the Church with apostles and prophets ; 
in fact the same form of organization as existed in the days of the 
Savior. He received from John the Baptist the Aaronic Priesthood, and 
Peter, James and John conferred upon him the Higher, or Melchizedek, 
Priesthood, enabling him to officiate in all the ordinances of the 
Church of Jesus Christ. It was through faith that those men who 
accepted him as their leader were able to withstand the assaults of the 
evil one. They were driven from place to place, persecuted and abused ; 
but many of them remained true to the end. They knew that God lived 
and that his all-powerful arm would be extended for their salvation. 
While few in number in the midst of the communities in which they 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 



77 



lived they knew that the power of the heavens would sustain them if 
they performed their part ; and that the power of evil would be unable to 
stay the onward progress of the Church that our Father had again 
established on the earth, in order that his children might be saved. 
It was often difficult to overcome the temptations that beset them, 
but because of faith in God and a determination to do his will, they 
were able to endure. In the early rise of the Chur^i faithful mis- 
ionaries were sent to the nat'ons of the earth to say to all people: 
Repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. Retain all the vir- 
tues that are now yours, all the goodness you possess, but let us 
divide with yon the truth that has been revealed anew from heaven, 
that you may add to the assurance you now possess and profit by it. 
Since then many thousands of the servants of the Lord have traveled 
to and fro in the earth proclaiming the truth of the gospel of our 
Lord, the real gospel of peace, the only panacea for the ills of mankind 
if they but knew it. During the past century Israel has been gathering, 
people have come from all parts of the earth. Tsaiah's prediction is 
fulfilled, the mountain of the Lord's house has been established in the 
lops of the mountains, and exalted above the hills, and all nations are 
flowing unto it; Men, women and children, often in poverty, have been 
willing to leave their home land and loved ones to cross the ocean and 
the great plains, with (he assurance that they were in the keeping of the 
Master of heaven and earth. Thus, for seventy-five years they have 
continued to come, until today countless thousands of the favored 
sons and daughters of God raise their voices in thanksgiving and praise, 
for the faith of those from whom they have descended who dared to 
seek first "the kingdom of God and his righ'eousness," with the 
assurance that all things necessary would be added. 

OUR DUTY BECAUSE OF OUR FAITH 

We live in a wonderful age when the faith necessary to redeem 
mankind is lacking in most of the children of men. During this 
Conference it has been stated that about half of the ministers of a 
great church in the City of New York were not sure of the divinity 
of Jesus Christ. What is it they are lacking? It is the assurance that 
is possessed by the members of the true Church, due to serving the Lord. 
It is the informat ; on they refuse that is offered to them without price 
by men divinely commissioned to teach the promised blessings of the 
Lord resulting from faith ; how gladly we should continue our efforts to 
perform the duties that devolve upon us. All Latter-day Saints should bow 
before the Lord morning and evening and from the depth of our souls 
express our gratitude to our heavenly Father. I hope that those who 
have received this wonderful gift of faith are living to retain it. If any 
lack faith it is because they have not kept the commandments of God. 
Those who do not honor the Sabbath and keep it holy, displease him. 
Some people appear to think that if they have attended religious 
meetings, or performed some portion of the service required of them 



78 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

/ 

on Sunday, they are then at liberty to go to ball games, picture shows, 
or resorts of various kinds, and still continue to enjoy the favor of 
the Master. I say to you that if they persist in doing things of that 
kind, members of the Church will lose their faith ; and the Spirit of our 
heavenly Father will withdraw from them. Let us teach our children 
the gospel of Jesus Christ, not leaving that duty entirely to the auxil- 
iary organizations. At our own firesides, let us explain to them the 
harmfulness of the use of those things that our heavenly Father has 
forbidden; portray to them the beauties of a pure life. Let us conduct 
ourselves so that they will see in us the benefit derived from living the 
gospel of our Lord. Let our homes be assembling places of the families 
that God has blessed us with, and we can render home sacred to our 
dear ones by associating wi ll them under divine influence. 

This is our Father's work. He has always desired the salvation 
of all his children, and has offered to everyone the gospel of Jesus 
Christ, without money and without price. How thankful we ought to 
be, having heard the voice of the Good Shepherd ! We have been 
able to understand the messages and have been made partakers of the 
blessings. 

THE PATH OF HUMILITY, THE PATH OF SAFETY 

I am grateful for the hospitality of your homes, and for kindness 
you extend to me and my brethren as we visit you form time to time. 
In my visits to the miss'on fields I have rejoiced in the development 
of your sons and daughters and in the increase in their faith due to 
obedience to the will of the Lord. It is pleasing to our heavenly Father 
to see us devoting ourselves to the various honorable vocations by which 
we earn a livelihood. Sometimes we meet with reverses and we are 
brought face to face with our inability to do things without divine 
help, 'but if we will humble ourselves and put our trust in the Lord, 
he will not forsake us. The path of humility is always the path of 
safe'y for the members of he Church. 

ADMONITION 

Husbands, be good to your wives ; and wives, be kind to your hus- 
bands ; parents, treasure your children and safeguard them in every 
way. Children, honor your fathers and your mothers, that your days 
may be long in the land which the Lord your God giveth unto you. 
Let us evidence our gratitude to our heavenly Father for the many 
blessing's bestowed upon us, by our living righteous lives. We will 
be tempted, but let us resist the insidious advances of the adversary, and 
avoid those customs and habits that lead us away from the right. Let 
us oppose evil with all our power, and renew our de'ermination to 
be worthy sons and daughters of God ; let us pray for and sustain 
Ithose whom the Lord has called to preside over us ; let us set the 
world an example of righteousness which will preach the gospel as i: 
has never been preached in all the years that have passed. This is 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 



79 



our mission and it is indeed a privilege that we .should prize. We 
can so live that our faith can heal the sick and stay the hand of 
the destroyer when he invades our communities. We should con- 
tinually pray for all our Father's children, that they may turn from 
the error of their ways. We should remember the faithful Saints 
that are scattered among the nations, and petition the Lord to open 
their way that they may be gathered out before the dreadful day when 
the earth will he swept by scourges. In other words, let us be real ser- 
vants of the Lord, doing our duty in all things, in order that we may 
receive the blessings he has promised the faithful; and that we may is 
my humble prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER OWEN BENNION 

(President of the Duchesne Stake of Zion) 

I am reminded strongly, my brethren and sisters, of the vision 
of the Prophet Nephi and of the fruit which he beheld that was white 
and delightsome above all other fruits, and the strong yearning that 
runs through that vision, and the desire that he had that his posterity 
# and those who were associated with him should partake of that fruit. 
T feel that I have in my heart the same yearning that my brethren 
and my sisters may partake of that same fruit through keeping the 
commandments of the Lord, and I earnestly pray that what I say this 
afternoon may contribute to that end. It is not only my testimony, 
my brethren and sisters, that there is joy, satisfaction, progress and 
prosperity in keeping the commandments of the Lord, but it is my 
testimony, through a recollection extending over a period of fifty years, 
that that has been the case. I have known of no promise made by 
the servants of the Lord, either of reward or of punishment, in that 
period of time, but what has inevitably followed. Whatever the ser- 
vants of the Lord have told us to do, that we have done, and the promised 
reward has come. If we have clone the opposite, the promised pun- 
ishment has come. 

As I listened to the statistics that were given yesterday, I thought 
of a definition that President Penrose, I think, gave us one time, 
of the difference between being sure and being certain. He said : 
''I am sure that the sun will rise tomorrow morning. I am certain that 
it rose this morning." From the same standpoint, brethren and sis- 
ters, I can testify that the promises that are made to the Latter-day 
Saints, if they keep the commandments of the Lord, are certain to 
follow. 

I noted yesterday morning, if T heard aright, in the figures given 
by Pres'dent Grant, that this past year we had about six thousand 
converts, and there were baptized into the Church something over 
fourteen thousand children, all, or in the main, children of the Lat- 



80 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

ter-day Saints ; and I wondered if, as parents of Zion, we had so 
trained and educated those children that they understood what they 
were doing when they went into the waters of baptism ; and I won- 
dered if our example in life has been such and will continue to be 
such that the best result can come to those children from our examples. 
It would seem to me that we have a very great responsibility. I would, 
my brethren and sisters, that every mother could say to her son, "Con- 
sider well the ways of your father," and not say to her son: "You keep 
the commandments of the Lord," or, "Your father is going to keep 
the commandments of the Lord, and the results will be good," but could 
say to her son : "Consider well the ways of your father, who has 
kept the commandments of the Lord. Consider his character, his 
kindness and his love for his family, his devotion to his Church, and 
his capability and value as a citizen in the community wherein he lives ; 
and this, in a great measure, is the result of keeping the commandments 
of the Lord." And I would that every father among us could say to 
his daughters : "Consider well the ways of your mother. Consider 
her kindness, her influence, her unselfishness, her devotion to you 
and to me, and to the work of the Lord, the exemplary life that 
she leads, the happiness of her disposition and the value of her life 
that has resulted therefrom. Follow you in her footsteps." How 
many of us. brethren and sisters, can do that? If we cannot do it, 
the Lord will hold us responsible, and we will suffer therefor. But 
that is not all of it ; those children of ours will suffer therefor, and a 
considerable portion of the best part of their lives will be lost through 
our fault. When we are tempted to find fault with our neighbors, 
with our brethren and sisters and with the servants of the Lord, 
let us consider what effect it will have on our children; remembering 
that, in due course of time, knowing that the gospel is true, we may 
come back into the fold and may work and labor diligently, but we 
cannot undo the damage that we have done to our children while we 
were off the track. 

I pray that the Spirit of the Lord may be with us as parents, that 
we may realize our responsibility, that we may set examples worthy 
of imitation before our children, that we can say to them not only, 
"If you keep the commandments of the Lord, you shall be blessed," but 
we can say to them and we can show to them the effect, — that through 
keeping the commandments of the Lord we have been blessed. I ask 
it in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JOHN M. KNIGHT 

(President of the, Ensign Stake of Zion and of the Western States 

Mission) 

Remembering what President Clawson had to say about my voice 
six months ago, I don't know whether I dare speak into this amplifier 



ELDER JOHN M. KNIGHT 



81 



or not. He said that the rafters of the building shook. They may now 
fall upon you. 

I rejoice in the privilege I have of meeting with the Latter-day 
Saints and bearing testimony to the truth. I have listened with a great 
deal of interest to the testimonies that have been borne. They bear the 
stamp of the genuine; they ring true. I don't know of any body of 
people in the world who can affirm, as do the Latter-day Saints, their 
faith in God, and in the divine mission of his Son Jesus Christ. Joseph 
Smith, the prophet, was the pioneer in leading the world away from the 
worship of idols. The wonderful vision given unto him, in the early 
spring of 1820, was a greater vision, from a loftier Sinai, than that 
given to Moses when the commandments written by the finger of God 
were given to ancient Israel ; because, coupled with that revelation was 
the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ. He gave to the world a 
knowledge that God is a personal being, and that Jesus Christ is his 
Son ; that they were like each other, and that he was the Redeemer 
of the world in very deed. 

President Roberts referred to the fact that there are many who 
deny this important truth in the Eastern States mission. Dr. Grant to 
whom he referred, together with Dr. Fosdic and others are quoted very 
frequently by the people of the Western States mission. Not only this 
gentleman, but Mr. Hastings Rashdahl, Dr. H. D. A. Major, and others 
who have presented views along the same line, are being quoted, 
in the Western States at least, as leaders, pioneers if you please, in 
the thought that is being given to the world with relation to Jesus 
Christ, that he was in every sense a man, with human skill and intellect, 
and in no sense was he divine. I am thankful that the Latter-day Saints 
have the witness of the Holy Spirit that this .statement is not true, 
but that the mission of Christ was and is divine. 

I have been interested, as I say, in the positive declarations of our 
brethren and sisters, many times, with relation to these things, particu- 
larly those of our brethren during the sessions of this conference. Pos- 
itive assertion invariably accompanies either deliberate falsehood, pro- 
found ignorance, or else the individual has a definite and positive knowl- 
edge of that which he speaks. I believe the statistics which have been 
read in your hearing are a refutation of the statement that the Latter- 
day Saints are an ignorant people. Surely none of them desire to per- 
petuate a falsehood, to speak falsely concerning that which is true, 
but they have a definite and positive knowledge that God lives, that he 
is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him, and that Jesus Christ is 
the Son of the Living God. I call to mind the words of the Apostle 
Paul in speaking to Timothy. He exhorted him to preach the word, to 
be instant in season and out of season, to reprove and rebuke with all 
long'-suffering', "for," declared he, "the time will come when men will not 
endure sound doctrine, but after their own lusts shall they heap to 
themselves teachers having itching ears, and they shall turn away from 
the truth." The story that has been told you with reference to the crea- 



82 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



tion, with reference to the faith of Daniel, of the Hebrew children, and 
of the prophets of old, are considered by many of our leading theologians 
as fables. The statement that Jesus Christ's mission was divine, and 
that he atoned for the sins of the world is declared to be "bunk." 1 
thank the Lord that in the day and age in which we live a mighty prophet 
was raised up to implant in the hearts of the children of men faith in 
God and in his Son. faith in the holy scriptures, in the word of God. 
faith in the new volume of scripture, the Book of Mormon, faith in 
the covenant that God has made with Israel in the day in which we live, 
for he has made a new covenant with the people of this dispensation, 
and he has written in our hearts a testimony of its divine truth. 

I rejoice in the privilege that is mine to labor in the ministry, both 
at home and abroad, and to declare the gospel of repentance. We are 
fortified as no other people in the world are fortified, because we have 
not only the word of God as it is contained in the scriptures, the Holy 
Bible, but we have these other volumes of scripture, the Book of Mor- 
mon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price, and we 
are enabled to present to the world evidence of their divinity, the one 
bearing witness of the other. It is necessary now, when you come in 
contact with the great majority of people, to prove to them that the word 
of God is true, that it is reliable, that it is authentic, that it is worth 
while investigating. The Latter-day Saints, as I say, are lortified with 
evidence that these things are true. 

I see that the time I should occupy is gone. I bear you my witness, 
my brethren and sisters and my frie-ids, that I do know that this is 
God's work, and that it is the power of God unto salvation, that the 
Lord did raise up the Prophet Joseph Smith, in the dispensation in 
which we live, to reestablish his work in the earth, and I bear witness 
that it will continue onward to the fulfilment of its destiny, and all 
the powers of earth and hell combined can never stay its progress. 
God bless you. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN 

( Of the First Council of Seventy, and President of the California 

Mission) 

It is certainly a very great privilege, my brethren and sisters, to 
be permitted to take part in a great conference gathering such as this 
is. I sincerely hope that during the few moments that have been al- 
lotted to me I may he prompted by that good Spirit that has been 
so manifest in the remarks of the brethren who have been called to 
occupy this position. 

I am very glad to say that the work of the Lord is prospering 
in the California mission. You have already heard, from the open- 
ing remarks made by President Grant, and the presiding authorities re- 



ELDER JOSEPH W . McMURRIN 



83 



cently thought it advisable to establish a stake of Zion with head- 
quarters in Los Angeles, to be known as the Los Angeles stake of 
Zion. Elder George W. McCune, former president of the Eastern 
States mission, has been called to preside as the president of the stake, 
and is assisted by Elders J. Muir and George F. Harding, who are his 
counselors, and a company of stalwart men who have been called to 
assist them as members of the high council. A number of bishops, 
all splendid men, have been selected and ordained and have chosen 
their counselors ; while in other branches the bishops have not as 
yet been selected. The people hail with very great delight the ac- 
tion that has been taken by the presiding authorities, in the organ- 
ization of the stake ; and of course we cannot but believe that with 
the increased number of men who will feel the responsibilites that 
have been placed upon them, there will be a greater movement for- 
ward with the work of the Lord in that section of the country than 
at any time in the past. The bre'Lren who have been selected to 
fill places of responsibility, all seem to sense the nature of that re- 
sponsibility that has been placed upon them and to be anxious to dis- 
charge their duties to the best of their power. 

So far as the missionary work is concerned, I am happy to say, 
my brethren and sis'ers, that the Spirit of the Lord is with the young 
men and women who have been assigned to the California mission. 
The only thing that v/e regret is that we do not have larger numbers 
of men and women sent to labor in that mission ; and yet I realize 
that vt^e have no ground to complain, or to feel that we have not been 
considered as favorably as any other mission in the sending of men 
and women to operate in the crying of repentance and in expounding 
the doctrines of the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. It has been and 
is a very great delight to me to have the companionship of the 
young elders and the young sisters who have been sent into that feld. 
It is a source of never ending wonder to note the development that 
takes place on the part of these missionaries, for it is not an uncom- 
mon thing to find these young people sorely depressed in their feelings 
when they first attempt to stand up before the people, and they have 
but very little to say, and a good many of them do not feel that they 
can stand up and bear record that they know that they have been 
called to preach the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ and that thev 
know the doctrines thev have been sent to teach are the power of 
Gqd unto salvation. It is a very great delight, nevertheless, my 
brethren and sisters, to note on the part of all of these young people 
that there is no disposition to be in any way hypocritical or untruth- 
ful or in any way to pretend that they are possessed of knowledge 
that has not been given to them. 

I would like to say to the fathers and mothers who may have sons 
and daughters in California, that while some of them may have come 
into the mission field with but little understanding of the gospel, they 
have come with a wonderful spirit of obedience, ready and willing 



84 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



to go and come as they may be directed by proper authority, and ready 
and anxious to do, to the very best of their power, the duties that rest 
upon them as preachers of the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. While 
they may manifest in the beginning a considerable degree of timidity 
in their missionary labors, it has always been a source of great joy to me 
to discover that after they have striven to the best of their power to 
magnify the callings whereunto they have been called, they have been 
touched with the mysterious power that reveals truths, that has been 
spoken of in these conference meetings — the power of the Holy Ghost. 
If there has been doubt in their minds when they came Into the mission 
field, it is soon banished away, and in a brief time they are not only 
willing to bear record to the truth of the gospel but they are very 
anxious to have that opportunity ; and I want to say that they bear 
that witness under the power and inspiration of the Spirit of the living 
God. They bear witness in such a manner that their teachings reach 
the hearts of the people and bring honest hearted souls to an investiga- 
tion of the message that has been committed into their hands. 

I regret that sometimes there seems to be too great anxiety on the 
part of fathers and mothers to have their missionary sons and daughters 
return from the mission field earlier than is desirable. The declaration 
has been made again and again by the presiding authorities that there 
is no appointed time for a missionary to> be in the mission field. Presi- 
dent Heber J. Grant, in one of our conferences in 1921, set forth in very 
strong language the necessity of fathers and mothers giving their sons 
and daughters an opportunity to fill a well rounded out mission ; and 
I would like to plead with fathers and mothers that they give their sons 
and daughters those opportunities. I am not unmindful of the fact 
that we have been passing through a time of serious financial distress 
and that many fathers and mothers have had great difficulty in obtain- 
ing the means necessary to meet the expenses of their missionary repre- 
sentatives in the mission field. Let me also ,say, my brethren and 
sisters, that it is a very rare thing for a missionary ever to have the 
opportunity of going the second time into the mission field to lift up 
his voice in proclamation of the truth that has been restored, and when 
he is baptized with the spirit of testimony and with the spinr of under- 
standing; when his heart is in the work and when he is 
anxious to cry repentance among the people, it is greatly 
to be regretted that ofttimes fathers and mothers, even when 1 
fear there is no very great necessity for such action, send word to their 
sons and daughters that the burden is more than they can bear and that 
because two years, forsooth, have passed away, they should now return 
from the mission field. I am happy to ,say that these missionaries, both 
men and women, have no desire to return. I have seen them shed 
tears of sorrow when the announcement has been made that they 
have been honorably released to return to their homes. Their hearts 
are in the work of God. They are anxious to magnify their callings ; 
and I think no father or mother can spend money to any better advan-

tage than to give their sons and daughters, when they are in the field, full ' 
opportunity to labor and to deliver the message that has been committed 
into their hands, and to become better and better established in the 
things of God. 

I rejoice in their companionship. I thank God for the opportunity 
of being with them. I rejoice in the gospel that I am seeking, with 
them, to promulgate in the California mission, and I know it is the 
power of God unto salvation ; and bear witness thereto, with joy and 
gladness in my soul, and with understanding and knowledge that I 
speak the truth, in the name of Jesus Christ.. Amen. 

President Grant read a telegram from President Wallace Calder 
of the Uintah stake of Zion asking to be excused from presence at the 
Conference owing to the impassability of the roads. 

The choir sang, "The Lord is great, who shall not fear him?" 

The choir and congregation sang the "Doxology." 

The closing prayer was offered by Elder George Bowles, a re- 
cently returned missionary from the Hawaiian Islands. 

The Conference adjourned until 10 a. m. Sunday. 

THIRD DAY 

MORNING SESSION 

Sunday, April 8, 1923 

At 10 o'clock President Grant announced the opening hymn. All 
the seats in the Tabernacle were occupied, as well as the aisles, and 
many stood during the services. It was announced during the session 
that four thousand people outdoors, near the Bureau of Information, 
were listening to the sermons in the Tabernacle conveyed by radio, 
which did away with the necessity of speakers at the Bureau of Infor- 
mation. An overflow meeting was held in the Assembly Hall, crowded 
to the doors. 

The congregation and the Salt Lake Tabernacle choir sang the 
hymn, "Come, come, ye Saints, no toil nor labor fear." 
Prayer was offered by Elder Willard Young. 
The choir sang the anthem, "Let the mountains shout for joy." 

PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 

I sincerely desire, my brethren and sisters, that during the few 
moments which I may occupy this morning, the exercise of your faith 
in my behalf may enable me, through the blessings of the Lord upon 
whom I depend, to present properly the thought which I have in my 
mind at this time. I shall read first from the twelfth chapter of St. 
Mark, beginning at the thirteenth verse:

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



MEANING OF CHRIST'S ANSWER TO THE PHARISEES 

"And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, 
to catch him in his words. 

"And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that thou 
.art true, and carest for no man : for thou regardest not the person of men, but 
teachest.the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not? 

"Shall we give or shall we not give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said 
unto them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny, that I may see it. 

"And they brought it. And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and 
superscription? And they said unto him, Caesar's. 

"And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the things that are 
Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's." 

In looking for a text upon which to base the brief remarks which 
I expect to make, I thought of these words of the Redeemer of the 
world. They are simple words and to the .superficial observer have little 
import except to impress upon one the fact that inasmuch as' Israel 
at the time was tributary to Rome, it was necessary to recognize her 
sovereignty, and render submission to the system of taxation which she 
might impose. A more careful analysis of this scripture, associating 
it with other words spoken by the Redeemer, and the example of 
his life give it a deeper and far more important meaning. It may be 
paraphrased and made to read : Render unto man that which belongs 
to man, and to God that which pertains to him. I wish to make it 
read as I desire to interpret its meaning: Render allegiance and sub- 
mission to the laws of men in civil government, and to the laws of God 
in that which pertains to the Kingdom of Heaven. 

NATURE OF CIVIL AND RELIGIOUS LAWS 

I suppose that at a very early period of the existence of man, it was 
discovered that for the proper protection and development of society 
it was necessary to enact laws, and delegate to individuals authority 
to administer and enforce them. Violation of these laws subjected the 
transgressor to penalties, more or less severe, as the offence justified. 

The outward expression of religion is the act of worship, by which 
we show our faith in a supreme being, to whom we owe allegiance and 
service. Since the very beginning of history, in so far as it pertains 
to the present race of mankind, communication has existed between our 
Father in heaven, and his children who are here upon earth. At times 
direct communication may have been interrupted, but always to be re- 
established, that the purposes of the Almighty might not be frustrated. 

Certain fundamental laws have been given to man, through obe- 
dience to which he may be in harmony with the will of the Father, or 
out of harmony, as he obeys or rejects the requirements which are made. 
These requirements are not enforced by compulsory means, the penalty 
being the loss of that which might have been gained through obedience. 

In contradistinction of this the civil law demands obedience whether 
we will or will not, and if we refuse, physical force is applied to enforce 
submission. Briefly stated obedience to civil law is compulsory, obe- 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 



87 



dience to the law given by the Lord is entirely optional. For violation 
of the former, man is answerable to the law which he, himself, has 
created; for violation of the latter, man is answerable to his Makei. 

PROPER RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CHURCH AND THE STATE 

I know of no other question which has so disturbed the peaceful 
relationship which should exist between neighbors, communities and 
nations, as has the erroneous and perverted opinions which have pre- 
vailed regarding the proper relationship which should exist between the 
church and the state, and the application and effect of the laws given 
by the Lord, and those enacted by man. 

It is plain to one who is familiar with the written, and spoken, word 
of the Lord, that there has not been, and is not now, justifiable cause 
for the misunderstanding, but notwithstanding this fact there has always 
been conflict. You who are familiar with the world's history know 
that there have been times when the state has waged unrelenting war 
upon the church, and you are also aware that the church has waged 
more relentless war, if that were possible, against those who differed 
from its views, or refused submission to its interpretation of the' spiritual 
law. 

ILLUSTRATIONS OF CONFLICTS BETWEEN THE CHURCH AND THE STATE 

The conflict between the church and the state has not been more 
vicious, or devoid of mercy, than has that which has prevailed between 
people who were professors of religion, and professing to follow the 
same Master. 

In 1487 the head of one church, notwithstanding the fact that he 
had assumed the name Innocent, ordered the extermination of the 
Waldenses, and France, in obedience to the decree, drove from their 
homes, to find asylum in the Alps, or killed people who were among her 
best citizens, because they dared differ from others in their religious 
views. 

The massacre of St. Bartholomew will never be forgotten, and must 
sometimes be atoned for. The church sent the Duke of Alva to the 
Netherlands with full authority to exterminate all who were not orthodox 
in their faith and religious practice. 

No human pen will ever write, no tongue can tell, the story of 
suffering and injustice which, because of difference in religious faith 
and practice, has been inflicted upon the Hebrew people. Driven from 
the Promised Land, the home of their fathers, they have been denied 
the right of citizenship, and refused participation in the political and 
business activities of the world. They have been ruthlessly slain. 
Jewish mothers have looked on in anguish while the tongues have been 
torn from the mouths of their children, their hands severed, and bodies 
mutilated because they refused to renounce their faith, or deny the God 
of their fathers. 

Whatever their mistakes may have been, however much the re- 



88 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



sponsibility for their suffering may rest upon them, I know of no 
parallel of faith in, and devotion to, an ideal, comparable with that 
manifested by the Jewish people during the past 1900 years. That they 
have survived it, and retained their nationalism as they have is one of 
the miracles of the age. That the Lord will recognize their sacrifices, 
and, in his own time and way, restore them to their former place in his 
favor is certain, for he who is definite in power to accomplish has 
declared it. 

Religious fanaticism drove the Puritans from the old world to the 
new, where they hoped to be free from bigotry and persecution, and 
they were hardly established here when they burned innocent women 
who were accused of witchcraft, and drove from their communities 
men who differed from them in their interpretation of the scripture. 

It was because of difference of opinion regarding faith and worship 
that the Latter-day Saints were driven from the state of Missouri, and 
their possessions confiscated, to find temporary asylum in Illinois, from 
which state they later migrated to these mountain valleys, where they 
hoped to find peace and opportunity to worship the Lord in their own 
way. 

CONFLICT THE RESULT OF IGNORANCE OF LAW 

I have frequently, in view of recent events, asked myself this ques- 
tion: Have we, modern people, who live in the most enlightened and 
progressive period of the world's history, with the experience of the 
past to guide us, and knowledge of the future, as it has been outlined 
by the prophets who have lived before, overcome this needless, unjusti- 
fiable, erroneous conception of the proper relationship which exists, or 
should exist, between the church and the state? Do we properly dif- 
ferentiate between our obligation of obedience to civil law, in the admin- 
istration of temporal affairs, and our obligation to the church, which 
represents divine law, given for the purpose of preparing men for 
future glory and exaltation in the kingdom of heaven ? Where conflict 
exists between the two, it is clearly the result of either ignorance, or 
wilful misinterpretation of both civil and ecclesiastical law. 

THE LORD HAS SPOKEN PLAINLY ON SPIRITUAL AND TEMPORAL AFFAIRS 

With the opening of a gospel dispensation the Lord has always 
spoken plainly, defining the duties of those who accept his word, in 
regard to both spiritual and temporal affairs, and after defining our 
duties, and the obligation which is upon us, leaves us to accept and 
perform, and thus gain the future or present blessings which are predi- 
cated upon observance of the law, or reject, as we may choose. His 
word to us upon this important question, in the present dispensation, to 
which I wish to call particular attention is no exception. 

HIS WORD UPON THIS IMPORTANT QUESTION 

In the very early history of the Church the right relationship 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 89 



which should exist between the church and state was raised, and in 
order that there might be no misunderstanding in regard to this im- 
portant question the following was adopted and published, and has 
been the recognized attitude of the Latter-day Saints since that time. 
I read from section 134 of the Doctrine and Covenants: 

"We believe that governments were instituted of God for the benefit of 
man ; and that he holds men accountable for their acts in relation to them, both 
in making laws and administering them, for the good and safety of society. 

"We believe that no government can exist in peace, except such laws 
are framed and held inviolate as will secure to each individual the free exercise 
of conscience, the right and control of property, and the protection of life. 

"We believe that all governments necessarily require civil officers and 
magistrates to enforce the laws of the same, and that such as will administer the 
law in equity and justice, should be sought for and upheld by the voice of the 
people, if a republic, or the will of the sovereign. 

"We believe that religion is instituted of God; and that men are amenable 
to him, and to him only, for the exercise of it, unless their religious opinions 
prompt them to infringe upon the rights and liberties of others; but we do 
not believe that human law has a right to interfere in proscribing rules of worship 
to bind the consciences of men, nor dictate forms for public or private devotion ; 
that the civil magistrate should restrain crime, but never control conscience; 
should punish guilt, but never suppress the freedom of the soul. * * * 

"We believe that every man should be honored in his station, rulers 
and 'magistrates as such, being placed for the protection of the innocent, and 
the punishment of the guilty; and that to the laws all men owe respect and 
deference, as without them peace and harmony would be supplanted by anarchy 
and terror ; human laws being instituted for the express purpose of regulating our 
interests as individuals and nations, between man and man; and divine laws given 
of heaven, prescribing rules on spiritual concerns, for faith and worship, both 
to be answered by man to his Maker. * * * 

"We do not believe it just to mingle religious influence with civil govern- 
ment, whereby one religious society is fostered and another proscribed in its 
spiritual privileges, and the individual rights of its members, as citizen, denied. 

"We believe that all religious societies have a right to deal with their 
members for disorderly conduct, according to the rules and regulations of such 
societies; providing that such dealings be for fellowship and good standing; 
but we do not believe that any religious society has authority to try men on the 
right of property or life, to take from them this world's goods, or to put them 
in jeopardy of either life or limb, or inflict any physical punishment upon them. 
They can only excommunicate them from their society, and withdraw from them 
their fellowship." 

CAN A BETTER BILL OF EIGHTS BE FOUND? 

I ask you, my brethren and sisters, I ask the people of the world, 
where can a better bill of rights, defining the proper relationship of 
the Church and the State, the civil and the ecclesiastical authority, be 
found, than that which I have read? Can error or justifiable objection 
be found in it ? 

The Latter-day Saints believe that the coming of Columbus to 
this continent was part of the divine plan by which this land, which 
had been held in reserve, might become a place of refuge, and asylum 
for the oppressed and down-trodden of all nations, that freedom of 
worship, and exercise of conscience, in righteousness, might be enjoyed

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



by all people. We believe that the Lord inspired the framers of our 
government to give us onr legislative, executive and administrative 
system of government, by which our laws are enacted and enforced. 
This system, having been given of the Lord, it is not strange that the 
administration of our civil affairs corresponds so nearly with the or- 
ganization of the Church, and still differs so greatly in the one essential 
feature. 

CONTRAST BETWEEN CIVIL AND RELIGIOUS LAWS 

Our civil laws are enacted by Congress, that body being gov- 
erned, in framing the law, by the Constitution of our country ; by our 
state legislatures under authority of congress, and our precincts and 
municipalities under authority granted by the state legislatures. The 
officers who administer these laws are chosen by the voice of the peo- 
ple. The laws enacted by our precincts and municipalities, and the 
power of the lesser judges and officers who enforce them are limited in 
regard to both territorial jurisdiction, and power to inflict punishment. 
Legislative laws have jurisdiction over all of the people of the state, 
while congressional laws must be obeyed in all parts of the republic. 

Decisions rendered by precinct, municipal or district judges are 
subject to review, on appeal, and may be carried to the supreme court, 
whose decision is final. To each of these courts authority is given to 
enforce its decrees by compulsory means. We may protest, it may be 
contrary to our idea of right and justice, we may say that we will not 
submit, but it is all in vain, the civil law compels submission. It may 
impose heavy fines, and if we refuse to pay, take our property by force 
to satisfy its judgment. It may incarcerate us in prison, for life if the 
offense justifies, or even deprive us of life itself. 

In contrast to this, the laws which govern the Church are given 
us by the Lord our God. He is the author of them, he is our law- 
giver. He has revealed to us the order of Church government and 
designated the officers who are to administer its affairs. The ward 
organizations, with their limited administrative powers, the stakes with 
their enlarged jurisdiction, and finally the presiding authorities, who 
have jurisdiction over all of the affairs of the Church, have all been 
given us by the Lord. 

WHERE CIVIL AND RELIGIOUS POWERS DIFFER ENTIRELY 

The men who administer the affairs of the Church are its priest- 
hood, the word signifying, collectively, those who are chosen and or- 
dained to perform sacred religious functions. The powers delegated 
to this body of priesthood, chosen to ! administer the affairs of the 
Church, while similar to our civil administration, differs entirely 
from it in the manner of administration, let me read : 

"Behold, there are many called, but few are chosen. And why are they not 
chosen ? 

"Because their hearts are set so much upon the things of this world, and 
aspire to the honors of men, that they do not learn this one lesson — 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 



91 



"That the rights of the Priesthood are inseparably connected with the 
powers of heaven, and that the powers of heaven cannot be controlled nor 
handled only up,on the principles of righteousness. 

"That they may be conferred upon us, is true; but when we undertake 
to cover our sins, or to gratify our pride, our vain ambition, or to exercise 
control or dominion or compulsion upon the souls of the children of men, in 
ahy degree of unrighteousness, behold, the heavens withdraw themselves ; the 
Spirit of the Lord is grieved; and when it is withdrawn, Amen to the Priest- 
hood or authority of that man. * * * 

"Hence many are called, but few are chosen. 

"No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the 
Priesthood, only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meek- 
ness, and by love unfeigned; 

"By kindness, and pure knowledge, which shall greatly enlarge the soul 
without hypocrisy, and without guile." 

I have read from the Doctrine and Covenants of the Church, 
section 121. 

Again I ask you, my brethren and sisters, can any just criticism 
be offered to this plain declaration regarding the prerogatives and 
rights of the priesthood? Can anything be wrong which is accom- 
plished by persuasion, by long suffering, gentleness, by kindness and 
love unfeigned, Where are we to find a definition of the authority 
and functions of the priesthood superior to, or even the equal of that 
which I have just read. If it exists my attention has never been called 
to it. 

THE SYSTEM OF CHURCH COURTS 

It is true that a system of Church courts has been given, and 
judges provided whose duty it is to watch over the Church, to hear 
cases where differences may exist between Church members, and to 
take cognizance of cases where the rules governing the conduct of 
members, whose acts may be un-Christian, immoral, or opposed to jus- 
tice and righteousness, are concerned. 

This system begins with the teachers, who are expected to be 
familiar with the lives and conduct of the members of their wards, and 
who seek to induce, by persuasion and love, those who may have de- 
parted from the way of the Lord, to return to it. Where members 
refuse, or neglect to be governed by the council of the teachers, their 
case may be taken to the bishopric, and if they fail to reach a satis- 
factory adjustment may be carried to the high council, and from there 
appealed to the First Presidency. 

These Church courts, while corresponding closely to our civil 
courts, differ entirely from the latter in this respect. Whether it be 
the decision of a bishop's court, a high council or the First Presidency, 
no effort is made to enforce the decre contrary to the will of the ac- 
cused. Disinterested men 1 hear the case, there are no lawyers to in- 
terpret, or misinterpret the law, the accused has the right to appear 
and speak in his own behalf, and to introduce evidence, after which the 
decision is rendered. If the accused refuses to submit to the findings 
of the court, the only penalty attached is the withdrawal of the hand

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



of. fellowship, or excommunication from the Church, after which he is 
permitted to go his way in peace, so far as his conscience may permit 
peace to dwell in his soul. 

THE CIVIL LAW COMPULSORY, THE CHURCH LAW VOLUNTARY 

The purpose of this review, hrief and very imperfect as it is, is 
to call your attention to the fact that the civil law is given for the pro- 
tection and control of our temporal affairs, while the Priesthood is 
Conferred upon us for the control and development of the Church : 
that the former differs from the latter in that one is compulsory, the 
other entirely voluntary. To the civil law all men must submit, regard- 
less of race, creed or condition, while to the priesthood man may sub- 
mit or not, as he may choose. 

When arraigned before Pilate one of the charges brought against 
the Redeemer was that he was guilty of sedition, in that he had de- 
clared himself to be a king. Yes he answered, but my kingdom is not 
of this world. It was not a menace to the kingdom of Herod, or the 
empire of Rome. His was the kingdom of heaven, and had nothing 
to do with the kingdoms of this world, except that he taught his fol- 
lowers to be obedient to them, but the people, failing to distinguish be- 
tween the temporal and spiritual could not comprehend. 

SUMMARY AND APPLICATION 

So, my brethren and sisters. T reach this conclusion : That it is 
the duty of each member of the Church to honor and obey the law of 
the land, and sustain the men who are chosen to administer it, in so far 
as they do so in righteousness and justice. That the Priesthood is 
conferred upon us for the development and control of the Church of 
Christ, and that it cannot be legitimately used for any other purpose. 
That whenever we use it for the promotion of personal interests, to 
gratify personal pride, or ambition, or apply it by compulsion or re- 
straint, we are upon dangerous ground, and not in harmony with the 
word of the Lord. My conception is that the exercise of the Priest- 
hood can only be legitimately used where the purpose is to provide equal 
opportunity for all, in the sphere occupied by each member of the 
Church, and special privileges to none, except as men may have merited 
honor and distinction through devotion to the work of the Lord. 

Do not understand me to infer that men holding the Priesthood 
are not entitled to participate in all of the activities of the state, and 
enjoy any and all of the emoluments to which citizenship entitles them, 
but this participation, and the honors which may come to them should 
be the reward of merit; and the influence of the Priesthood, as such, 
should not be used to accomplish their personal desires. 

Neither do I wish to infer that the Priesthood should not be exer- 
cised in the promotion and development of the temporal interests of 
the people. It is a poor system of religion, indeed, which treats only 
with the salvation of the .souls of men, while it leaves their bodies to 
perish. 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 



93 



What a simple thing it is, and yet how vitally important. If the 
people of the world could only be taught obedience to this doctrine, to 
willingly honor and obey the law of the land in the control of civil af- 
fairs, leaving all men to answer to the Lord in matters of faith and 
worship, each having decent respect for rights and opinions of his 
neighbor, thus rendering to Caesar that which belongs to Caesar, and 
to God that which pertains to his Kingdom, peace would soon prevail 
throughout the earth, Christ's Kingdom would be established, and the 
will of the Lord would be done of earth, as it is done in heaven. May 
that day be hastened, is my humble prayer, through Jesus Christ. Amen.

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

The following note was read by President Heber J. Grant, after ex- 
plaining that Brother Smith went out to ascertain how the crowd in 
front of the Bureau of Information was hearing while President Ivins 
was speaking : 

President Ivins is being heard by about four thousand people as 
plainly as you are hearing him. His voice carries to the Valley House 
corner, but you can't catch the words. — George Albert Smith. 

I have a note from President Edward J. Wood, announcing that 
he was detained on account of a storm and railroad accident. For 
Brother Wood's benefit I will say that we started at the head of the 
list of stakes and have heard from about one-third of all the stake 
presidents, each talking ten minutes. 

We will now hear from Brother Wood for ten minutes 

ELDER EDWARD J. WOOD 

(President of the Alberta Stake of Zion) 

I appreciate very much the privilege of being with you this morn- 
ing, and am sorry I was detained Friday and Saturday. Those living 
in remote places more fully appreciate the privilege ot meeting to- 
gether with the general authorities of the Church than you who live 
here in the center stakes of the Church. 

I have listened with interest to the remarks of President Ivins, 
and have thought of reading from the Pearl of Great Price, the first 
chapter of the Book of Abraham : 

"And, finding there was greater happiness and peace and rest for me, 
I sought for the blessings of the fathers, and the right whereunto I 
should be ordained to administer the same; having been myself a follower 
of righteousness, desiring also to be one who possessed great knowledge, and 
to be a greater follower of righteousness, and to possess a greater knowl- 
edge, and to be a father of many nations, a prince of peace, and desiring to 
receive instructions, and to keep the commandments of God, I became a 
rightful heir, a High Priest, holding the right belonging to the fathers. 

"It was conferred upon me from the fathers; it came down from the 
fathersi, from the beginning of time, yea, even from the beginning, or before

the foundations of the tarth to the present time, even the right of the 
first-horn, on the first man, who is Adam, our first father, through the 
fathers, unto me. 

"I sought for mine appointments unto the Priesthood, according to 
the appointment of God unto the fathers concerning the seed." 

I am. always impressed, in attending these general conferences — 
and it is very few that I have missed during the last twenty years — 
with the thought of how much greater power we would exert if we but 
fully followed the example set by Abraham, if we would think so much 
orf our calling in the Priesthood that we would know that in it there 
is great happiness, peace, rest and blessings of the fathers, if we would 
only righteously seek for these blessings. Not only did Abraham 
seek for these blessings for himself, but he sought to be ordained 
to administer the same. If we had the faith that Abraham had, at all 
times, the Lord's blessings would be poured out upon us. I am sure 
that the general authorities of the Church, with President Grant at the 
head, have this same faith ; but if we, throughout the various stakes of 
Zion, from Canada, where I live, to Mexico in the South, would seek 
in all righteousness the happiness, the peace, and rest and the content- 
ment that conies from the Priesthood; and then not be satisfied with 
this, but seek in all humility to administer these blessing;, and explain 
these privileges to those with whom we labor, how much greater would 
be the progress of the work in which we are engaged ! 

I have spent many years in the islands. I have noted the extreme 
faith of our Polynesian Islanders. They seem at all times to seek 
for the right to preach the gospel, to administer in the ordinances 
thereof among their fellow people. I have seen the sick healed. I 
have noted the extreme faith, the perfect faith which became a knowl- 
edge to many of them, even before they joined the Church by bap- 
tism; how they would set the example to many of us of the fact that 
through faith comes knowledge. 

I remember on one occasion one of our sisters said that a certain 
member of the village she lived in had a very sick child. The parents 
did not belong to the Church, but they had heard the doctrines of the 
Church as preached by the elders. She asked that we come and admin- 
ister to the child. The child looked like it was dead ; and when I told 
her that it might be too late, she asked me if I had the right to admin- 
ister to the sick. I told her, yes. She said: "Why do you hesitate? 
If you will just lay your hands on the child it will recover." We were 
so struck with the extreme faith — the knowledge of this good sister — 
that we administered to the child. 

We left the village shortly after and did not .see her for several 
months. While on another island one afternoon, to show you how the 
Lord works in a marvelous way to bring to the attention of the people 
his doctrines, I saw a group of natives off under the trees. They 
were cutting cocoannts with a long knife. It was in the early days 
of the Church, away back in 1889. At that time we had been per- 



ELDER EDWARD J. WOOD

secuted. I thought I was being led into a trap, when all at once I 
noticed the natives surrounding me. I was alone. I wondered what 
might take place. All at once a woman stepped out from the group 
of natives. She offered me her hand and spoke to me, but I did not 
remember her. Then she called a child, sat the child on the stump of a 
cocoanut tree, and 'bore this testimony to the people: "This child of 
mine is a living example of the power and mission of the Church which 
this man represents. I am the daughter of the head chief. I invite 
this missionary to come to our village." They all paid very kind respect 
while she preached the gospel as I had never heard any other native 
do. Such knowledge, such extreme faith, I marveled at. I followed 
her to her village. She called the village together, and we had a very 
pleasant evening, and it was late in the night before I retired to bed. 

In the morning I felt something on my neck, and I slapped it with 
my hand and I was bitten by a centipede, — a very deadly, poisonous 
insect there. My hand commenced to swell and the natives thought I 
would surely die. After a few moments, this good woman (none 
of them belonged to the Church) heard of my trouble and she came to 
me. She said: "Why, Mr. Wood, you administered to my child, 
administer to yourself and you will be healed." I had some con- 
secrated oil and I administered to my hand. The people crowded 
around me. My hand had swollen to a terrible size and the pain 
was intense. This woman stood by, and when I looked at her I was 
filled with that feeling that comes from the love and respect of the 
natives one to another. The swelling commenced to go away, just as 
a person would take a cloth off his hand, and I wai all right. She 
bore that testimony to the people again that she knew positively that 
the Lord had restored again his Church, and with it the former bless- 
ings. She then longed for the people to join, so that they could preach 
to other towns and other villages. 

I am pleased to bear this testimony that I am sure the faith 
among the Latter-day Saints, as of old, is increasing. I pray with 
you, that like Abraham we may seek in all diligence and all humility 
the right to administer these principles and these ordinances among 
the children of men, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I would like to ask the people who are outside of this building to 
quit whispering and talking to one another, for the benefit of those 
who would like to hear what is going on in this building. There are 
a great many people outside who are anxious to hear, and those who 
are talking and carrying on conversations are preventing them from 
having the privilege of doing so.

GENERAL CONEERENCE 



ELDER HYRUM G. SMITH 

{Presiding Patriarch of the Church) 

It is a very inspiring sight, indeed, to behold the multitude gath- 
ered here in the tabernacle, and then to see the gathering on the out- 
side where they are listening to the voices of the speakers, through a 
little device which the Lord has inspired in the minds of men to teach 
a very simple truth ; and I desire to bear testimony to that truth, and 
am grateful for the privilege of doing so. 

Ever since our early infancy, as members of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints, we have been taught to pray to our heav- 
enly Father, knowing and feeling and believing that our prayers would 
be heard and answered. Hundreds and hundreds of our members bear 
testimony that the Lord has heard and answered their prayers. 1, 
too, know that the Lord lives and that he does hear 1 and answer our 
prayers. And now, through a simple little device which the Lord has 
inspired in the hearts of men, it is my faith and my testimony that the 
Lord is going to teach the world that he actually can and does hear our 
prayers, and hears the prayers of those who seek him in faith, for faith 
is a wonderful power in the world. When we are in tune with our 
Creator, with our Redeemer, and seek him in faith, we are wonderfully 
blessed, and our prayers are heard and answered ; and this simple truth 
is going to be made so plain and so positive that no one will be left 
in doubt. 

I am grateful, too, that we are given our agency — another wonder- 
ful but simple truth which the Lord has made plain to us. In the lines 
of poetry written in our hymn book, two verses read as follows : 

"Know this, that every soul is free 

To choose his life and what he'll be; 

For this eternal truth is given, 

That God will force no man to heaven. 

"He'll call, persuade, direct aright, 
Bless him with wisdom, love and light; 
In nameless ways be good and kind, 
But never force the human mind." 

I was attending a quarterly conference of one of the stakes of 
Zion a few years ago, when the entire conference was characterized 
by testimony bearing. Both men and women, holding different stations 
in the stake, were called upon to bear their testimonies. At the close 
of the conference a good brother who had been out of the Church for 
over thirty years, came to the president of the stake, witn tears in his 
eyes, and said: "President, I have stood it just as long as I can and I 
can stand it no longer. At your first opportunity I want to be baptized 
again. I have been out of this Church for thirty years. My children 
have grown up around me, many of them following my teachings and 
my example, under the influence of the spirit of apostasy. My grand- 
children are being taught the principles of the gospel, and I rejoice in 
the fact that they, as well as some of my children, are coming back into 



ELDER HYRUM G. SMITH 



97 



the Church and receiving its blessings. I regret that I have been out 
of the Church so much of my life ; and while I have nourished a grudge 
and hard feelings, yet I have known in my heart that this is the Church 
of God. Now I regret those actions. I regret the lives of my children, 
that they have been nourished largely in the spirit of apostasy ; now, for 
the remaining years of my life, I want to live in the Church and change 
my life that it may conform, to the teachings of Christ, that I, too, with 
this multitude who have borne their testimonies, may enjoy the Spirit 
of the Lord and receive forgiveness." He was afterwards baptized. 
His children also, many of them, turned from their ways of apostasy 
and came into the Church. A glorious privilege, a blessing coming 
again to that household. 

I rejoice in the blessing of our agency that when we are moved by 
the spirit of truth, and our testimonies are so enlarged within us that 
we are directed along the lines of conduct and action which bring us 
in keeping and in touch with many glorious privileges and blessings. 

I rejoice in my membership and association with this multitude of 
men bearing the holy Priesthood. No place else in all the world can 
you go and (see a sight such as I behold this moment — the faces of 
men bearing the holy Priesthood gathered together in the name of 
the Lord Jesus Christ, all with an undoubting testimony that the Lord 
lives and that this is his work. 

I rejoice in this wonderful privilege and being numbered with you 
in this glorious work. I would to God that all could understand the 
simple truths that we secure through the testimony of the Spirit, for 
it burns within our hearts, and makes known to us the truth. Let 
me admonish you, my brethren and sisters, to cherish that little monitor 
that is within you, for it will guide and direct you in the ways of 
truth and of correct and right living. 

I regret that there are many among us who are not <±s loyal as we 
should like to have them. It grieves me and it grieves my co-laborers, 
and I am sure it grieves the Lord, when word comes that our fellows 
have been untrue to trusts imposed upon them or in them; and we, 
every one of us, know that it is wrong when we are untrue to a trust, 
or break a sacred confidence. I pray that God will continue to be 
mindful of us as his children, that we may hearken unto those still 
small whisperings that they may guide us always in the paths of virtue 
and right and loyalty to trust ; that we may be fit instruments in the 
hands of God to fulfil his purposes in the earth; and do it without 
embarrassment to him or to his work. When any of us are caught in 
the snares of temptation and fall by the wayside, it not only hurts us 
individually but it hurts all of us. I pray that the Lord will continue 
to be mindful of us that we may be more loyal in the future than we have 
been in the past, loyal to our callings and to our responsibilities ; al- 
though we are growing in number, and today we seem to be present 
in goodly number, yet we are a handful, as it were, in the eyes of the 
world. We are only a few in number compared to the great host in the 



98 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



world, and we must remember and know that where the Lord requires 
responsibility, he expects us to be loyal and true to it. Therefore the 
responsibility is upon our shoulders as gathered Ephraim, living here 
in the land of Ephraim, in the tops of the mountains, in the midst of the 
everlasting hills, where the Lord has selected a gathering place and 
named it through the mouths of his holy prophets, both ancient and 
modern. "This is the place," and here it will be required at our hands, 
not only by our words but by our every day conduct. When we fall 
by the wayside the world sees us because their eyes are open upon us, 
and they are watching the actions and the words and conduct of 
the little handful of people that God has gathered into the mountain 
tops in these the last days. 

I pray that the Lord will continue to be watchful and mindful 
of this people, that we may be loyal and true and faithful and earnest, 
seeking day by day and laboring day by day to fulfil God's purposes, 
for where much is given much is required ; and with that love of the 
truth, with that testimony which has been in my heart ever since a 
youth, I pray that God will be mindful oi us and that he will continue to 
inspire, bless, sustain and honor those who are called to take the 
lead and to direct : that God's work may continue to grow, and that 
those to whom responsibility is given, in whom trust is imposed, may 
be loyal and true, and equal to the responsibility, and receive the bless- 
ings that the Lord has prepared for the faithful in the House of Israel 
in these the last days. 

May the Lord bless you, my brethren and sisters, in your homes, in 
your labors, in all your righteous undertakings, inspire you and give you 
faith, devotion, humility and power to know and do the will of God ; 
and by following the promptings of that "little Monitor"' within you, 
it is your right to know. And if you will listen and hearken unto its 
promptings, I promise you that you shall know, and shall have courage 
and faith to do the right and hold steadfast and true to the faith, that it 
shall not be necessary to go back and count your steps in regret; but 
rejoice in the blessings that have been promised to you as descendants 
of Father Abraham and especially the chosen of the Lord, being, most 
of us, of the house of Joseph or of the lineage of Ephraim who was 
especially chosen and especially blessed. May God help us to appreciate 
and live worthy of these blessings as they are being made plain to us 
every day of our lives. May the peace of the Lord be with us and be 
with his people wherever they are, whether gathered or scattered. I 
pray for these blessings ; and in the name of the Lord bless this great 
conference, — those who preside and those who hearken and listen, as 
members or as officers. May God bless you all according to your 
righteous needs, both temporally and spiritually, I pray in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS

ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 

I regard it as a distinctive honor to be invited to speak to this large 
congregation in this, the Sunday morning, session of our annual General 
Conference, where every seat is taken in this large tabernacle and hun- 
dreds of people are standing, eager as I suppose, to hear the word of 
the Lord as it shall fall from the lips of his servants. I realize that 
those who have assembled in conference are among the mast faithful 
of the Latter-day Saints. At the same time I realize that there are thou- 
sands of men and women in the Church who are just as faithful as 
those who are here assembled, but those who are of little faith are not 
wont to make great sacrifice to come to the meetings to hear the servants 
of the Lord. I do hope that by some means the excellent instruction 
which has been given during the sessions of this conference may reach 
that class of people. 

THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS ARE WELL TAUGHT 

In the primitive Church there were given officers for specific 
purposes, as there are officers given to the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints today: "And he gave some apostles, and some 
prophets ; and some evangelists ; and some pastors, and teachers ; 
for the perfection of the Saints, for the work of the ministry, 
for the edifying of the body of Christ, till we all come in the unity of 
the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man, 
unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ." The Latter-day 
Saints are well taught. We have the things of God as they have been 
'given through his servants in days that are past, recorded in these 
.standard works of the Church — the Holy Bible, the Book of Mormon, 
the Doctrine and Covenants and the Pearl of Great Price. These books 
are before the Latter-day Saints with a commandment of the Lord that 
we shall search them, for in them we think we have eternal life, and they 
are they which testify of God and of his truth. If we, the Latter-day 
Saints, were to read the scriptures as our Father in heaven desires that 
we should do, we would be better informed in regard to his mind and 
will concerning us. We would receive strength of spirit to live more 
fully the commandments which he has given us, and by the living of 
those commandments we would obtain the blessing of eternal life. It 
seems necessary that there should be officers and authorities in the 
Church to speak frequently of these things which are written, because 
we neglect to read them as we ought to. 

BY WORKS AND NOT BY FAITH ONLY ARE WE JUSTIFIED 

There is a proneness, I am sure, on the part of many of the Latter- 
day Saints, to be hearers of the word and to be satisfied without doing 
the things which the Lord has commanded us, which in our thoughtful 
moments we know are intended for our blessing and salvation. It was 
always so. When our Savior had finished, practically, his Sermon on 



100 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



the Mount, he reminded those whom he had been addressing, that not 
all those who cry, Lord, Lord, should be saved in the kingdom of heaven, 
but those who do the will of our Father in heaven, and he likened those 
who heard the word and would not do it unto a foolish man who built 
his house upon the sand, that when the rain descended and the floods 
came, and the winds blew and beat upon the house, it fell, and great 
was the fall thereof ; while those who heard and did the things which 
he taught were likened unto a wise man, who built his house upon the 
rock, that when the rain descended and the floods came and the winds 
blew and beat upon that house, it stood, for it was founded upon a rock. 

We find James, "the Just," and a "pillar" of the Church at Jeru- 
salem, teaching : 

"Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and 
receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls. 

"But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own 
selves." 

And further James said in explanation of this principle: 

"What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and 
have not works? Can faith save him? 

"If a brother or sister be naked and destitude of daily food, 

"And one of you say unto them, Depart ' in peace, be ye warmed and 
filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful 
to the body; what doth it profit? 

"Even so, faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone. 

"Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works; shew me thy 
faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works. 

"Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well; the devils also 
believe, and tremble. . 

"But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead.'' 

"Was not Abraham, our father, justified by works, when he had offered 
Isaac his son upon the altar? 

"Seest thou faith wrought with his works, and by works was taitft 
made perfect? _ , 

"And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed tjoa, 
and it was imputed unto him for righteousness; and he was called the friend 

° f ^°Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith 
only." 

TOO MUCH DEAD FAITH IN THE CHURCH 

Brethren and sisters, I feel that there is too much dead faith in the 
Church Those who have spoken in this conference, have a living faith 
in God and that which he has revealed, and they represent a large class 
of the Latter-day Saints. God bless them for their faith and faithful- 
ness ; but there is a great deal of dead faith, and those who possess it 
are deceiving themselves. 

Faith is the first principle of revealed religion, the foundation ot 
all righteousness. All our unrighteousness is due to the want of 
faith If we had the faith that we ought to have as Latter-day baints, 
there is nothing that need be done that we could not do. There is noth- 
ing that God has commanded us that we would not do; and we should 
remember that it is not the profession, it is not the intellectual assent 



ELDER GEORGE E. RICHARDS 



101 



unto principle, it is not the form that is going to save, it is the doing of 
the things which the Lord, through his gospel, has prescribed by which 
we may attain to glory and exaltation. Faith in itself will not save 
us. Knowledge in itself will not save us. Men have to have knowledge 
in order to be condemned as well as to be saved. The Latter-day Saints 
are well taught, I say, and if they will do as well as they know, they will 
obtain salvation; and if they do not do as well as they know, condemna- 
tion will certainly follow, for this gospel which we have received is 
as a savor of life unto life and of death unto death, unto those unto 
whom it comes. We have the authorities of the Church, they are here 
to explain to the children of men, in the Church and out of the Church, 
the things which are necessary to he done by them for their salvation, 
but men and women who will not obey the commandments of God when 
they hear them and understand them will scarcely be expected to be 
obedient unto the advice and counsel of the servants of God. Many 
there are, as I have already said, who will do so with glad hearts, and 
will reap the reward. I would to God that all the members of the 
Church would do so and be consistent and receive the blessings which 
our Father in heaven has so generously to give to his faithful children. 

NEED OF DOING THE THINGS WE KNOW 

We have need of being impressed with the necessity of doing the 
things which we know we ought to do, and by the preaching of the gos- 
pel we may be thus impressed. Then the Spirit of the Lord attends us, 
as it has done in the various sessions of this conference, the people who 
hear may, by that same Soirit, know that these things are of God, they 
know the voice of the Good Shepherd, even though it be manifest 
through his humble servants. The Lord has said : "Whether it be by my 
own voice, or by the mouth of my servants, it is the same," and the 
true and consistent Latter-day Saint regards it the same. Let me read 
in conclusion a few words : 

"And whatsoever they shall speak when moved upon by the Holy Ghost 
shall be scripture, shall be the will of the Lord, shall he the mind of the 
Lord, shall be the word of the Lord, shall be the voice of the Lord, and the 
power of God unto salvation." 

So we bear our testimony that we do speak, not of our own strength, 
and our own wisdom, but by the power of God made manifest by his 
Holy Spirit. I promise you that if you will heed the counsels which 
are given you by the servants of God, you will be walking in paths 
which are straight and which will make for joy, happiness and hope 
in this life, and eternal life in the world to come. I bear my testimony 
to you, my brethren and sisters, to this effect, in the name of the Lord 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir sang, "They that sow in tears shall reap in joy." 
The closing prayer was offered by Elder Junius F. Wells, and 
the Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock p. m. 



FIRST OVERELOW MEETING 



An overflow meeting of the Conference was held in the Assembly 
Hall at 10 o'clock, Sunday morning, April 8, 1923. There were close 
on to 4,000 people besides, at the Bureau of Information, who had 
gathered to hear the remarks that were made in the Tabernacle and 
transmitted to the outdoors by radio. 

In the Assembly Hall Elder Joseph Fielding Smith, of the Council 
of the Twelve, presided. 

The music and singing were furnished by the Jordan stake choir, 
under direction of Elder William M. Cox. 

The choir and congregation sang, "How firm a foundation, ye 
Saints of the Lord." 

The opening prayer was offered by Elder Elias A. Smith, of the 
High Council of the Liberty stake of Zion. 

A quartette and a chorus sang the anthem, "Grant us peace," by 
Evan Stephens. 

ELDER BRIGHAM S. YOUNG 

(President of the Northwestern States Mission) 

My dear brethren and sisters: It is with feelings of timidity that I 
stand before you, because, to a degree, I sense the responsibility of the 
position of a public instructor ; and that I may speak to you understand- 
ingly, and that there may be profit in what shall be said, I desire that 
my remarks may be dictated by the Spirit of God. 

It is a great privilege, brethren and sisters, to address a congrega- 
tion of the proportions of this one, and one that rarely comes to us — 
never in the field in which I am at present engaged. As I have the 
honor to preside over the Northwestern States mission, naturally I am 
deeply interested in missionary wonk. I am interested in the boys and 
girls, and we have at present seventy-seven in the Northwestern States 
mission, fifty-seven young men and twenty young ladies. I want to 
say to you that they are representative of the best men and women in 
all this Church, which means in all the world, for a finer, nobler, and 
more exemplary lot of young men and women it has never been my 
pleasure to know. 

I am deely interested in the youth of Zion, and have been so for 
many years. I have a large family myself. However, I am not in the 
class of my forebears, but I am interested in the youth of Zion, because 
I recognize this fact, that upon them depends the future of this work. 
The greatest possession, I believe, that it is possible for us to confer 
upon, or bequeath to, our children is a knowledge that this is the work 
of God, and to that end, brethren and sisters, I have a strong anxiety 
that your boys and girls should go into the mission fields, even though 
it may be at great sacrifice to yourselves. Those boys and girls, when 



ELDER BRIG HAM S. YOUNG 



103 



they return from a mission, if they have discharged its duties as are 
the boys and girls discharging their missions who are now in the field, - 
when they come back to you, you will find them men and women of 
power and inspiration, their intelligence immeasurably increased. If 
you would contribute the best that it is possible for you to contribute in 
your day and time, leave behind you a posterity who know that God 
lives. There is no higher achievement in this world, because it extends 
into eternity, than that the men and women, all of God's children, 
should know that he lives. The missionaries come back to your communi- 
ties, and we endeavor to teach them to return with the spirit of their mis- 
sion resting mightily upon them, that they may be a leaven in your com- 
munities for the dissemination of the spirit which they acquire and 
which, God willing, they may retain when they return to you. The 
future of this world depends upon these boys and girls, and it depends 
upon the strength of the testimony they shall acquire that this is God's 
work, and there is nothing you can give them that is of more value than 
the education, the finishing touches, the degree, that they shall acquire 
in the mission field when they have graduated in this great practical 
school of the* best there i.s in life. It teaches them that this is the work 
of the living God. Do not stint them, brethren and sisters ; send them 
on missions. You want them to be educated. There is no branch of 
education that better fits them for the practicabilities, the best, the 
highest things in life, than will a knowledge and a testimony of this, 
great work. This great fact should be borne in upon our consciousness, 
that we will get just what we earn and we will not get anything more. 
And your boys and girls will earn for themselves the best that can be 
conferred, if they will learn the fact that God has spoken and that he 
has established his Church. The Prophet Joseph Smith teaches us that 
the great thing to acquire is capacity. What have you capacity for? 
Are you prepared, through your educational attainments, to go into the 
society of the highly educated? If so, you can enjoy that atmosphere in 
which they live. If you have not been educated, you can not enjoy the 
atmosphere of education : and according to your capacity, that limits 
your power of enjoyment, of understanding, of intelligence, in the 
presence of God our Father, and if we, some of us, were to be trans- 
ported into his presence, it would be bad for us, because we could not 
endure his presence ; but these boys and girls are fitting themselves for 
these places that are to be occupied, not only in this world, but in the 
great hereafter. 

I am reminded of a dream that I heard a man relate. He said : 
"I dreamed that I had died, and I found myself on a great rocky plateau, 
a smooth shelf of rock ; on the right hand rose a precipice that was lost 
in the clouds. On the left hand was an abyss, the bottom of which 
Was lost in the mists which obscured it, and as I went along this 
great rocky shelf my attention was directed to a slight nodule on 
the surface of the rock sheet. As I approached it there issued from 
this nodule, which proved to be a cave, a little man, not more than half 



104 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

« 

I 

my height, and beckoning- to me he said : 'Come in here, I want to see 
where I am to send you,' and he took down, when I had entered his 
cavern, from a shelf on the rock, a little plaque that was about four 
by nine inches in dimension, and said : 'I will rub my hand over this 
plaque and your record will appear in points of light on its surface, and 
according to your record, there is where I will send you.' He rubbed 
his hand once over the plaque and a few points of light appeared. I 
looked over his shoulder with the utmost anxiety to see where I would 
be sent. He turned, when he had rubbed the stone once, and looked 
at me with very great significance. Again he passed his hand over the 
stone. There were a few more points of light and turning 
to me he said: 'It looks pretty bad for you, but I will rub my hand 
once more over the stone,' which he did, and when he had finished he 
put the stone back on its shelf and said to me: 'You won't do.' With 
that he picked me up with one hand and tossed me, into this abyss into 
which I sank to interminable depths. By and by I found my descent 
arrested. I stopped and began to rise slowly until I was on a level with 
the shelf from which I had been thrown. I continued to rise until I 
found myself in most beautiful surroundings. The trees were green, 
the grass, the flowers, the white bordered walks were beautiful. There 
were mansions on every hand, and as I traversed one of these splendid 
pathways I met a man whom I had known down below who had been 
a saloon bum. I said to him 'Why, Jack, how are you?' 
" 'Oh fine,' said he. 

"'What are you doing here?" I inquired. 
" 'Oh, this is where I belong,' he replied. 

"I hadn't gone very far before I met another, a card sharp. 'Why, 
Bill, what are you doing here ?' 

" 'Oh, this is where I belong and where you belong,' said he. 

"It was a beautiful place, but I met only that kind of men and 
women. And presently my attention was directed to a great height 
above me, which I could see with perfect distinctness, and I saw there 
my father, my mother, my friends, my loved ones, but I couldn't reach 
them because I had lived a life which entitled me only fo tne associa- 
tion of these men and women who surrounded me in this beautiful 
place, but which, compared with where my loved ones were, was poverty 
stricken, and mean and contemptible, and I knew that it was where I 
belonged, because I had lived such a life as entitled me only to go where 
I would have the society of such men as I had known and kept company 
with down on that earth from which we had come and where I had 
wasted opportunity." 

Your boys and girls, brethren and sisters, are fitting themselves 
for the highest, the best that God has to confer upon his children. 
Give them, above all things, a testimony that this is God's work, and 
you will give them what can not be destroyed here or hereafter, and 
rhey will live, and you will glory in, as will God, the records they have 
achieved here upon the earth. Let us be faithful to opportunity. This is 



ELDER BRIGHAM S. YOUNG 



105 



God's work, brethren and sisters. It can't be destroyed. It will live. Will 
we live with it? That God may help us to help ourselves, which is the 
vital thing, is my humble prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER SAMUEL O. BENNION 

(President of the Central States Mission) 

I desire to be led by the Spirit of the Lord in rtiy remarks this 
morning, and I trust that I may have your faith and prayers. This 
position is, to some extent, a difficult one, but inasmuch as I have 
been selected to take a part, I desire to say that which the Lord would 
have me say for the good of all who are here. 

There is no question in my mind concerning the truth of the 
gospel of Jesus Christ. I have learned by experience, through asso- 
ciation with men and women in the world, who know not the truth, and 
through my experience with men and women who have been sent into 
the world to preach the truth that there is power and genuineness and a 
spirit in this work in which we are engaged, which can not be found 
elsewhere in the earth. We would find this morning, if we had the 
privilege of visiting the great churches of the day, men and women, 
honorable men and women of the earth, gathered together, worshiping 
a God and believing in a God without a body, without parts, without 
passions, a great Spirit who fills the immensity of space and who sits 
enthroned in yonder heavens on the top of a topless throne. This is the 
conception of God held by many of the children of men, outside of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I haven't found in my 
experience any church which teaches, or representative of such who be- 
lieves, that our Father is a personal being and that we are created in his 
image. 1 have listened to one or two men not representing any church, 
who have made such statements. I know where the truth came from ; 
it came from our Father through Joseph Smith, the prophet of God. 
I have wondered just how long it would be before those who were dis- 
cussing the personality of God would recognize the inspiration and au- 
thority from which they took their remarks. This world is astray, so 
far as religion is concerned, and if it had not been for the revelations 
of the Father to Joseph the prophet, there never could have been any 
present salvation for the children of men, for man may worship God 
with all sincerity, believing that he is doing the right thing, but if he is 
worshiping in a way that is not ordained of the Lord, he can not receive 
the blessings of a glorified exaltation in the presence of that God who 
gave us life. There is one way only by which men may be saved and 
that is through obedience to law, and that obedience must be rendered 
by every man and every woman in the earth, or who has lived in the 
earth, or who will yet come to the earth, for salvation is predicated 



106 



GENERAL CONEERENCE 



on obedience to the principle and ordinance of repentance and baptism. 

We have some illustrations in holy writ covering these points ; for 
example, the story of the rich man and Lazarus. Lazarus was perse- 
cuted by the afflictions of the body ; he was poor so far as this 
world's goods were concerned; he suffered during his life and lived 
from the leavings of the rich man's table. We are told that in time 
he died and was carried by the angels to the bosom of Abraham, for he 
had served the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob ; had walked in that 
path which led him to Abraham, and Jesus told the Jews that Abraham 
was in the kingdom of God. In time the rich man died also, and he 
looked up and beheld Lazarus in the bosom of Abraham. He found 
that he himself was in torment ; he had not received what he expected. 
When he appealed to Abraham, Abraham told him that he had re- 
ceived in his earth life that which was a pleasure to him, that which his 
wealth had procured for him. He had wasted his time. He had not 
served God. whom he did not know. So this man's reward 
was a punishment unto him and he said to father Abraham : 
"Send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his fingers in 
water, and cool my tongue ; for I am tormented m this flame." But 
Abraham told him that where he was, Lazarus could not come, and 
where Lazarus was, he could not come: there was a great gulf that 
separated them. Lazarus in his day had overcome the wickedness of 
the world ; the other man had not, and in justice of God one was in 
torment and the other in the kingdom of God with Abraham, the father 
of the faithful, through whom all the nations of the earth were to be 
blessed. 

When the rich man discovered that he could not receive the bless- 
ings of Lazarus, he called Abraham to send some one to the earth to 
warn his brothers, five of them, that they might not be made partakers 
of his punishment, but Abraham said unto him : "They have Moses 
and the prophets. If they hear rot them neither will they be persuaded, 
though one rose from the dead." The law of Moses was in the earth ; 
the words of the prophets were there. There were men to administer 
the ordinances of the gospel and it was not the privilege of Abraham to 
send a man direct to those who were, undoubtedly, willfully neglecting 
their opportunity. 

These stories and these illustrations are given here in mortality and 
they apply to your life and mine, and give us to understand that, ac- 
cording to the things we learn and do in this world we shall be 
rewarded and be blessed and exalted in that great life which awaits the 
human family. Is it not our duty to stand by the commandments of 
God that we may have his Spirit, and that we may truthfully worship 
him and declare unto men and women who are in the world the true 
order of worship? 

For this is the day for men to prepare to meet their God. Escape 
from punishment hereafter is obtained through overcoming guilt in 



ELDER SAMUEL 0. BEN N I ON

mortality. The Lord appeared to men in this dispensation and gave 
a new and true order of worship and sent forth men into the earth to 
declare unto the children of men that they were in the depths of spiritual 
poverty and in the bonds of iniquity and there could not come to them 
a salvation and an exaltation in the presence of God except they would 
repent. 

The habits men sometimes form are of such a character that it 
takes the effort of a giant in spirit to overcome them. It is easy for 
men, honorable, as they may be, to believe that the Lord will give unto 
them all they desire. Why, they say, the thief on the cross, when he 
was put to death, at the time of the Redeemer's crucifixion, received a 
promise from, the Christ that he should that day be with him in 
paradise, and because of that they take it for granted that he went 
into the presence of the Father. But they have not read the scripture 
fully, as it is written, or they would readily understand that the thief 
did not receive a glory in the presence of the Father, fur we find re- 
corded also that the Christ, who suffered for the sins of the world, and 
was put to death in the flesh, was quickened by the Spirit, by which also 
he went and preached unto the spirits in prison which sometimes were 
disobedient when once the long suffering of God waited in the days of 
Noah, while the ark was preparing, wherein few, that is eight souls 
were saved by water. While his body lay in the tomb, the Savior 
preached the gospel to those who were dead. When he came back to the 
earth he was met by men and women, and particularly by Mary, who 
recognized him first and attempted to embrace him. But he said unto 
her : "Touch me not, for I ami not yet ascended to my Father ; but go to 
my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father and your 
Father and to my God and your God." 

If it were not for the revelations of our Father to his children 
through Joseph the prophet, in this dispensation, this body of people 
would be in the same condition that the w'orld is in, and take it for 
granted that the thief received an inheritance in the kingdom of God 
and that there is nothing to do but to repent, even though it be at the 
last moment of time. For this purpose the Lord revealed himself that 
the true order of worship might be instituted again among the children 
of men, that men and women, in their own time and enjoying free 
agency in mortality, away from home, as it were, might have the privi- 
lege, through the power which had been given unto them by that Father 
who sent them lo (he earth, of developing their character, which had its 
beginning before this earth was laid, or the foundation thereof ; that 
they might in time claim the privilege of association with their Father 
whom they had learned to love through keeping his laws and walking 
in his paths. From such doctrine there can be no appeal, neither can 
any one prove it untrue. I have failed in my experience in the mis- 
sion field, covering a period of nearly nineteen years, to find one man 
who has been able to disprove the logic of Joseph Smith the prophet, or 
who has ever proved untrue one single truth that came through Joseph 



108 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



the prophet to us in our day. On the contrary, everything that has been 
taught has stood the test. Men and women have been brought to a 
knowledge of the truth and deception has vanished and the adversary 
has not the power that he had in the earth in the days of the coming 
forth of this great Latter-day work. The Priesthood, the power of 
God, is in the earth ; the power to explain and expound the scripture 
is vested in men, and Lucifer, neither by mob law, nor by an attack of 
the learned upon the truth, nor in any other way, has ever been able to 
prove untrue the statements made constantly by the elders of Israel. 
Show me the man, regardless of who he is, who can prove from holy 
writ that God our eternal Father is without form) and without body, 
parts or passions. Let him write or teach if to the children of men 
and I promise him, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, that he will 
prove that he himself is wrong and that the Church of Jesus Christ 
is right in its doctrines and in its teachings. Why, the glory that comes 
through the knowledge of this gospel, can never be measured by the 
mind of men in mortality who do not know the truth. 

I want to say to you, in conclusion, I think there is not a single 
person who has the interest of a boy and a girl at heart but who desires 
and really prays and hopes that they may have the privilege of going 
into the mission field and bearing testimony of this truth. The truth 
makes men free, makes men strong and absolutely keeps them from 
being overcome by all the sophistries that are brought to bear against 
the true order of worship; and bearing testimony of it qualifies a boy 
or girl for a future that can not be purchased with money, that can be 
purchased only by real experience. Boys and girls will never learn at 
home to discuss and preach the gospel as they do away from home, 
for the spirit of opposition is not found here. They do not find here 
men who rise up from every corner and say : I don't believe your 
doctrine. They have not that chance at home, but out in the mission 
field they have that opportunity. 

When you look into the faces of people, bond or free, black or 
whke, anywhere in the earth, remember one thing;, that they kept their 
first estate to the extent that the)' had the privilege of coming into the 
world and having the chance of keeping their second estate. We who 
have received the gospel, owe it to them every moment of our time, 
to labor with them, not to fight them; to show them the true order 
of worship ; to pray for them, to plead for them. Out of the mission 
fields of the earth in the la,st few years have come some of the most 
wonderful men and women that are found in the earth, whose testimony 
is as great and as sure as those who have been reared in the vallevs 
of the mountains. I tell you we owe it to them, or in the day of judg- 
ment we may be called to account for a neglect of duty, when we had 
the money and the property that would have taken the message to a 
man or a woman who has not had the privilege of receiving it, and can 
not have that privilege until he has obeyed the law. 

I want to say to the Latter-day Saints, in your triumphs, or in 



ELDER SAMUEL 0. BENNION

the times of adversities, don't forget that the preaching of the gospel 
is the life of your boy or your girl, and that it will give them a better 
training than anything else that can be found. I have a son in the 
mission field in Old Mexico. I would rather he would be there than in 
any school in the country during a certain period of his life. I have 
had the privilege of having in my mission more than two thousand mis- 
sionaries. I want to say to you it is the greatest experience I ever had. 
No school could measure up to it. Those who have been missionaries 
are better qualified to enter into colleges of the country. They are 
more reliable, surer, better men, better women in judgment. I tell you 
this gospel is the perfect law of liberty. The words of the Savior are 
true ; they apply unto these boys and girls and to all of us. He said unto 
his disciples : "If ye continue in my word, then ye are indeed my 
disciples, and ye shall know the truth ; and the truth shall make you 
free." And may God give us the power and the privilege and the faith 
and the protection to worship him in .spirit and in truth, and be free 
so that we may be able to stand for him forever, I pray in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH QUINNEY, JR. 

{President of the Canadian Mission) 

My dear brethren and sisters. If there was ever a time in my life 
when I was in need of the power of the Spirit of God it is at present. 
As I have sat and listened during the sessions of this conference to the 
many testimonies that have been given by the brethren who have occu- 
pied the time, I have been convinced more and more of the greatness 
of the wonderful institution of which we have become members. I have 
been convinced more than ever before as I have listened to these testi- 
monies that this great Latter-day work deals with and provides for 
the material as well as the spiritual salvation of the children of men. 

I have had the honor of being called to preside over one of the 
great missions of the Church. During the last month I have been 
introduced into the various conferences comprising the Canadian mis- 
sion, in connection and in company with President Nephi Jensen, who 
preceded me in this work. He has been generous in his introduction of 
me into the different branches, to the different elders, to the Saints 
and to the people of that great dominion. I want to say here that 
President Jensen and his wife have indeed done a glorious work, have 
laid a splendid foundation upon which to build in that great country. 
It has been my privilege to visit nearly all of the missions of the Church 
in the world, but I believe that I can say without any fear of contra- 
diction that my introduction now into the mission field has brought 
me in contact with young men and women who are more desirous 
of promulgating this great and mighty truth, the gospel of Jesus Christ, 



110 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



in power and in strength to those with whom they come in contact, than 
any others I have met at any other time of my life. I have found during 
my lahors among them for this short period of time a most splendid 
attitude, a fine spirit. 

They are actuated by a strong desire of equipping themselves with a 
knowledge and with a testimony of this great and mighty work, and I 
feel to praise God, my eternal Father, for the opportunity that has 
come to me in being worthy of carrying this great message of truth 
to an unbelieving world, to leave with them my testimony concerning 
the divinity of this work. I am grateful to God, my eternal Father, 
that he has permitted me to come in contact with elders who are im- 
bued with the Spirit of our heavenly Father. When I associate with 
them and witness their dispositions in proclaiming this gospel and their 
endeavor to have a testimony come to them concerning the divinity of 
this work, I want to tell you that it is worth all the means, all the money 
and all the time, that one can give in listening to these young men and 
women bear their testimony concerning the divinity of this great and 
mighty work. I have known them, when they have received this 
testimony, to testify that God lives ; that the fulfilment of the prophecy 
has taken place that came to John the Revelator while he was upon 
the Isle of Patmos, namely, that Irs vision was opened, and he made 
this proclamation in the way of prophecy to the generations of 
all time, that he saw another angel flying through the midst of heaven 
having the everlasting gospel to preach to them that dwell upon the 
earth, to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people. These 
young men and women bear this testimony with power and strength that 
can not be misunderstood, and when they take it with the spirit of 
humility and prayer into the homes of the honest in heart there comes 
a joy unspeakable, because it is taken there with that conviction that 
those who listen to them mistake not, and many there are now who 
are accepting this humble testimony and the message they have to bring. 

My brethren and sisters, to me there is nothing so fine and beauti- 
ful as knowing that this is the work of God. There is nothing so 
beautiful and .so fine as feeling that it is the work of God, and when I 
read of and hear repeated, time and time again, the visitation of the 
Angel Moroni to the Prophet Joseph Smith, there comes to me a 
testimony that there is nothing in the gospel of Christ that is negative, 
but on the other hand everything is positive. If we analyze carefully 
each visit that this angel made to the Prophet Joseph Smith we will 
discover that he was absolutely positive in the message that he deliv- 
ered to him. The second time that he came to him, we are told that the 
words were identical with the first message that was delivered to him ; 
likewise the third message ; all were repeated with the same power, with 
the same authority, with the same influence, the same glory, that it con- 
vinced to that extent the Prophet Joseph Smith that he was to be used 
as the instrumentality in bringing about the restoration of the gospel 
of Jesus Christ. And it seems to me, as I read and hear these things 



ELDER JOSEPH QUINNEY, JR. 



Ill 



repeated, that so positive was the angel Moroni in the delivery of this 
message that he wanted to impress more perfectly upon the mind of this 
young man the importance of this latter-day work, that he appeared to 
him again the following day and gave him the exact message that he 
had given him the night previous with the same power and the same 
authority that there was no mistaking any message that he did deliver 
and the purpose of it. 

My hrethren and sisters, I want to bear my testimony today that I 
know, as I know that I live, that God, my eternal Father, lives and that 
Jesus Christ is his only begotten Son in the flesh. I stand here as a 
living manifestation of his great and mighty power. Had it not been 
for the Priesthood of God it would not have been my privilege to live 
upon the earth at this time and I feel that there is an obligation resting 
upon me, as a servant of Almighty God, to leave a testimony wherever 
I go, wherever the opportunity affords to give it to the children of 
men; and I know, with just as much certainty as I know that God lives, 
that Joseph Smith was his prophet, that he was used as the instru- 
mentality of God in establishing this great and mighty work here upon 
the earth in this day and time, and blessed is he or she who has the 
opportunity and the privilege of taking this gospel of Jesus Christ into 
the nations of the earth. 

God bless us to the end that we will cherish the testimonies that 
have been given to us during this conference that we might devote our 
time and our talent and all that we have in the establishment of God's 
mighty purposes upon this earth, is my prayer in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen.

ELDER JOHN H. TAYLOR 

(President of the Northern States Mission) 

I am grateful for the gospel of Jesus Christ and the testimony that 
has come to me of the truth of the same. In these days of doubt, 
in these days of wandering to and fro, searching after truth, I am 
grateful that we have in the gospel of Jesus Christ the truth, the thing 
that counts and makes it possible for us to go back into the kingdom 
of God, provided we live the lives we should live here upon the earth. 

These men who are telling us that there is no divinity in the Lord 
and Savior Jesus Christ are trying to wreck the faith of the people 
of the earth. These men who go around telling us that the truths which 
are written in the holy scriptures are nothing but foolishness, and are 
so chi'dish that men of intelligence should pay no attention to them, 
are also trying to destroy faith in God's work and Church. I am glad 
that we have no apologies to make to anybody about the kingdom of 
God, the Church of Jesus Christ. We are not ashamed to accept the 
divinity of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. We are not ashamed 



112 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



to accept the holy scriptures that were given to us by holy prophets 
through the inspiration of God. We are engaged in the great work of 
carrying this message to the people. Sometimes we rather feel that in 
the early days of the Church we had such glorious, powerful mission- 
aries, which we did have, but sometimes, it seems to me, that we rather 
feel that the day of such missionary spirit and work are of the past. 
I want to bear testimony that the spirit of that kind of missionary work 
is still in the hearts of the boys and girls who are out preaching the 
gospel in the world today. It abides with them to the same extent that 
it did formerly and they are the same kind of faithful, humble men 
and women who are preaching the word today, as preached it in the 
early days of the Church. 

I am grateful for the auxiliaries of our Church. They may not 
always show the great results that we have anticipated, but I want to 
tell you that the auxiliaries of the Church are making and bringing 
into the hearts of the boys and girls a desire to be clean, a courage and 
a faith to accept the call of God to go out and preach his gospel unto 
the people, making them feel that they should give their time and 
their energy in carrying the glad tiding of great joy to the people, sow- 
ing into their hearts the precious seeds of truth. As they go out into the 
missionary world, those seeds grow and grow rapidly, and the mis- 
sionaries stand bdfore the people bearing testimony of the truth 
of God's work. These men and women are finding God because 
they are seeking God ; they are knocking at the door, and the door is 
being opened ; they are searching and they are finding, and as we go to 
God, so God does answer our faith, and prayers, and permits us to 
know for ourselves the truth of this great and precious gospel 
of Jesus Christ. What wonderful testimony our boys and girls are 
finding out in the world. One boy, one humble boy, called at a home 
with some of his associates to administer to a woman who had a large 
swelling on her neck. After the administration the boy wrote to his 
mother and said: "Why, mother, when we took our hands from off 
her head, you could see the swelling going down. No one can tell me, 
in the future, that there are not miracles in these latter days." What a 
glorious testimony. Talk about the need of your boys and girls in the 
home ; it is not comparable with the things that the boys and girls are 
learning about God the eternal Father in the mission field. Let them 
remain as long as possible. Let them come into the field ; because of 
their humility God will fill their hearts with a testimony of the gospel 
of Jesus Christ. Not only are the boys and girls learning about God, 
but they are finding out about their fathers and mothers at home. When 
they are young, they some time go away from home for the night and 
they come back next day homesick, for their fathers and mothers. 
Sometimes now our boys and girls are homesick for their fathers 
and their mothers ; the first time perhaps that they have been homesick 
for you for a long while, homesick because you have again come into 
their life, you have a point of contact and they want their fathers and 



ELDER JOHN H. TALYOR 



113 



their mothers. As we talk to them in their little rooms, these boys 
and girls of yours tell us about their fathers and mothers at home, and 
they are grateful for such men and women as you. I hope that we will 
keep in close touch with our boys and girls, so that being far from us 
or near by, they shall always be anxious and homesick for us. For 
while they are in 'this condition, they will be safer and sweeter and 
cleaner in the sight of God. A young man was lying on his deathbed, 
with his father as his side. The father asked him if there was anything 
that he could do for him. The boy replying said, "Yes, after I am gone, 
I wish you would bury me in the field by that big tree." And the father 
asked him what he wanted to be buried in the field for, and the boy 
said: "Why, you know, father, you are down in the field most of 
the time, and I want to be near you." What a precious thing to have 
our boys and girls loving us so much that they are always wanting to 
be near us ! What a glorious privilege it is to send our boys and girls 
out as messengers of truth into the world ! 

May God bless us; may he help us; may we be faithful, retain a 
faithful testimony of his gospel in our hearts, and may we lead the 
lives we should, I humbly ask in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER ANGUS T. WRIGHT 

{Newly Appointed President pf the New Zealand Mission) 

It seems unnecessary for me to say that it is a great pleasure to 
be with you this morning in the service of the Lord. While I look 
upon your faces and recognize very few of you as acquaintances, yet 
I feel and know that you are my brethren, you are my sisters, in that 
great cause which has been revealed in these last days. 

I rejoice in this work, I rejoice to know that I have been counted 
worthy to be called to go forth again to carry this glad message to 
the nations of the earth. Thirty odd years ago I was called to New 
Zealand . When I was called I hardly knew where New Zealand was. 
I had to get a map to find out, and when I got that map I found a small 
spot away off in the south Pacific Ocean, seven or eight thousand miles 
away, and it seemed an awful long way from home, but 1 was called to 
that mission. I never questioned for a moment but what it was a call 
of the Lord. His servants had called me; his servants had laid their 
hands upon my head and blessed me. They told me that I should go in 
peace and return in safety, and I believed as firmly in that promise as I 
believed that the sun would rise upon the morrow. I had several 
narrow escapes while there, but God blessed me with his Spirit, he 
preserved me in health, he preserved me in strength ; he blessed me that 
I was able to perform, to some extent, the mission that was expected of 
me. 

Before leaving my home a rather peculiar thing happened to me. 



114 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



President Lewis W. Shurtliff, then president of our stake, said : "Broth- 
er Wright, I desire to give you a blessing before you leave." And I 
told him I should be very glad indeed to have it, and he, with my father- 
in-law, Charles F. Middleton, came to my home, and President Shurt- 
liff blessed me, adding, as has been stated by the brethren previously, 
when I was set apart, that I should go in peace and return in safety, 
but he made this additional promise. He said: "You snail go and 
assist in the translation of the Book of Mormon." Now, I didn't know 
that the Book of Mormon was being translated. He, no doubt, had 
heard of it, but I remembered that promise, and when I landed in 
Auckland, with seven other elders, and was met by President Paxman, 
he selected me from that entire number to go down to that particular 
part of the island where this work was being done by Brother Ezra 
Richards, of Farmington, and another brother from Salt Lake City, 
and while there I had the privilege of assisting as scribe. I read the 
manuscript, that had been corrected, to Sister Marriott who rewrote it 
for the brethren. And afterwards I was called to go to Auckland and 
there I proof read and published the Book of Mormon in the Maori 
language. Now, it was a rather convincing thing to me that President 
Shurtliff should make this promise to me, at that special time and that 
President Paxman, who had no way of knowing of this particular 
promise, should select me from that number to go to that particular part 
of the island and assist, as had been promised, and it was surely a 
testimony to me that, at least, I had been called by the proper spirit. 
There was no question in my mind when I was called whether I would 
go, or not. Sure, I didn't know where I was going. Some of my out- 
side friends, and I had a lot of them, said, "Well, there are cannibals 
down there, but there is one satisfaction for them in eating you ; they 
will get a whole mouth-full because you arc built that way." 

But they didn't eat me. However, we met cannibals. I met 
one old gentleman in particular who admitted to me that he had been 
a cannibal, and he told me that the flesh was sweet and very much 
like pork, so there you are! 

I was somewhat surprised, I will admit, at this second call. I 
will say, however, that I also had the privilege of presiding, the last 
year of my mission there, as I relieved President Paxman, who was 
released to return home, and 1 had the privilege of directing the labors 
in that mission for one year, but it is thirty-three or thirty-four 
years since, and I am getting old, so they tell me. That is the only 
objection that anybody has ever made to my present call, they thought 
I was getting too old, but 1 can not realize that. I feel yet that I am 
only a kid, and my mind is just as alert — I couldn't ride a horse just 
as well as I did then. I couldn't, perhaps, walk just as far as we had to 
sometimes, but otherwise I feel just as capable, just as alert, just as 
much filled with that desire and that ambition and that Spirit of God, 
as I ever have been in my life, so I think these friends who would like 



ELDER ANGUS T. WRIGHT 



115 



lo relieve me on account of my age are mistaken. 1 don't feel that 1 
am in that class at all. 

When President Ivins spoke to me about going, he said my name 
was under consideration, several have been named, but he said, "I can 
not get my mind on anybody else but you." President Ivins and I 
had 1 the privilege of laboring togther on the State Board of the 
Agricultural College as trustees, and he said : "I have become pretty 
well acquainted with you in these past five or six years, and you, hav- 
ing been tbere must yet remember part of the language. I feel that you 
are the proper man. Will you go?" "Why," I said, "President Ivins, 
you should not ask me that question. You ought to know that I will 
go, and with pleasure." "Well, but," he said, "you are a business man, 
and if it will interfere in any way with your business, with your finan- 
cial affairs, and you feel that you can not go, say the word and we will 
find someone else." "President Ivins, all that I have belongs to God, 
and I am only his steward. I haven't so very much, but what I have 
is on the altar and at your service. What few years I have left, if 
necessary, I am willing to devote to this great cause, which I know 
is true," and he gave me his hand, and the shake of that hand that 
I got at that time I never will forget, and the spirit that I seemed 
to receive from him has been with me ever since. I used to be afraid, 
1 used to be nervous. I used to take a back seat. I admit business men 
usually are a little backward about coming forward, but since that day, 
why, it has been a pleasure to come and speak, it has neen a pleasure 
for me to pray, it has been a pleasure for me to meet with the Saints, 
and I have taken more joy and satisfaction in this short month, or 
month and a half, than 1 have for many years, and it is a testimony 
to me that it is the work of God. My wife, God bless her, is going with 
me. She is not quite as old as I am, and don't look nearly as old. She 
is not as white-haired as I, but she has been spared for some good 
purpose. She has been ill, she has had serious operations, but today 
she seems to be in perfect health, and I can't help but believe, and 
she believes, that she has been spared for some good purpose. She is 
a noble woman. I say it sometimes in her presence, and I say it here, 
because I know she is over in the other building, but she is a noble 
beinc. She will make a mother to those elders, as she said last night. 
We had a li'tle meeting telling us goodby, and she was asked to speak. 
She said: "1 will be a motber to ihose bovs, and if thev get holes in 
their s'ockings T will help them darn them," and she will; she is built 
that way ; she is a perfect mother. 

Now I must not take up to much time, but I assure you that T 
feel to rejoice. I feel my weakness in being classed with these veterans 
who have been in the field, as Brother T'ennion savs, for nine f een 
vears, while I have been trying to accumulate dollars, he has been 
laying up his treasures in heaven; mine are where thieves sometimes 
break through and steal, but I am willing, my brethren and sisters, to 
spend part of that little in the service of the Lord. I feel to rejoice. 



116 , GENERAL CONFERENCE 



I know that we are going in safety and we are going to return like- 
wise, because we have been promised. Not only that — let me say, just 
to be exact, a rather peculiar incident happened. The occasion that 
I spoke of when President Ivins first asked me if I would go was on 
Friday, February 16. On Friday, March 9, President Grant called 
nie on the phone and confirmed this call, and asked if 1 could go, and I 
said, as I told President Ivins, "Brother Grant, you know I will go. 
While I am weak, while I am not a preacher, I am willing to devote 
my time, and if God will help me and with the prayers of you good 
brethren, I feel that I shall succeed." That is the great satisfaction for 
me. No matter which one of the apostles I have met, or any of the 
other authorities of the Church, they have shaken me by the hand and 
said: "Brother Wright, I believe you are the right man in, the right 
place; we have confidence in you." And oh, what a joy, what else on 
earth could give one so much joy, so much joy to know that one has the 
faith, the confidence, the love, the respect and esteem of these good 
men, and I say, God bless them. But, getting back, I have said now, 
there are two Fridays, Friday, February 16, Brother Ivins spoke to 
me; Friday, March 9, Brother Grant confirmed the call. On Friday, 
mind you again, we were set apart, and we sail on Friday, in a room or 
cabin numbered 13. You cannot tell me but what we are going in 
safety, and we are coming in like manner, after all that, because all 
these negatives must make a positive. 

It is almost time to close, and I regret it, because I have a lot more 
I would like to say to you. I certainly received a great testimony of 
the truth of the gospel when I was in the field before. I did not know 
the power that was within me as a servant of God. In one field that 
we were opening up, the power of darkness preceded us. It took pos- 
session of a weak sister, and tried to confound us, to prevent us from 
opening up this mission on this adjacent isle. It was in the form of a 
man. He talked to me through this sister. He told me his name, that he 
was a cannibal, that he was a bad man, that he was there with thou- 
sands with him, and they were going to prevent us from opening up that 
mission, he was going to prevent these people whom he called his 
from, entering into the waters of "Mormon" to be baptized. But by the 
power of the holy Priesthood, by the authority of Jesus Christ, we 
rebuked that evil influence, that evil spirit, and we w r ere enabled to 
go forth and perform the ordinances of baptism to thirty-five of them; 
we blessed fifteen children ; we organized a branch, and we left them 
happy and contented, and I know it was by the power of the Priest- 
hood of God, and I have rejo ; ced in that testimony ever since. 

May God bless you, my brethren and sisters. I hope you will 
remember us sometimes, in that far-off land, and I know that the 
prayers of the faithful accomplish much, and we sincerely ask for 
them. And I bear you my testimony, my brethren and sisters, that 
I know and am satisfied that this is the work of God. Why, look ! who 
could deny it, when you see its effects? You shall know a tree by its 



ELDER ANGUS T. WRIGHT

fruits. See how Zion is growing. Go into any of the branches, or 
the wards, see the interest that is being taken. They are crowded as 
never before. We are dividing our stakes and sub-dividing our wards, 
and yet wour meetinghouses will hardly hold the Latter-day Saints be- 
cause of that great awakening, the great spirit, the great desire, to serve 
God, which seems to have come literally upon them, and I rejoice in it, 
and may God bless us, I ask it in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem; "Gospel Restoration," with Mrs. Mark 
Gardner, soloist. 

Benediction was pronounced by Elder George Durham. 
Meeting adjourned until 2 o'clock p. m. 



SECOND OVERFLOW MEETING 

A second overflow meeting was held in the Assembly Hall in the 
afternoon at 2 o'clock, April 8, 1923. President Seymour B. Young, 
of the First Council of Seventy, presided. 

The Jordan stake choir, William M. Cox, director, furnished the 
music and singing. 

The choir sang the anthem, "Holy Temple" as the opening num- 
ber. 

Prayer was offered by Elder Joseph Kimball. 

The services were continued by the choir singing the anthem, "The 
Victory." 

ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 

(Of the Presiding Bishopric) 

"No one can assist in this work except he shall be humble and full 
of love, having faith, hope and charity, being temperate in all things." 

I am sure, my brethren and sisters, that those of us who have been 
fortunate enough to attend this conference and to hear the testimonies 
of the men who are on the firing line of this work, have rejoiced in 
the words spoken, for their words have been filled with love and the 
spirit of truth and humility. They have manifested a desire to labor 
willingly and unselfishly for the advancement of truth and righteousness. 
I sincerely pray that for the few moments I stand before you, I may be 
blessed of God, that the words I utter may be guided by his Holy Spirit. 

It is a great responsibility to stand before the Latter-day Saints 
in conference assembled, and attempt to instruct them concerning their 
duties, or to expound principles of the gospel. I have been very much 
concerned for some time past and have tried to fix my mind upon some 
particular subject upon which I might be especially prepared, should 
I have the privilege of addressing the conference. Each speaker has 
given to me some thought, but not until today was I fully impressed 



118 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



that, as your servant, one upon whom rests the responsibility of helping 
to look after the temporal affairs of the Church, 1 should speak concern- 
ing these matters. 

Fortunately for me, I am a son of the soil, put to work in my 
youth tilling the ground to help provide food for a large family ; one 
of the greatest experiences that can come to one. President Hinckley's 
remarks concerning the many opportunities to be found on the farm, 
recalled to my mind a picture of the conditions in the stakes of Zion 
as I have seen them, having had the privilege of visiting all but a very 
few. I think I can see an opportunity for greater development, for 
great cooperation and for the manifestation of the spirit of love in a 
greater degree. 

I am happy to find myself in harmony with the remarks of Presi- 
dent Grant. I am reminded that those who have made a life study 
of agriculture tell us that in our country, especially in the valleys where 
sugar beets can be raised, we have an ideal condition for farming. 
We have not as yet taken advantage of it. We are farming too much 
land, taking from the soil our inheritance and sending it away for 
a mere pittance, and like a shiftless man who has had left to him 
a fortune, we forget that some day it may be used up, and go on day 
after day eating into the principal. Think of sending hay and other 
bulky products away from our farms, thus reducing the strength of 
the soil. We are told that the condition ideal is one wherein we may 
raise alfalfa, grain, corn for insilage and beets. These cultivated and 
cover crops fed to the dairy cow, the beet pulp being returned, preferably 
in the dry state after the sugar has been extracted, provide fertilizers 
that increase these crops year by year. Milk anil eggs sold each day 
provide monthly cash income to maintain the family, and sugar beets 
provide means for taxes and general expenses. 

Many times have 1 gone onto the farms and found the poor old 
cow picking up that which had been left from the horses, and 1 
remember one time going into one yard where I found four big cows, 
all four not giving more milk than one should give. I asked the owner 
why he did not get one good cow to provide milk for his family. "Well, 
it is too much bother to look after them. When these go dry I can turn 
them out on the range and go out and get a fresh one," was his reply. 
That man has never learned what it means to one to really love a cow. 
They will respond and will pay handsomely for kind treatment, but if 
left to stand in the wet and muck to their knees in the winter-time with- 
out shelter, we can not expect them to make a profit, for their feed 
must go to keep them warm and sometimes to keep life in them. 

Last spring, while on the way to attend a stake conference, I met 
a man on the train who said he had decided that no farm could be 
a success without dairy cows, and he was on his way to my des^'vation 
for the purpose of buying dairy cows. I was surprised, knowing that the 
farmers of that district were depending largely upon range cattle, very 
few of them milking cows. After the conference I had a half day 



ELDER DAVID A. SMITH. 



119 



to wait for my train. I visited the implement dealer, the banker, the 
storekeeper, and found that the men who had the best credit were those 
who were milking cows. These were few, but they had learned the 
lesson and had no milch cows for sale. 

I am wondering if farming has not been too easy for us. To milk 
cows is confining. To look after poultry, for many of us is beneath 
our dignity, and we dislike to berried down in this way. The sale of 
milk, eggs, poultry, hogs, when properly marketed, brings cash returns. 
Nearly all of these are by-products of the cow. Hay, grain, ensilage, 
beet pulp, fed to cows, carefully bedded with the straw produced, pro- 
vides a fertilizer wh'ch, when put back into the soil enriches it and 
provides strength for increased crops. It seems to me only a matter of a 
short time until these conditions will be forced upon us as they have been 
in other paris of the country. 

Let us stop sending our hay and other crops containing the life of 
the soil away from the farm. Many times over the ra'lroad, paying 
a high freight, when that same produce could be sent out in butter, 
cheese, milk, eggs and sugar, bringing a greater return and increasing 
the invested capital of all concerned. 

Complete success cannot come through individual efforts. We 
must have cooperation. We must work unitedly for the welfare of all 
and not selfishly for our indivdual interests. I would like to see the 
time come when we can be filled with the spirit of love, every man 
feeling in his soul that success for him should mean success for his 
neighbor. President Ivins said this morning, we cannot look after the 
spiritual, leaving the temporal body to die, nor can we look only after 
the temporal, leaving the spiritual body to die; they must go hand in 
hand. The average production for this intermountain country, of sugar 
beets is eleven tons to the acre. I saw a farm a year ago where they 
raised twenty-three tons of sugar beets to the acre and across the road 
from this place was another where only ten tons were produced to the 
acre. These are conditions which must have attention if we hope to 
succeed. If every farmer who planted sugar beets last year had 
increased his crop one ton per acre, (as he could have done by fertilizing 
his soil and properly preparing his ground) it would mean nearly one 
million dollars for th's people. 

Now I see that my time is up. I pray, my brethren and sisters, that 
when we go to our homes we will not be content to labor selfishly 
in our own way, but that we will look about us and ascertain the 
wishes and desires of our neighbors, that we meet with them and plan 
with them and work wi h them to do that which will be for the greatest 
good of all, remembering that to be successful temporally and spirit- 
ually we must have in our souls the spirit of love, filled with faith, hope 
and charity ; faith in Gcd ; fai h in h s promises and his works ; faith in 
tascl 'and faith in ourselves; hope for the future; charity, not a mere 
giving of means but that everlasting, enduring charity, that "charity 
that suf fereth long and is kind, that envieth not, vaunteth not itself, and 



120 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



is not puffed up — that charity that does not behave itself unseemly, 
seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, and thmketh no evil, re- 
joice'h not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth." 

Under these conditions it will not be difficult for us to know and 
be influenced by the Spirit of the Lord. Under this condition, working 
hand in hand with one another, we will be in a position to receive the 
blessings of God, promised to his children. And I fully believe that 
many blessings have been withheld from us as a people because of ou,r 
unwillingness to labor unitedly, both for our temporal and spiritual 
welfare. God give us strength, wisdom, and love that we may go on and 
on in the great work in that fellowship that should be found in this 
Church, T pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JOHN WELLS 

(Of the Presiding Bishopric) 

No doubt all have been deeply impressed with the variety of sub- 
jects that have been presented during this conference. It seems to be 
the sincere desire of all the speakers to bless, advise, counsel and instruct 
Latter-day Saints to reach a higher plane, both in temporal and spiritual 
development. The music has been inspiring. It, no doubt, has reached 
our very souls and has been sung by those who feel what they sing. 
The music of the Latter-day Saints is not hired to create effect, but is 
a part of the congregational worslrp. . 

It is not what we hear that benefits us so much as the thoughts which 
sink deep into our soul, that ring out, not only in our ears, but which 
become part of our life'.s habit that will benefit us. If we take home with 
us the counsel and instructions we have received, and develop in our 
hearts a fixed determination to follow that counsel and make it a part 
of our daily life, we shall develop as the Lord expects us to. 

On Friday, President Heber J. Grant referred to the great mis- 
sionary work of the Church. He stated there were 1,775 men and 
women laboring in the, nations of the earth and in this great country 
without any hope of earthly reward. They are suffering trials and 
sometimes distress that would appall ordinary persons. They go from 
door to door with the messages of the gospel, frequently have these 
doors shut in their faces ; in many cases they struggle to acquire an- 
other language. The Lord blesses them so abundantly in] his labor and 
ministry that in a few weeks or months they are able to do what others 
have not been able to do in years, that is, express themselves in a 
foreign tongue. And it has been a constant comment and marvel to the 
people of the world of the rapidity with which the Latter-day Saints 
acquire a foreign language. 

Many people have an idea that success in life is measured by 
dollars and cents ; others by the acquisHion of lands and cattle and 
sheep ; others by the accumulation of stocks and bonds. But there is 



ELDER JOHN WELLS 



121 



in the gospel something far more substantial, far more important than 
success measured by dollars and cents or the things of the world. And 
one outstanding feature of the Latter-day Saints is the great work that 
is being done by its missionaries in all parts of the world ; by their ex- 
emplary lives they teach the world that there is something in "Mormon- 
ism" different to other religions. The leaven of the gospel is slowly 
vitalizing the theories of men concerning Christianity. Not only that, 
there is the great development that comes to the missionaries themselves. 
They may come home without the gratification of having made con- 
verts, but they do a wonderful work for themselves . by obtaining a 
testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the most priceless thing a man 
or woman can obtain. 

It is not necessary that the Latter-day Saints should measure 
their success in the world by the numbers who embrace the gospel, 
although it is always gratifying to know that others have received with 
glad hearts the message of the gospel that has come to us. But the 
Father, when he appeared to the Prophet Joseph, thought one man was 
enough to show himself to, that he might be a new witness for God. 

I was talking with a man the other day who had just received a 
letter from his son, breathing the spirit and power of the gospel. The 
father said : "Yes, that one letter alone has paid me for all the labor, 
the expense and all the effort that we have made to keep that boy in 
the mission field." Let us keep a constant stream of young men and 
women in the missionary field. Let every ward do its full share in 
warning the world by sending missionaries to proclaim the gospel mes- 
sage. Let us not measure the work of the Lord in terms of a pocket- 
book, but measure it in terms of eternal life that will come to our young 
people who perform their part and remain true to the covenant of the 
gospel. 

Perhaps I ought to say something on temporal things, for my 
duty and calling is to minister in all temporal things. President Grant 
has more than once expressed his desire that the Latter-day Saint should 
get out of debt. We are on the eve of another era of prosperity. 
Whether is is permanent or not only time can tell. The nations of 
Europe are still struggling and trying to lift their heads out of the chaos 
caused by war. They are unable to purchase the necessities of life, 
much more import luxuries, and even necessities from other countries. 
Our present wave of prosperity may not be permanent ; it may be that in 
the providence of the Lord there will be an era of good time for 
this country which will equally affect the Latter-day Saints and will 
enable them to get out of debt. So I want to urge my brethren and 
sisters to take the advice of the President seriously and make an effort 
to rid themselves of the bondage of debt. 

Some of my brethren and sisters say they are tied up so tight 
with debt that they do not know which way to turn. Well, there are 
only four ways to change that situation. The first is, to earn more. 



122 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Some of us can't do that. The second is, to spend less. Most of us 
don't like to do that. The third is, to dispose of our assets, and with 
our equity in our unencumbered assets pay our debts. But I want to 
give you a fourth method of paying your debts, and that is to pay 
your tithes and offerings in the season thereof. If we will tithe all that 
the Lord gives unto us. that belongs to us, and do it in the season 
thereof and at the time we receive it, the Lord has said that he will bless 
and prosper the land for our sakes. And there are hundreds of ways 
by which the Lord will bring about circumstances and conditions where 
our debts will be lighter and more easily paid, and funds come into our 
hands when we observe the law of tithing. 

Let me illustrate this by telling you an incident that occurred a 
few days ago. A certain well-known brother whose father has gone to 
rest — a great man in this Church, a man who has left a name and a 
fame that will never be forgotten — was on the non-tithepayers list. I 
spoke to him about the payment of his tithing. He said he could not 
possibly pay because he had promised to pay the bank where he was ow • 
ing a large amount, his full check for his pay for that month. I said, 
"You have no right to promise that to the bank which belongs to the 
Lord. There is where you make the mistake. You have taken 
the Lord's money and applied it for your own purposes and thus deprived 
yourself of a blessing." He replied: "What shall I do?" I said, 
"If it were my case, I would pay my tithing and trust to the Lord to find 
some way to help me out of my difficulties." He stood a little while, 
uncertain what to do. I went back to my desk. He came in and said : 
"I will do it," and he went to the proper department of the office, 
paid one-tenth of his check and stood outside on the front steps won- 
dering what to do. While standing there thinking oLsome kind of an 
excuse, a man came to him, who had owed him money for a number of 
years and said, "I have been looking for you for a day or two. Here is 
that $25 I owed you years ago." That was the exact amount of his 
tithing. 

Now I don't wish to leave an impression that the Lord will give 
to you or me just as much back as we pay him on tithing. Don't go 
away with that idea. But I do want to appeal to the Latter-day Saints 
to sit down with themselves and their conscience once a month, find out 
what the Lord has given to them, their interest, and tithe it first of all. 
Then the blessings of the Lord will surely be on the 90 per cent which he 
has given us to use according to our good judgment and discretion. 

If we will live the commandments of the Lord, we are entitled to his 
blessings and the promptings of his Spirit, which will bring gladness and 
happiness to our souls. 

A solo entitled, "The Lord has risen," was sun by Mrs. Mark 
Gardner. 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS

ELDER RULON S. WELLS 

(Of the First Council of Seventy) 

One week ago today Easter was being observed throughout all of 
the Christian countries in commemoration of the resurrection of the 
Lord Jesus Christ. I think, perhaps, this event could not be commemo- 
rated at a more appropriate time when all nature is bursting into a new- 
ness of life after the deadness of the cold winter months. But I think 
it would be better if the date were fixed definitely on some particular 
day, instead of being movable as now, ranging all the way from the 
22nd of March to some time in April. I like to think that Christ's 
resurrection really occurred on the 6th of April. I don't know whether 
such is the case or not. Christmas is another day that we are pleased 
to celebrate in commemoration of the birth of our Lord and Savior Jesus 
Christ. I do not think that there are any two events that have tran- 
spired in the history of this world that ought to be commemorated more 
than these particular two, and T like to think that both events occurred 
on the 6th day of April, the very day upon which the Church of Jesus 
Christ was organized, just ninety-three years ago. 

But, be that as it may, it doesn't make so much difference on what 
day we may choose to commemorate these important events that have 
taken place in the history of the world, in the coming of our Savior 
and in his glorious resurrection. But the all-important thing is this, 
that we do sense the importance of these events themselves, and that we 
have an abiding faith in their purport and believe with all our souls 
that Jesus Christ was born of the Virgin Mary, the Only Begotten of 
the Father in the flesh, and is therefore the Christ, the Son of the living 
God. It is also imoortant to believe that during his lifetime he promul- 
gated the plan of life and salvation, and taught the children of men 
as no one else has ever tought them the glorious principles of eternal 
life. It is also important that we should believe with all our souls that 
he gave his life as a ransom for the sins of the whole world, and that 
his precious blood was spilled as a means of saving mankind from the 
fall. It is also important that we shall believe with all our souls that 
on the third day he rose from the dead and overcame death and the 
grave, and became the first fruits of the resurrection. These are 
the important things: The observance of these two holy days in com- 
memorat'on of our Savior's marvelous birth of the Virgin Mary, and his 
miraculous resurrection from, the dead, is quite general throughout all 
Christian lands and amoncf the various so-called Christian churches. 
Ts it no f , therefore, most remarkable, indeed astonishing, that manv ad- 
herents of these churches, while ce'ebratina; the davs with great en- 
thusiasm, are losing the : r faith in the events themselves, even denying 
the immaculate conception, the divinity of Christ, and the reality of his 
glorious resurrection ; and that prominent ministers of these churches 
making such denials should be applauded and permitted to retain their 
pulpits. Surely the time has come, spoken of by Paul in his epistle to 



124 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Timothy, "when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their 
own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears," 
etc. 

What a wonderful thing is life! Things that live are very differ- 
ent from things that are dead, such as rocks, minerals, gold, silver, 
copper, etc. Things that live, "move and have a being," they take 
nourishment, they grow and they die. In these characteristics they dif- 
fer from things that have no life. Biologists in their endeavors to solve 
the problem of life have put forth many theories that have had a tend- 
ency to undermine the faith of some, while strengthening the faith of 
others, and while many interesting and valuable observations have been 
made relative to evolution, at the end of all their investigations they find 
themselves just as far as at the beginning from understanding the real 
problem of life itself ; and in their published works, it is usually ad- 
mited that "we do not know the origin of life." What is this thing that 
they call life? We see it manifest, the world is teeming with life. It is 
here upon the surface of the earth ; we find it in the air only for a 
few thousand feet up into it, and a few hundred feet down into the in- 
terior of the earth and out in the oceans, teeming with life, but beyond 
these limitations they know of no such thing as life. And this world 
upon which we live teeming thus with life, at one time we are told 
was a molten mass, that the heat was so intense that nothing could live 
on its surface or anywhere about it. All things were dead, could not live. 
The things that are dead differ from the things that live. Things that 
Jive have motion. It may only be a blade of grass moving its little 
roots down into the soil, or it may be a creeping insect, or the animal- 
culae that we cannot behold with the natural eye, or it may be in the 
beasts of the field, or it may be man, but life is everywhere aparem 
in the world. They can not account for it. It is preposterous to sup- 
pose that there is such a thing as spontaneous generation. 

Then, whence came life? The answer is in the Bible: "In the 
beginning God created the heavens and the earth," and all things that 
in them are. "The fool hath said in his heart, there is no God." I 
know, as I know that I live, that God lives and that he is my life, for in 
him I live and move and have my being, and without him I could not 
live, nor could anyone else live. He, then, is life. Does that correspond 
with the testimony of the Savior? You will remember when Lazarus 
died and Jesus heard of it, and came, Martha said to him: "Master, 
if you had been here he had not died," and the Savior said : "I am the 
resurrection and the life, and he that believeth on me; though he were 
dead, yet shall he live. Believeth thou this?" he said to Martha. "Yes, 
Lord, I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God." 
Do you believe that, Latter-day Saints? That is the faith that we should 
have. He, then, is the resurrection and the life. 

We live because of God, and without him there would be no life. 
Does that not also correspond with the revelation to the Prophet Joseph 
Smith? I quote from Doctrine & Covenants 88:15, 16, 17: "And the 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS 



125 



spirit and the body are the soul of man. And the resurrection from the 
dead is the redemption of the soul. And the redemption of the soul 
is through him who quickeneth all things." By whom then came 
this redemption ? Not by you or me ; oh, no, but through him who quick- 
eneth all things — who causes the grass to grow and everything to bloom, 
and all this teeming life to be and live. He is the author of life itself ; 
he is the resurrection and the life. Do you believe that? Latter-day 
Saints believe it. It is inscribed in their own hearts ; it is in the faith 
that we have received through the restoration of the gospel and the 
witness of the Spirit that we have received by the laying on of hands. 
Then let us live so that we may enjoy the sweet companionship of 
God's holy Spirit that bears witness to the truth of what I have said, 
and God help us to believe it with all our souls, and commemorate these 
holy days and seasons in the full faith that God lives and that he sent 
his Only Begotten Son, that whoseoever believeth in him should not 
perish, but obtain eternal life, which I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL 

(Of the First Council of Seventy) 

To begin with, if the brethren and .sisters desire me to run smoothly 
and make no breaks, it will be advisable to keep awake until I finish my 
speech, as it requires exceeding grgat faith to put into practice what 
you preach, and it calls for much faith to believe what you teach. For 
me to be my natural self is somewhat dangerous, and to be original 
would cause the very air to resound with criticism. I fully realize 
that brevity, and to the point, should be added to the virtues. Horace 
Greeley used to say that the way to write a good editorial was to write 
it to the best of your ability, then cut it in two in the middle and print 
the last half. I am going to follow this suggestion. 

Brevity, and to the point has been the instructions given by Presi- 
dent Grant. This counsel has been adhered to and is unusual and very 
gratifying. There have been many speakers and the Spirit of the Lord 
has been given to men who are not included among the general au- 
thorities of the Church, which is very encouraging to the people. I do 
not think as a people we have any special use for presidents of stakes, 
or bishops of wards, who are not directed by inspiration. Without 
the guidance of the Holy Spirit we cannot fill our appointments. 

I have been thinking of a subject for a considerable length of time, 
and I have the idea fixed and fastened in my mind. If we as Latter-day 
Saints will do our own thinking and search the revelations of the Lord, 
it will help us out of many of our difficulties. Therefore, I ask that 
you give careful consideration to some of the ideas I wish to convey. 
Elder B. H. Roberts has lately published a tract, for use in the Eastern 
States mission, entitled: The Lord Hath Spoken. The contents of this 
pamphlet is very interesting and instructive, as I have read it. 

Many testimonies have been given ddring the conference by the 



126 



GENERAL CONEERENCE 



brethren saying in no uncertain way, "We know that God lives." This to 
me is only the beginning of our recognition of the great loving Father 
for his children, "as no living soul can move, or wake, or open the eyes," 
that he does not see the self-expression of God's goodness and gracious- 
ness for his offspring. I have little hesitation in saying this is what 
parents should teach children before teaching them to pray and even 
children should grasp the idea "that God lives." 

They say that almost everybody has one big idea. It may come 
suddenly to your mind by inspiration, and the question arises : what 
do you do with it ? You put it in definite form and develop the gem of 
truth. To get a true conception of God is the biggest idea I have ever 
tried to comprehend. 

The second big idea is: "Have you found God? - ' 

St. Paul, when he spoke to the men of Athens, said that they might 
seek God, if perhaps they might grope and find him — yes, though he 
is not far from any one of us. We are the offspring of the living God, 
and as our heavenly Father is not far from any of us, he cannot be very 
far distant from me. 

Our pioneer fathers and mothers, as it was with the prophets 
of the Old and New Testament, had suffered disaster after disaster — ■ 
they knew — they had found God. They had tested the truth for them- 
selves. 

These leaders, seers, and teachers had no fear. In their anguish 
and tribulation they said: "Let it roll. The Lord will fight for you. 
Stand still and see what he wilLdo. His arm is not shortened, neither 
is his strength diminished. Trust in the Lord and be doing good, so 
shalt thou dwell in the land and verily thou shalt be fed. O, how great 
is the goodness which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee 
before the .sons of men. Be of good courage and he shall strengthen 
your heart, all ye that have hope in the Lord." 

What is in the future? How far can we see ahead of us? Some 
of us cannot see the length of our noses, but the prophets have warned 
us of the danger that menaces us. We must be prepared and get our 
feet planted upon the ground, because we don't know, I don't know, what 
test is ahead of us. The gospel of Jesus Christ has had to be preached 
with tears and beseechings, sufferings, adversity and persecution from 
one generation to another. No generation accepted it because their 
belief in material power was so dense that they lost faith in the spiritual. 
We have to talk of the temporal. Temporal things have to be attended 
to, or we all would starve to death, but we must not place the temporal 
before the spiritual, for if we do, you can look out for disaster and 
trouble. No man can save the nation, or a people when they get the 
temporal first and forget the spiritual. I went on a mission for two 
years, and I came home and I loved everybody, but I hadn't been home 
long before I partook of the environment. No thinking man or wom- 
an can be free from deep forebodings, however optimistic we try to 
keep ourselves, with this crisis in world history. Fear has crept 



ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL 



127 



into the hearts of men. You talk to them, and see for yourselves. 1 
think many of the Latter-day Saints are greatly frightened. You don't 
know what is going to happen. Time must be close at hand when we 
shall need a living testimony and knowledge for ourselves that God 
lives and that Jesus Christ is the Savior of the world. Have we found 
God? Have we found him strong enough, so that we are stripped to 
the skin? — then we cry out: "I will rejoice in God. I will joy in 
the God of my salvation." Elias Kimball and I worked for the Lord, 
and we gave the very best effort we had while in the Southern states 
and when we came back we went over the hill to the poorhouse. We 
hadn't a penny left, but we loved God. We had found him., and I still 
rejoice in God. 

I am going to read you something that was said three years after 
I was born. That is a very long time ago. It seems to me like a hun- 
dred years. A prophet of God said it, and it is coming true every day, 
but it has taken a long time to fulfil the prophecy. In the year 1856— 
Heber C. Kimball said : "We think we are secure here in the chambers 
of the everlasting hills, but I say to you, the time is coming when we 
will be mixed up in these now peaceful valleys to that extent that it will 
be difficult to tell the face of a Saint from the face of an enemy of the 
people of God." Can't you see its fulfilment? You cannot tell a 
"Mormon" from a Gentile unless you know them. I have stood on a 
corner of Main street to prove the fulfilment of this statement, and I 
have taken out my watch for one hour, and I am a pretty well informed 
man as to faces. I have lived here all my life. 1 am pretty well known 
among the people. I only saw a very few that were "Mormons," and 
I wasn't right sure of them. "Then, brethren, when that time comes, 
look out for the great sieve, for there will be a great sifting time and 
many will fall, for I say unto you there is coming a test, a test, a test, 
and who will be able to stand?" That was just what our father kept 
saying. Father came up to the house, and he said in the presence of my 
mother, who lived there : "O" the test, the test, the test, who will 
be able to stand?" My mother replied: "Brother Heber, what i.s the 
test?" "I don't know, but only those who know that Jesus is the Christ 
can stand." 

Brethren and sisters, I am about to conclude: If you will think 
about what I have said don't get fearful — be like those old prophets. 
This is God's work; God is at the helm. He will take care of us no 
matter what our troubles are. We will never be shaken, if we know 
that Jesus is the Christ. It is a wonderful thing to know. I know there 
is something that prophesies to my soul that this is true because I have 
a light, if you can only get it lighted. A manifestation of the Spirit of 
God is given to every man and woman and child and I know that there 
is something that prophesies to my soul that this is true because I have 
tested it. I have not finished my work yet. I think I look as if I had 
had some experience. I haven't got much knowledge, but T have enough, 
all I need to know is that this is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 



128 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



day Saints, and I am able to demonstrate that I know that God lives. 
I hope the Lord will be kind to me and not leave me to forsake him. 
I don't think he will, unless I do wrong, but no one knows how safe 
he is. My father said that his election had been made sure, and just 
before his death an angel appeared to him and told Heber C. 
Kimball, "Your work is finished." His work was completed, his election 
was made sure. We don't hear much about that now-a-days. 

I pray in your behalf that you will not allow yourselves to be 
shaken, but if you desire to have faith in God and in this Church you 
have got to work, and you have got to make sacrifice, and the time will 
come, just as sure as you live and breathe and have a being, when you 
will not only say that you are willing to place all upon the altar, but you 
will do it. I am ready now. I haven't got very much, but everything 
goes. I will stake my all. 

The Lord bless you. Amen. 

The names of the General Authorities of the Church were presented 
for acceptance by Elder Seymour B. Young as presented in the Taber- 
nacle meeting and by unanimous vote sustained. 

ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 

(Of the First Council of Seventy) 

I think, my brethren and sisters, that the one great duty confronting 
us today is to teach the gospel in our homes, to our children. While 
we have our many teachers in the various auxiliary organizations of the 
Church, yet the greatest teacher a child can have are the parents. If 
you will turn to the sixth chapter of Deuteronomy, you will find words 
of wisdom, and the admonition of the Prophet Moses to teach your 
children the laws of God: 

"Now these are the commandments, the statutes, and the judgments, 
which the Lord your God commanded to teach you, that ye might do them 
in the land whither ye go to possess it: 

"That thou mightest fear the Lord thy God, to keep all his statutes and his 
commandments, which I command thee, thou, and thy son, and thy son's 
son, all the days of thy life ; and that thy days may be prolonged. 

"Here therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be well with 
thee, and that ye may increase mightily, as the Lord God of tny tathers hath 
promised thee, in the land that floweth with milk and honey. 

"Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord: 

"And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with 
all thy soul, and with all thy might. 

"And these w,ords, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine 
heart: 

"And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk 
of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the 
way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. 

"And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be 
as frontlets between thine eyes.

"And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house, and on thy 
gates. 

"And it shall be, when the Lord thy God shall have brought thee unto the 
,land which he sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, 
to give thee great and goodly cities, which thou buildedst not, 

"And houses full of all go,od things, which thou filledst not, and wells 
digged, which thou diggedst not, vineyards and olive trees, which thou 
plantedst not; when thou shalt have eaten and be full; 

"Then beware lest thou forget the Lord which brought thee forth out 
of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage. 

"Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God, and serve him, ana snalt swear by 
his name. 

"Ye shall not go after other gods, of. the gods of the people which are 
round about you." 

Among the ancient Jews, the parents began to teach their children 
Bible verses as soon as the children could understand. One of the first 
things that Jesus learned in the little home at Nazareth was the first 
verse of the Shema, the national confession of faith : "Hear, O Israel, 
Jehovah is our God, Jehovah alone." Other verses from the law and 
the prophets would be learned one by one. 

During the French revolution while the Reign of Terror in Paris 
was striking fear and hate into the hearts of every citizen, the French 
Assembly, by vote, discarded the Christian religion, and set up "The God 
of Reason." Then terror did reign. People lost all reason; the higher 
standards of morality were forgotten; sin reigned supreme. For- 
tunately for France, Napoleon Bonaparte restored the Christian religion 
by edict. But, alas, from that day to this, "the God of Reason" has pre- 
vailed too much over the living God of Love, the Father of us all. In 
our homes, we can have the Spirit of God only as w^ think of Jesus 
Christ and live as he has asked us to live. It is man's soul that Christ 
is looking for; and the great thing that Christ did first was to find his 
own soul. Out of the carpenter's shop at Nazareth came a personality 
infinitely greater than any made by myth or legend, and one destined to 
reveal to the human race the real beauties of life, the Fatherhood of 
God, and the brotherhood of man. In our homes Jesus Christ should 
be our ideal, and you know that he waged war against vulgarism and 
the materialistic manner of living. Christ swept false systems away, 
and gave us a mortality based on the principle that his God and our 
God lives. His morality was sympathy, and he had no regard whatever 
for the dry, lifeless systems of his day. 

The song of Isaiah rings true today : "He is despised and rejected 
of men, a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief ; and we hid as it 
were our faces from him." 

We parents must teach Christ more and more to our children, and 
like the Jews of old, hang upon the entrance of our homes and write 
it in our hearts : "Hear, O Israel, Jehovah is our God, Jehovah alone." 
Long before the Jewish child could read, he was attracted by members 
of the family pausing before the doorway touching reverently the 
Mezuzah, a small, shining cylinder of wood or metal, kissing the hand 

5

that touched it, and then passing on. Later on, he learned that the 
Mezuzah was placed upon the doorway obedient to the divine command: 
"Thou shalt write them (the laws) upon the doorsteps of thy house 
and upon thy gates." Within the cylinder were the words of the Lord 
as given to Moses: "Jehovah is our God, Jehovah alone." Can we 
parents not become more and more the teachers of our children ? With 
God's blessing I hope we may. Amen. 

ELDER CHARLES H. HART 

(Of the First Council of Seventy) 

I think I may voice the appreciation of this entire audience to the 
Jordan choir for the sweet music they have rendered to us this after- 
noon. There is an expression of ancient times that when other heav- 
enly muses were called away from earth that music, a 'divine hand- 
maiden, remained behind, self-exiled, for man's sake. 

I have only recently found my text for remarks for the few min- 
utes that are allotted to me. They are to be found in the fifteenth chap- 
ter of Matthew. The Lord, our Redeemer, is rebuking the scribes and 
Pharisees, and he is teaching the doctrine that "not that which goeth into 
the mouth defileth the man; but that which cometh out of the 
mouth, this defileth a man." You will remember that the Pharisees 
complained of these men of God for not washing their hands, and it 
brought forth the rebuke from the Master that they were hypocrites, 
that they drew near him with their mouths and with the lips gave hon- 
or, but their hearts were far from him. He reminded them that they 
were violating the commandments of the Lord in not honoring father 
and mother, that they would withhold their substance by the use of the 
word "corban," it is a gift, and therefore did not honor nor sustain 
father and mother. Then he went on to say, when his disciples told 
him that the Pharisees were offended at what he said : "Every plant, 
which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up." We have 
heard at this conference of some of these plants which our heavenly 
Father has not planted and which must be rooted up — those mentioned 
by President Ivins this morning in that learned address given by him. 
He enumerated some of the evils of the past, the result of civil plants 
being planted on ecclesiastical soil, and ecclesiastical plants on civil 
soil. The Junkerism of Potsdam, and the Kaiserism of Germany were 
plants that the heavenly Father did not plant, and therefore they had 
(to be rooted up at the cost of so many billions of treasure and mil- 
lions of lives. And so here are other plants in our own nation and 
in other countries of the world that are not plants that the heavenly 
Father has planted, and they must be rooted up. 

In connection with the words of the Savior that that which cometh 
out of the mouth defileth a man, on the very day that this conference 
assembled, on the 6th of April, a press dispatch gave an account of 



ELDER CHARLES H.HART 



131 



testimony in court of an officer of Los Angeles, a former I. W. W., 
who swore that it was the doctrine of the I. W. W.'s that the church 
was the greatest curse of the world, that there was no God, no heaven 
and no hell. He said other things that defiled him, as a witness, by 
merely recounting the beliefs and utterances of the members of his 
former order. It defiled the* press to even repeat the sworn testimony 
of this officer. It would be desecration and blasphemy on my part even 
to repeat the things which that witness and the press published in 
reference to our Redeemer and Savior. 

Time would not permit this afternoon to enumerate the many 
things which you know are plants which our heavenly Father has not 
planted and which must be rooted up. On the other hand we may 
think of the many plants which he has planted, — the glorious princi- 
ples recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants and in the Book of Mor- 
mon, and brought forth in connection with the restoration of the gos- 
pel,- — all plants which our heavenly Father has planted and which need 
not be rooted up, — indeed, can not be. 

I heard praise today of our missioniary system; — praise for the ac- 
complishments of our boys in the field. This is a true field of edu- 
cation. This missionary system is a plant which our heavenly Father 
has planted, and therefore, if the missionaries do their part, the re- 
sults are wonderful. We almost need to be introduced to our boys as 
they come home, they have developed so rapidly. It was my joy yes- 
terday to go into the afternoon meeting with my son whom I had not 
seen for two and a half years, serving in the mission field, as your 
boys and your girls serve. Those of you who have had similar expe- 
riences understand the joy of a father and mother who have these ex- 
periences. 

Speaking of this system of education, in this age, when all things 
are being tested anew, I am reminded of the fact that William George 
Jordan, the author of Great Truths, a book with which many of you 
are familiar, a book given away by the hundreds, if not by the thou- 
sands, by the president of our Church, — Mr. Jordaivis framing an in- 
dictment just now against the educational system of our country. The 
articles are being published in The Forum, under the head of, "What 
Is the Matter with Education?" Two articles have been published in 
the March and April numbers and two more are promised. Already 
a very broad indictment against our present system of education has 
been formulated. It is yet too early for one to pass judgment upon 
the merits of this controversy, which will probably be participated in 
by some of the seven hundred thousand teachers in the United States, 
the best of whom may answer the various counts in indictment. It 
is too early, with only a half of hi.s indictment penned, to undertake 
to speak of the merits, just as one would not wisely venture to name 
his son after a living statesman, but would wait until his life's work 
is finished. However, I venture there will be some counts in this 
broad indictment, — an indictment that is altogether too sweeping — in 



. V 

132 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

which merit will be found. There will be time enough when the in- 
dictment is fully returned, and has been answered by the educators, 
for the American people to reach a verdict on the controversy; but 1 
think the underlying secret of effective education, will be found to be 
the wise commingling of theory and practice such as obtains in our 
missionary system. The young missionary is applying in his life and 
in his teachings the principles of truth as he learns them. I am not 
making a plea for less preparation at home, but am trying to show 
the advantage of learning and having the practice at the same time. 
Time will not permit to develop even the theory of this great essay- 
ist, but in brief he says that man has seven lives — not in the same 
sense that a cat has been said to have nine lives, but he divides up 
the phases of life into physical, mental, moral or ethical, aesthetic or 
emotional, the civic life, the social life, and the religious life. He 
makes an appeal for the training and development of the senses which 
will enable one to properly respond in this life to these seven phases 
of life. 

Recently we have had throughout the Church instruction in the 
restoration of the Priesthood, a system which the Lord has devised, — 
the Aaronic Priesthood, which he planted when John, the son of 
Zacharias, laid his hands upon the head of Joseph and Oliver and ut- 
tered those beautiful words recorded in the 13th Section of the Doc- 
trine and Covenants. And the Melchizedek Priesthood was re-planted 
when Peter, James and John laid their hands upon Joseph and Oliver 
and restored a Priesthood named after Melchizedek, the great high 
priest, so-called to avoid the too frequent repetition of the precious 
and sacred name of Deity, — to be held sacred from too frequent rep- 
itition in the pulpit as well as elsewhere ; the Priesthood after the 
order of -Enoch, which was after the order of the Only Begotten Son 
in the flesh, of the Father. We have learned of some of the sublime 
truths pertaining to these branches of the Priesthood. One of the 
sublime revelations on Priesthood closes with these words: "Where- 
fore, now, let every man learn his duty to act in the office in which 
he is appointed in all diligence. He that is slothful shall not be 
counted worthy to stand, and he that learns not his duty and shows 
himself not approved shall not be counted worthy to stand." 

There is a very significant passage or verse, the 19th of the 136th 
section of the Doctrine and Covenants, which I should like to read : 
"Zion shall be redeemed in mine own due time, and if any man shall 
seek to build up himself, and seeketh not my counsel, he shall have no 
power, and his folly shall be made manifest." This is from a revela- 
tion to the Prophet Brigham Young. There are other verses here of 
a practical nature. We might read with profit the remainder of that 
section in reference to care in borrowing and returning, in delivering 
to our neighbor lost goods, and a number of very practical things incul- 
cating the principles of honesty and integrity, principles to be culti- 
vated particularly among our boys and girls. 



ELDER CHARLES H. HART 



133 



May the Lord bless us and help us to serve him, help us to estab- 
lish all the plants which our heavenly Father has planted, and assist 
us in uprooting other plants which he has not planted, is my prayer 
and I ask it in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER SEYMOUR B. YOUNG 

(President of the First Council of Seventy) 

My brethren and sisters : We have had a variety of .speaking and 
speakers this afternoon, to whom vou have listened, I have no doubt, 
with great pleasure, as I have. 

On Friday morning President Heber J. Grant made some remark; 
about the dedication of the Salt Lake temple, and referred to some 
persons who are still living that were among the general authorities of 
the Church at the time of the dedication Services. 

I heard President Wilford Woodruff tell of this incident connected 
with his ministry. He said that several years before the temple 
was completed, he was sitting on the east steps of the temple entrance 
and President Brigham Young came to him and said : "Brother Wood- 
ruff, take the keys and unlock the doors of the temple and let the 
people in." When President Woodruff awoke on the following morn- 
ing, he wondered why he was commissioned to let the people into the 
temple, realizing that President John Taylor was at that time president 
of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, But time passed along 
swiftly as usual. President Taylor passed away on July 25, 1887, to his 
eternal great reward, and about two or three years after his demise, Pres- 
ident Woodruff, being President of the Twelve and consequently the 
presiding officer of the Church was sustained and set apart as President 
of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. This occurred 
April 7, 1889. Four years thereafter, the temple was completed, 
April 6, 1893. President Woodruff then said :"I realize now that 
my appointment was proper, I have taken the keys, and I have unlocked 
the doors of the temple, and I have bidden the people to enter to our 
dedicatorial services." 

I am pleased to see that the Latter-day Saints are advancing 
along the lines of higher education. I observe during this conference 
the system of wireless telegraphy, or wave motions of sound that 
are spoken into a receiver or transmitter and carried to every 
part of the house. In speaking of this matter, a lady addressed me 
at noon time today, one of my acquaintances, and said: "Brother 
Young, I heard the speakers tolerably well inside the house — I was 
at the extreme end of the building— -but when I stepped out through 
the open door I could hear with much greater distinctness than I 
could on, the inside," and she thought the sound waves advanced 
irregularly, and it reminded me of our recent storms that we have 
had. The storms sometimes have a center of fierceness. In Salt Lake 



134 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



City the storm rages; out at Cottonwood, seven or eight or ten miles 
away, they scarcely know about having any storm at the same time, 
so that the storm waves gather and spread in cycles in different parts 
of the country. So it is with our sound waves that come through the 
transmitter into the great tabernacle during this conference, and by 
and by they will arrive at a greater perfection in transmitting sound 
this way to different parts of our great buildings, and the perfection 
will come with the experience that we shall gain. 

My brethren and sisters, I rejoice in our organizations. Doctor 
Winship, when he was here, speaking hefore the school boards of the 
state, made this remark: "The system of teaching the young people 
of the Latter-day Saints from the age of twelve years to the age of 
eighteen, is superior to that of any other community with whom I have 
been acquainted." That, now, is a very welcome compliment paid to the 
Latter-day Saints by a man who knew whereof he spoke. 

Recently I have observed that the physicians have again decided 
after thorough investigation of the power or principles or stimulating 
effects of alcohol — that alcohol is not a stimulant — you know we are 
trying to observe absolutely the system that will do away entirely 
with the use of stimulants from the alcoholic process. Now, they 
registered one hundred patients of typhoid fever. Fifty of them were 
given stimulants in the way of alcohol, because certain physicians rec- 
ommended that it be given as a stimulant to aid them in their re- 
covery. Thirty-five per cent of that fifty died under the stimulat- 
ing process. Out of the other fifty who had no alcohol, thirty-five 
of them recovered. It has been proved that the Latter-day Saints, 
when they took the stand for absolute prohibition, and as they are teach- 
ing it today, went on the side of the right, they had the right view 
of the matter, and by this means they are safe-guarchng the rising 
and growing generations of our children. I am glad to be a Latter- 
day Saint. I rejoice that I have fellowship among my brethren and 
sisters. 

I want to say this for the information of some who are here and 
maybe don't know that the recent amendment of Senator Reed 
Smoot has brought into the circle of pension receivers about two or 
three hundred more. There are certain rules yet that we cannot 
quite reach with all of the legislation that has been enacted in favor 
of the pensioners of the Indian, -vars of Utah, but Senator Smoot 
has again introduced another bill of protest which is more sweeping 
in its character, and those who are deserving of pensions and who 
will be left out at the present time will only have to wait a little 
longer. When his new bill becomes a law I think it will take in all 
that are worthy of the pension claim. 

My brethren and sisters, I pray the Lord to bltss you. I feel 
in my heart glad to be with you today, and I pray that the spirit 
of your mision, fathers and mothers, may rest upon you constantly, 
that you may be indeed not only parents to your children, but friends 



ELDER SEYMOUR B. YOUNG 



135 



to them, and actual associates with them and get into the deeper recesses 
of their hearts by your kindness and your solicitation for their wel- 
fare, and let them feel that you love them, that you love them dearly, 
and that you have their interest at heart all the day long, and thus 
you will easily bring your children into lines of greater perfection 
as they advance in life, preparing them for the great events that are 
to transpire in the future, and fitting them to take the places of their 
parents in the leadership and membership of the great societies of the 
Church, and thus making good your parentage in the rearing of 
your children in the fear of the Lord. God bless you, my brethren 
and sisters, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 

I have had a great many reflections ; many thoughts have come 
into my mind during this conference. I realize that I can only men- 
tion one or two this afternoon. 

THE WORLDS ARE A MEANS TO AN END, NOT THE END ITSELF. 

There comes to my mind an expression in the Pearl of Great 
Price, in the vision of Moses, which was given at a time when Moses 
was caught up into an exceeding high mountain and saw God face 
to face and talked with him., The Lord showed to Moses the "work- 
manship of his hands," and Moses beheld the world, and all the chil- 
dren of men to the latest generations. 

And the Lord said to Moses : 

"For behold there are many worlds that have passed away by the 
word of my power. And there are many that now stand, and innumerable 
are they unto man, but all things are numbered unto me, tor they are mine 
and I know them.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



And it came to pass that Moses spake unto the Lord, saying: Be mer- 
ciful unto thy servant, O God, and tell me concerning this earth and the 
inhabitants thereof, and also the heavens, and then thy servant will be con- 
tent. 

And the Lord God spake unto Moses, saying: The heavens, they are 
many, and they cannot be numbered unto man ; but they are numbered unto 
me, for they are mine." 

We are informed by astronomers that some of these worlds are 
so large that they would fill the space occupied by our sun, and ex- 
tending out to the orbit of Mars, far beyond the orbit of the earth on 
which we dwell. Such, they say, is the case in regard to the great 
star in the constellation of Orion. While reflecting on this matter the 
thought comes to mind that notwithstanding the countless number of 
worlds and the great magnitude of many of them, they are a means 
to an end, and not the end itself. The Father is creating worlds for 
the purpose of peopling them — placing upon them his sons and his 
daughters. We are informed in section 76 of the Doctrine and Cove- 
nants, that by and through the Son of God, the "worlds are and were 
created, and the inhabitants thereof are begotten sons and daughters 
unto God." 

MAN THE MOST IMPORTANT OF GOD'S CREATIONS 

We learn from these scriptures from which I have read and from 
other revelations from the Lord, that man is the most important of all 
our Father's creations. In the same vision given to Moses, the Father 
said : "And as one earth shall pass away, and the heavens 
thereof, even so shall another come ; and there is no end to my works, 
neither to my words. For behold, this is my work and my glory — to 
bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man." 

god's love for mankind. 

From this, and other scripture, I say, we learn that the great 
work of the Father is to bring to pass the salvation of his children 
giving unto each that reward which each merits according to his 
works. I feel most assuredly that our Father in heaven is far more 
interested in a soul — one of his children — than it is possible for an 
earthly father to be m one of his children. His love for us is greater 
than can be the love of an earthly parent for his offspring. In an- 
other part of this record we are informed that when the Lord spoke 
to Enoch and showed to him, the nations of the earth and explained 
to him the nature of the punishment that should befall them for 
their transgressions of his commandments, that the Lord wept and 
showed his sorrow in tears for their disobedience. Because of this, 
Enoch marvelled and thought it strange that the Lord could weep. 

Here is the passage: 

"And it came to pass that the God of heaven looked upon the residue 
of the people, and he wept; and Enoch bore record of it, saying: How is 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 137 



it that the heavens weep, and shed forth their tears as tne rain upon the 
mountains? 

"And Enoch said unto the Lord: How is it that thou c^nst weep, seeing 
thou art holy and from all eternity to all eternity? 

"And were it possible that man could number the particles of the earth, 
yea millions of earths like this, it would not be a beginning to the number 
of thy creations; and thy curtains are stretched out still; and yet thou art 
there, and thy bosom is there and also thou art merciful and kind forever.' 

And the Lord answered: "* * * Behold these thy brethren; they 
are the workmanship of mine own hands, and I gave unto them their 
knowledge, in the day I created them; and in the Garden of Eden, gave I 
unto man his agency; 

"And unto thy brethren have I said, and also given commandment, that 
thev should choose me, their Father; but behold they are without affection, 
and they hate their own blood." 

MAN MUST BE REDEEMED ACCORDING TO LAW 

These are reasons why the Lord wept and why the heavens wept. 

I was asked by a brother one time if a man could be perfectly 
happy in the celestial kingdom if one of his children was not permit- 
ted to enter there. I told him that I supposed that any man who was 
so unfortunate as to have one of his children barred from the celes- 
tial kingdom would, of course, have feelings of sorrow because of that 
condition; and that is just the position our Father in heaven is in.. 
(Not all of his children are worthy of celestial glory, and many are 
forced to suffer his wrath because of their transgressions, and this 
causes the Father and the whole heavens to have sorrow and to weep. 
The Lord works in accordance with natural law. Man must be re- 
deemed according to law and his reward must be based on the law of 
justice. Because of this the Lord will not give unto men that which 
they do not merit, but shall reward all men according to their works. 

THE WORTH OF SOULS GREAT IN THE SIGHT OF GOD. 

In my preaching I have always tried to be consistent and to be 
careful, keeping in mind the things that I have said here this after- 
noon, knowing the worth of souls. The Lord made the statement, 
in one of the revelations given shortly before the organization of the 
Church, that the worth of souls is great : 

"Remember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God : 

"For behold, the Lord your Redeemer suffered death in the flesh: 

wherefore he suffered the pain of all men that all men might repent and 

come unto him." 

Knowing this, and realizing as I think I do the fact that the hu- 
man soul, — and by that I mean the spirit and body combined — is 
the most important of all the works of God, I have tried to be care- 
full in my teachings only to express those things which are true and 
which can be proved by the revelations of the Lord, fearing lest I 
should teach something that was not true and which might affect my 



138 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



brother and my sister and cause that they might depart from the path 
of truth and righteousness. 

THE GOSPEL PLAN NOT EASY FOR THE WAYWARD. 

I have never been able in my teachings to make the gospel plan 
appear easy; that is, to hold out hopes to those who are indifferent, to 
those who are wayward, to those who wilfully break the command- 
ments of the Lord and will not hearken unto these truths when every 
opportunity is given them to obey the truth. I have always tried to im- 
press upon the people the fact that the gate is strait and the way is 
narrow which leadelh unto life and few there be that find it, — in ref- 
erence to the celestial kingdom of God. I know that the Father will 
save all the workmanship of his hands in the three great kingdoms, 
the Celestial, the Terrestrial or the Telestial, except Sons of Perdition. 
But only the righteous, those who are just and true, .shall enter the 
Celestial Kingdom. 

OUR DUTY TO LABOR FOR THE SALVATION OF MAN 

Now, if the worth of souls is great, then we ought to be engaged 
in the saving of souls ; and I feel that it is the duty of every man hold- 
ing the Priesthood not only to strive to save himself and his immediate 
family, but it is his duty to labor in that Priesthood for the salvation 
of all men ; and this responsibility rests not merely upon those who hold 
the Priesthood, but upon all the members of the Church who know the 
truth. 

For a moment or two, however, I desire to reverse this picture; 
and the reason that I do is because of the remarks that have been 
made here concerning the doctrines of false teachers in the world — 
men who stand up before the congregations of the people, telling them 
not to believe in Christ, that he is not the Son of God, that he did not 
rise from the dead, that he did not atone for the sins of the world. 

DENYING CHRIST A FEARFUL RESPONSIBILITY. 

Now, brethren and sisters, let me, if I can, impress upon you this 
thought: If the worth of souls is great as I have shown, and our joy 
shall be great in heaven with those we may be able to bring unto the 
strait and narrow way, what will be our feelings if, through any 
teachings of ours, one soul is barred from the Celestial Kingdom? If 
that which we have taught and practiced shall destroy the faith of one 
individual so that he does not accept the truth and that fact is made 
known unto us when we stand before the judgment seat; — then, let me 
ask, how great will be our sorrow, how great will be the condemna- 
tion which we will merit in that we have barred, through our influence 
and through our teachings, one of the children of our Father from en- 
tering into eternal exaltation? I tell you that these men who stand up 
and say that Jesus is not the Christ, that he was a great teacher, but 
not the Son of God, the Only Begotten of the Father, and thus lead 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 



139 



many to deny the power of the resurrection and the divinity of Christ, 
are taking upon themselves a most terrible responsibility that should cause 
them to fear and tremble. I could not stand it to know that I had 
taught an untruth that would lead people to destruction. And when 
these men realize what they have clone and that, not only their own 
souls have not been saved, but they have been the means of destroy- 
ing the souls of other men, leading them away from truth and right- 
eousness, I tell you that it shall be hard with them, and their pun- 
ishment shall be most severe in eternity. 

MEN SHOULD TEACH WHAT THEY UNDERSTAND. 

I mention these matters that our attention may be called to that 
which is our duty ; and that a man should not teach that which he 
does not know to be the truth. The revelations of the Lord have been 
given unto us for our salvation that we may understand and walk in 
the light, that we may teach others and impart unto them the same 
instructions that we receive, that they, likewise, may receive salvation ; 
for I am satisfied that our Father in heaven would, if it were possi- 
ble, save all men and give unto them celestial glory, even the fulness 
of exaltation. But, he has given unto man his agency and man is 
under the necessity of obeying the truth according to that which is re- 
vealed in order to obtain the exaltation of the righteous. We are not 
walking now by sight, as we did before we came into this world, but 
the Lord expects that we shall walk by faith ; and walking by faith we 
shall receive the reward of the righteous, if we adhere unto those com- 
mandments which are given for our salvation and that men may again 
come back, through the resurrection from the ri^rt into +t>e presence 
of the Father and the Son. 

THE BEST IS THE FULNESS OF THE FATHER'S KINGDOM. 

I know that Jesus Christ is the Redeemer of the world, that he 
came into the world to take upon him the transgression of every soul 
who would repent ; and that we, through our repentance and our faith 
and our acceptance of the principles of the gospel, shall receive full 
salvation through the shedding of his blood and through the atonement 
which he brought to pass that we might receive these blessings. More- 
over, I know that all men shall be redeemed from death, because men 
are not responsible for death, therefore Jesus Christ has redeemed 
them from death through the shedding of his blood. They shall rise in 
the resurrection, every man to receive his reward according to his 
works. We who have received the truth of the everlasting gospel 
ought not to be satisfied with anything short of the best, and the best 
is the fulness of the Father's kingdom; and for that I hope and pray 
we shall live and set examples in righteousness to all men that none 
may stumble, that none may falter, that none may turn from the path 
of righteousness, due to anything that we may do or say, and I ask it 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE 

A CONDITION OF THE COVENANT TO ABRAHAM 

On each day of this great conference, and I believe at every 
session, the name of the great patriarch Abraham has been mentioned, 
and whenever I have heard it I have thought in part of that for 
which his name stands — Abraham, the man unto whom the Lord spake 
when again the world had gone to apostasy, the man with whom he 
made covenant and established the gospel. There had been apostasies 
before and a great apostasy was then in progress, when the Lord 
spake unto him. making covenant with him, definite, sure and blessed ; 
among other things telling him that through him and his posterity all 
nations of the earth should be blessed. This was one of the condi- 
tions of the covenant, that he and his posterity should serve the true 
and the living God, the God who spoke unto him, Jehovah. 

THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, WORSHIPERS OF JEHOVAH 

The world was pagan, heathen and idolatrous, and the Lord 
would have some few at least whom he could call his own. There- 
fore did he establish his covenant with Abraham, and later he affirm- 
ed it with Isaac and again with Jacob whose children are known by the 
honored title "the children of Israel." One of the characteristics of 
that chosen people — for chosen they were and are — was and is that 
they be worshipers of the living God, not the gods of men, not the 
idols that men may fashion with their hands, nor the fantastic deities 
that men may hatch out in their minds as vague conceptions without 
bodies or parts, without place — but *he God of love and the God of 
fear, the God than whom there is none other in the proper sense and 
usage of the term. 

Consider the situation. All the rest of the world, I repeat, had 
gone after idols, and Abraham and his posterity came to be dis- 
tinguished amongst the nations of "Jehovah worshipers." That was 
one of the characteristics by which the children of Israel were known, 
even during their Egyptian bondage, though they themselves sometimes 
forgot it in part, by which they were known throughout the scenes 
of the exodus, by which they were known after their etsablishment 
in the Promised Land, by which they were known even during the 
time of their great transgressions, for even when the people as a 
nation had become recreant there were amongst them many who 
had not forgotten the God of their fathers, and who did not turn 
aside after Baal or Ashtoreth, nor after the Egyptian Apis, or any of 
the rest of the mythological deities. 

THE IDOLS THAT MEN WORSHIP 

The idols that man makes and which he sets up and worships 
are the workmanship of his hands or mind. The God of our spirits, 
verily the Father of our spirits, is no God of man's creation. He creat- 



ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE 



141 



ed us, and calls upon us to worship him and to obey his command- 
ments. Israel was a peculiar people of old, and has remained a 
peculiar people both in the gathered and in the scattered condition, 
and that was one of the signs by which they were distinguished from 
their heathen, pagan, idolatrous contemporaries, and by which they are 
distinguished from their heathen, pagan, idolatrous contemporaries today. 
For, mark you , idolatry never was more rife, and paganism was never 
more widespread than in this very year of our Lord, 1923. Men may not 
now put their golden idols or their images of silver, or brass, or iron, 
or wood, or stone, always up upon pedestals, and physically kneel down 
before them and worship them. Gold need not always be cast in the 
form of a calf after the pattern of Apis to be verily the god of man. 

ISRAEL A SABBATH-OBSERVING PEOPLE 

There were other signs by which these people, who were called 
after the name of that living God, were distinguished. One of them 
was that they observed every seventh day as the Sabbath of the Lord. 
Even the heathen nations had their fast days, but such were instituted 
by men for the purpose of gratifying the Inst of men, and the con- 
ceptions of men as to ceremonial and show. The Sabbath of the 
Lord our God is not a creation of men. Jesus the Christ is Lord of 
the Sabbath, and Israel amongst the pagan world was characterized 
as a Sabbath-observing people. Did not the Lord say through Moses, 
again through Nehemiah, and again through Ezekel and through oth- 
ers of the prophets — This is a sign 'between the children of Israel and 
me ? It shall be a sign between me and my children through all gener- 
ations forever, that they shall observe my Sabbaths. 

Pagan sabbaths were holidays, not holy clays. Though the two 
terms come from the same root, there is a vital distinction between 
them at the present time. The Lord chided the people of old because 
they had polluted his Sabbaths, and how had they polluted them? Not 
always by continuing their worldly work, not always because they did 
not cease their toil, but because they made the Sabbath a day of 
pleasure and of license and of indulgence that was evil, and forgot to 
worship the Lord their God specifically on that day of rest. We are 
not required, nor are we permitted^, if we obey the law of God, to be 
idle. We should be active and in service, but Sabbath-day work should 
be directly the service of God and not the secular and wage-earning 
service of man. 

TITHE-PAYING ANOTHER CHARACTERISTIC OF ISRAEL 

There was another prominent distinction, in that those ancient 
Israelites, even before they came to be a nation, and later as a na- 
tion, were peculiar amongst the peoples of the earth by being tithepayers. 
They were a tithed people. Perhaps some scholars may say that even 
the Egyptians practiced the law of tithing. Yes, in a certain way 



142 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



they did, and other pagan nations have done the same, but to all such 
tithe paying was a law that they had established amongst themselves, 
and that they put into operation through compulsion. They did not 
practice the law of tithing because it was required of them by the 
Lord, but they themselves evolved the idea. They found it a conven- 
ient method of taxation. It was not holy, it was not sacred unto them, 
but in early days the Lord made it plain that His people, to be accept- 
able unto Him, must be tithed, and everything they had was to be 
tithed. 

THE LAW OF SACRIFICE CONTRASTED 

Now, the law, very often called the Mosaic law, was in course 
of time superseded by the gospel, the gospel restored through the 
ministry of Christ — it had been upon the earth before. The gospel 
had been given to Adam with the ordinances essential to salvation. 
It had been given to Noah, it had been given to Abraham, but it 
was brought again by the Christ after a long period of partial apostasy, 
during which period the chosen people were living under the lesser 
law, but that lesser law. the law of Mjjses as it is called, was not destroyed 
by the coming of Christ. He said he came not to destroy it, but to fulfil 
it, and it was fulfilled, indeed superseded by the gospel. The gospel jn- 
cluded and includes everything in the law of Moses that is required for 
the salvation of men. But the outward ordinances and tiaiivr,g 
exercises peculiar to the law of Moses were largely done away w'th, for 
the schoolmaster had been in a manner efficient, and had brought 
his wilful, recreant, ofttimes stubborn pupils to a partial understand- 
ing of the higher law. Many of us think that with the passing of 
the law of Moses, the requirements of sacrifice passed. Nay, nay, the 
law of sacrif'ce is in operation today : but it is not accompanied by the 
outward form and manner of offerings that were characteristic of that 
ordinance in the day of Moses and during the Mosaic dispensation. 

THE PRESENT A DAY OF GATHERING 

Tlie present is the day of gathering, when Israel are being as- 
sembled from even the outermost parts of the earth, when the Lord 
has reached out his hand again to ga'her his people. This work 
is in. progress at such a rate that soon shall the ancient prophecv and 
promise be realized, as voiced by Jeremiah : "Therefore, behold, the 
days come, saith the Lord, that it shall no more be said. The Lord 
liveth, that brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt; 

"But, The Lord liveth, that brought up the clv'ldren of Israel 
from the land of the north, and from all the lands whither he had 
driven them : and I will bring them again into their land that I gave 
urvto their fathers." 

THE GOSPEL OF CHRIST RESTORED IN THIS DAY 



In this day of gathering the Lord has restored the gospel of 



ELDER JAMES E. T ALU AGE 



143 



Jesus Christ, and he has done it in the way predicted, the way, his 
way, and therefore the best way to make it most impressive. He re- 
quires of Israel today those same signs and symbols of their profes- 
sions, of their confessions, that were required of them of old. His 
people today, if they are his people indeed, must be worshipers of the 
true and the living God; not worshipers of some conception of ars 
immaterial being, a nondescript nothing that fills all space and can 
nowhere be found, but a living God, after whose physical, mental and 
spiritual likeness man has been created. God the Father is such a 
being, as has been made known to us by revelation of his very person ; 
and Jesus Christ is such a being. Both Jesus Christ and the Father 
have been seen and heard in this day and age. 

THE CHOSEN PEOPLE OF GOD MUST OBSERVE HIS SABBATHS 

If we be the people of Israel, the chosen people of God, as is 
our high profession, we must be thus characterized. Then, whatever 
shall be the fancies and fantasies of the world, let us be true to the 
living God, the God who with his Son Jesus Christ, was manifested 
to the youthful seeker after truth, afterward the Prophet Joseph 
Smith. We accept the God of our fathers in all literalness. We find 
that we can come much nearer unto him by that acceptance. We, the 
chosen of God, must show forth those distinguishing works specified 
by him. Are we observing his Sabbaths? Where do we stand, oh 
Israel? Is the reproach to come upon us? Are we polluting that 
holy day by pandering to our own lust after pleasure, after our own 
laziness, or perchance, giving ourselves up to the pursuit of wealth 
on that day? It is the Lord's dav, not ours. He has given us six, 
but the seventh is his, and he demands tjiat we shall recognize it 
as his and devote every hour of that clay to his service. How do we 
stand, where is that sign showing forth in our lives and in our work 
as individuals and as families? Is there a sign over your door, oh 
Latter-day Saints, showing that you are strict observers of the Sab- 
bath, or have you been swept away by this tide of apostasy that is 
ever seeking to engulf? 

i 

TITHING A SIGN OF THE GREAT BROTHERHOOD OF GOD 

Are we showing forth this other sign of the great brotherhood of 
God, the sanctifying of our means by setting as ; de the Lord's tenth 
aj sacred, and as holy? We have no right to use it, it is not ours, it 
is the Lord's. Let us be true to our colors, to our covenants, to our 
station as representatives of the hving God, his children, his covenant 
ch'ldren, I pray, in the Lord's name. Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ELDER CHARLES W. NIBLEY 

(Presiding Bishop of the Church) 

This is a very wonderful gathering ; and I believe that those who 
have, attended the meetings of this conference have been well paid. 1 
don't remember having attended any conference for lo, these many years, 
where I have been so thrilled in rryr spirit with the remarks of the 
brethren, the testimonies of the divine Spirit, and the singing as well, 
and the prayers that have been uttered, as at this conference. 

THE CHURCH IS OUT OF DEBT 

For the short time that I shall occupy I should like to turn from 
the feast of spiritual matters with which you have been fed, to the 
temporal. First of all I want to congratulate you, my brethren and 
sisters, and the whole Church, for to it I extend congratulations, also 
and especially to the Trustee-in-Trust of the Church, on the fact which 
was announced by the President on Friday — that the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints is entirely out of debt. This result has been 
accomplished much more quickly than I had ever hoped it could be. 
I did hope that I would live long enough to see the Church once again out 
of debt ; but I thought, in the very nature of things, it must take several 
years. Now, in a year and a half from the time the Trustee-in-Trust 
was compelled to borrow large sums of money to save certain institu- 
tions in which the Church and the people of the Church were largely 
and directly interested, that debt has been wiped out. Now the Church 
has enough means to pay every dollar, and more than enough, and it 
is entirely out of debt, except for little current matters of a few dollars. 
I praise the Lord with all my heart for this great blessing; and T hope 
that never during my lifetime, will I see, or be under the necessity ot 
seeing, that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints will ever 
be in debt again. 

STAY WITH THE FARM 

At the opening session of our conference our President gave us a 
splendid talk on practical affairs, advising the Saints to stick to their 
farms. Too many people who are reared on farms say, "Well, I want 
my children to have a better chance than I have had. I've had to 
work pretty hard, and I think we will move to town where the chil- 
dren will grow up and be educated, and they will have it a little 
eas : er than we have had it — than father and mother have had it." Well, 
now, there is such a thing as a man working too hard, and many of us, 
many of you farmers, do work altogether too hard. I was brought up 
on a farm mvself, and I had to work verv hard, and many of you in 
'hese times, I am sure, work too hard. There is wisdom in working; 
but, after all, isn't work a good thing? Is is not written that "in the 
sweat of thy face thou shalt eat thy bread." I. don't think it is a good 
thing to instil into the hearts of our children that they should find some

soft snap, or easy job, which does not require much work. Let nie say, 
my brethren and sisters, that the m.'ti with a nice little farm — not too 
large, but large enough — out of debt, is the king among men. He is 
an example to us all. He produces possibly all that he and his family 
require to live on ; what clothes they need he has a chance to get for 
himself and family just as well as anybody else. And I heartily endorse 
the counsel of President Grant, to stick to the farm. It is good, sound 
counsel. It is wrong to run off into speculation ; to get our farms 
heavily mortgaged so that we finally have to get up and leave them. 
The counsel to secure good, comfortable homes for our families; to own 
our own homes, and to keep out of debt, has been the counsel from this 
stand from President Brigham Young down to this very day, and it is 
just as good and sound advice today as it was in the days of President 
Brigham Young. 

LET US FOSTER THE RIGHT KIND OF EDUCATION 

Then, again, I think at times that we are too anxious that our chil- 
dren should shine in educational matters. I am a friend of education ; 
I have always felt the lack of schooling, for I never had any. So I 
am proud when statistics are read, as they were here the other morning 
by our President, showing the excellence of the work of our schools 
and the large number of children attending our colleges and universities. 
But sometimes I think that even as there is reason in working, so also 
there is reason in schooling. We ought not to go school-crazy. When 
a boy goes through the eighth grade and then the high school, then 
three or four years in a university, and then in a finishing off school, or 
something of that kind, the boy is twenty-five years old. There is a 
quarter of a century of his life spent in educating him. Somebody else 
has worked for the food he has eaten, and for the clothes that he has 
been supplied with for a full quarter of a century, which has been all 
spent in giving him education. He comes back home and he knows a 
lot ; bless your soul, he can tell you pretty much about everything, but 
he doesn't know how to do scarcely anything. (Laughter.) I believe 
it would be better if our children did not have quite so much book 
knowledge, and had a little more practical knowledge of hard work, 
being taught how to do things. If they knew how to make an acre 
of land produce double what it has hitherto been producing, wouldn't 
that be something to be proud of ? I remember riding from here to 
Kaysv : lle a few years ago with Brother John R. Barnes, a very splendid 
practical man, whom most of vou will remember. .We were talking 
about raising sugar beets, and I said, "Brother Barnes, how is it you 
can afford to raise sugar beets on your land here in Kaysville, land 
worth three or four or five hundred dollars an acre, raising ten, eleven, 
or twelve f ons of sugar beets," "Oh, bless your soul, Brother Nibley," 
said he, "I could not afford to farm that way. My land has to pro- 
duce twenty and twenty-five tons of sugar beets to the acre ; that is the 
way I farm." Now, if his land could be made so productive, can't 



148 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



yours, if it is cultivated in the same intelligent manner? We can increase 
production. President Grant emphasized the fact that the producer, the 
man who produces something, is the man to be looked up to, and we take 
our hats off to him. The man who merely makes his living by specu- 
lating and never produces anything, is not the kind of man, after all. 

TEACH THE YOUNG PEOPLE TO BE THRIFTY AND SELF-DENYING 

Another thing — and I see by the clock I must hurry — how many 
children are there who are taught the habits of thrift and saving in 
these days ; taught to deny themselves ? Why, they don't know what 
self denial is. They go to picture shows four or five or six times a 
week. Do they save anything? Do you tell them : "You can go to a 
picture show once a week, and - not any oftener" ? Why they would 
think, that is awful. "Oh, you are just persecuting us." I want to say 
that it would be infinitely better if they could be restrained from going 
to excesses in amusement. You do not learn very much at picture 
shows, anyhow. There are some pictures that are educational, but most 
of the pictures that I have seen would make the angels weep! (Laughter.) 
They are not worth looking at ; nothing but trash. Then, your children 
would be better at home. Teach your children to put that money in 
the bank and deny themselves something. I want to say, brethren and 
sisters, that in the process of education, if you put them through 
the eight grades, then through the high school, and then send them on 
a mission of two years or more, you will find the mission infinitely 
better, as an education, than all they will get at any school ; unless, in- 
deed, it is some one person here and there, one in a thousand, who has 
some special faculty or aptitude in some given direction, who should be 
trained. With these exceptions, I think a mission is better than excess 
of school books — the missionary education is the best in all the world. 

IMPORTANT ITEMS FOR GIRLS TO KNOW 

Teach them to be saving, to stick to the land. Teach the girls 
what girls should be taught. I don't care how much money we have, 
the girls should be taught how to work and earn their living ; how to 
make a batch of good bread ; how to make a bowl of good soup : what to 
do with baby when it has the colic. (Laughter.) They don't know. 
Where is there one in a hundred who is taught these things ? Oh, bless 
your soul; oh, no, not that, but only book learning 1 ! Why, these 
are some of the most important things in the world for a girl to know. 
If I were a young fellow seeking a girl to marry I wouldn't care whether 
she could tell me all about these book things — • how far it is, say, from 
here to the moon — what do I care about that? What I would want 
to know is: "Can you make good soup?" (Laughter.) "If you can't 
you're not the kind of a girl I want." 

YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN SHOULD MARRY 

Another thing: I think that we should be taught that our young 



BISHOP CHARLES W. NlBLEY 



149 



people should marry. This way of putting marriage off until you are 
twenty-five or thirty years of age, or longer, is all wrong. Young folks 
claim that it is because they have not the means to get married. Haven't 
you any faith? Won't the Lord open up the way, if you try to keep 
his commandments ? Well, that is one of his commandments. Why not 
have some faith and then work, and get the girl to consent and 
share it with you in the work — to be a real help meet, not altogether a 
help eat. ( Laughter. ) I once heard of a young fellow who had married a 
girl — she had a fair education, but he got tired of everlastingly eating 
baker's bread. One day he said : "L">arie, I wish we had some real 
biscuits like my mother used to make." She said : "You can have, I 
guess. If you will buy a sack of flour I will put it to soak tonight." 
(Laughter.) 

CONCLUDING ADMONITIONS 

My time has expired. Stick to the farm. Render obedience — 
willing obedience, loving loyalty, to the counsel of the President of this 
Church. Stick to the farm; stay with your land; teach thrift; teach 
the principles of the gospel by sending your sons and daughters on mis- 
sions when you can, for it is the best education in all the world. I bear 
witness that this is the work of God ; it is not man's. I thought here 
today if we were dependent, this great organization, if we were depend- 
ing, upon the wisdom of man to manage it, my goodness, what a fix 
we would be irl! The Lord God Almighty is at the head. He it is 
who is managing and directing, and all honor and glory and power to 
him, forever and ever, through Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 

MODERATION THE MARK OF A GENTLEMAN. 

There is an old saying that "Moderation is the mark of a gentle- 
man." I have thought that with certain limitations that attribute might 
consistently be applied to and accepted by Latter-day Saints. It is our 
excesses which give us our chief concern and trouble. Moderation 
begets tolerance, and tolerance lies at the foundation of sympathy and 
charity. These qualities underlie love, which is the crowning attri- 
bute of both men and God. I wish it were possible for all of us 
to enjoy in moderation the splendid things which God has given to us. 
Nearly every good thing can be carried to excess. Good practices oft- 
en become bad practice by too frequent indulgence, just as has been 
pointed out here this afternoon. 

We have had most excellent counsel, with reference to the man- 
ner in which we should conduct our affairs. We have been admon- 
ished to be thrifty, to be saving and to keep out of debt ; and yet I 
do not interpret these instructions to mean that we should necessarily 



150 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



forego all the comforts and the privileges which life affords. 1 re- 
member one of the last sermons delivered by our late President Joseph 
F. Smith. It has always stayed with me. I recall that he said in sub- 
stance, that it was not intended that the Latter-day Sa,ints should be 
a poor people. He said that the righteous should inherit the earth and 
that the good things of life, those which are really worth having, 
should come to them who keep and obey the commandments and the 
laws of God. 

WE SHOULD LIVE WITHIN OUR MEANS 

I take it that when our President wisely counsels us against go- 
ing into debt for the purchase of those things which are called lux- 
uries, he desires that we should live within our means, that we should 
be moderate in the comforts which we try to secure for ourselves and 
our families; and yet, I assume that he does not intend that we should 
be deprived of all the fine things which have come from invention 
and from inspiration to man as I verily believe it to be, for the com- 
fort and the convenience of mankind. I thought as he spoke of the 
automobile, that he would not advise us to give up entirely this splen- 
did vehicle which serves such good purpose in so many different lines 
of endeavor ; and yet I gather that it is prudent and wise for us not 
to indulge in the purchase of these vehicles to such an extent that we 
burden ourselves with obligations and put ourselves under bondage, 
against the counsel which has been given for years and years to trie 
Latter-day Saints. I am thoroughly converted to the thought that 
people who operate automobiles waste as much as"one half of the legit- 
imate cost of the operation of these machines. I go about the coun- 
try and I see farmers who have bought cars, — some expensive and some 
less expensive — operating them without proper care. Lack of proper 
care results in dreadful loss, because of the nature of these vehicles and 
because it costs so much to keep and maintain them in proper repair. 

I gather, too, that many men might support their families in more 
of luxury and comfort if they would but use reasonable care for the 
things which they have and the things which they acquire. 

THRIFT AND ECONOMY. 

As I understand it, therefore, it is not only in self denial and in 
forbearance to purchase the things which we desire, that thrift and 
economy consists, but in the proper preservation and use of the things 
with which we are blessed ; and I would urge upon my fellow mem- 
bers of the Church a more careful and thoughtful attention to all 
these various items that go into our economic life and that feature 
so largely in our successes or in our failures. 

THE PRINCIPLE OF CONSECRATION 

It is the excesses of the rich that accentuate the poverty of the 



ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 



151 



poor, and if those who are largely possessed of this world's goods 
would be more moderate in the use of their possessions, they would be 
able to make larger contributions to the alleviation of the suffering 
and degradation of the poor; and I take it that if one of the great 
principles of our faith were properly and adequately observed, that we 
would have very little difficulty about these excesses. That is the 
principle of consecration. If we were to consider all the property 
which the Lord has given to us as coming to us in the form of trust 
property which' we, as stewards, are to use for the advancement of 
his work and the establishment of his kingdom, even though all of 
that property is not turned in to the coffers of the Church, it would 
surely be devoted to worthy purposes. I regard the obligation upon 
.the members of the Church to use everything which the Lord has given 
to them for the advancement of the Lord's work as being equally ob- 
ligatory as the law of tithing itself ; for I can not think that a man has 
done his full duty by the Church and to the Lord when he simply con- 
trihutes one-tenth of his income or his interest annually. I think that 
he ought to proceed upon the assumption that every good thing which 
God has blessed him with is to be used by him under the inspiration 
of God's Holy Spirit for the advancement and the establishment of 
this work. And how shall the work be established? I say that it 
shall be established at least in large measure by every man so build- 
ing up and maintaining the institution of the home, that the Church 
is really made up of an aggregation of the finest homes which may 
be found any place over the broad face of this earth ; and any man 
who does so proceed will find great comfort and joy in the use of the 
funds and the means which God has given to him, for he will know 
Jhat all these things that come to him have really been returned to 
God ; because there is no way by which they may be returned to him 
except by using them in the advancement and for the welfare of his 
children. 

LET US USE AND ENJOY ALL GOOD THINGS WITHIN OUR MEANS 

Therefore, my brethren and my sisters, I would urge that we be 
careful, that we be moderate, and that we avoid the excesses which 
have been mentioned in this conference. 

I know that it is the disposition of the leaders of the Church to 
foster and cultivate refinement, beauty and art, and all of those good 
things that make life more worth living. I do not believe for a mo- 
ment that there is any member of the presiding councils of the Church 
who would have our people return to those days when women were 
deprived of the necessary conveniences in homes. I cannot think for 
an instant that it would be advantageous to dispense with the modern 
systems of plumbing and sanitation which have rendered our homes 
and communities far better places in which to live ; and I cannot think 
that there is any desire to do away with the proper things that we 



152 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



need to carry on our lives in a way that is compatible with the spirit 
of the gospel and its teachings. 

All that we need to do to feel comfortable and to feel good in our 
hearts is to live according to the advice of the brethren, — within our 
means, — to avoid excesses, and to let moderation and reason dictate 
the course and the policy of our lives. 

God grant that every man and every woman may have the in- 
spiration to which they are entitled by good living far the guidance 
of their lives; .and that they may know how to act under all circum- 
stances. That blessing will come, I believe as I stand here, to everyone 
who keeps the commandments and follows the counsel of the priesthood 
of the Church. May his blessings attend us during the season when we 
shall be confronted with temptation, when we shall be beset by all the 
various practices of the world which call for our indulgence, that we 
may have the power to resist, that we may never compromise the 
truth, but that we may enjoy the goodness and the gifts of God, I pray 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

President Heber J. Grant asked that if Elder William A. Morton, 
lately returned from a mission to Great Britain, was in the congre- 
gation, for him to please come to the stand. Elder Morton was in the 
congregation at the Bureau of Information, heard the call, and appeared 
before the congregation. 



ELDER WILLIAM A. MORTON 

I heard the president call me when I was standing at the Bureau 
of Information. As you know, I have just returned from another 
mission to Great Britain. I would have been perfectly willing to have 
stayed another year, yes, ten years, if the authorities of the Church 
had desired me to do so ; but I am very glad to be back in Zion. 

A man on hearing an Irishman boast of his country — before the 
Home Rule bill was passed, said to him, "What makes you think so 
much of Ireland ?" The answer he received was, "Other lands." What 
makes me think so much of this land? Other lands. What makes me 
think so much of this people? Other people. What makes me 
think so much of my religion? Other religions. Sister Morton and 
I have been in other lands, among other people, and we have come 
back with a far greater love in our hearts for Zion and her people than 
we ever had before. 

I remember reading in the JDoctrine and Covenants what the 
Lord said to the Prophet Joseph Smith, that lying spirits had gone 
abroad in the earth. A large number of them have taken up their 
residence in the Old Country. A minister who returned some time 
ago from a visit to the United States, delivered in his church an illus- 



ELDER WILLIAM A. MORTON 



153 



trated lecture of his trip, and what do you think he told the people? 
That when he was in Salt Lake City he was given a banquet at which 
he sat beside the mayor, who was the husband of three wives. ( Laugh- 
ter.) And the audience believed him! (Laughter.) That was pub- 
lished in a daily paper. I immediately wrote the editor, asking him if 
the minister had been reported correctly. He answered that he had, 
and I then denounced the statement as a malicious falsehood. I told 
the readers of the paper that I knew the mayor of Salt Lake City; 
that he was at one time a member of my Sunday school class ; that he 
is not and never was a polygamist. Then the minister had to tell 
another lie, in order to prop the first one up, for, as you know, a lie 
cannot stand alone. He said he did not refer to the present mayor, 
but to a former mayor. I wrote the editor of the paper, telling him 
that there has not been a polygamist mayor in Salt Lake City for thirty- 
eight years. Think of a Methodist minister telling such falsehoods ! 

Another minister, a minister of the English Church, told the 
people of England that when "Mormons" get tired of their old wives, 
they take them into the desert, leave them beside a, spring, and bring 
them provisions from time to time. (Laughter). He said that he him- 
self had rescued quite a number of young women from the clutches of 
"Mormons." Think of that out of the mouth of a consecrated min- 
ister of the Church of England! And thousands believed him. Why? 
Because they would rather believe a lie than the truth. 

My time is up. I thank God with all my heart and soul for the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ which I embraced in my native land thirty-five 
years ago. I love this work, I love this people ; I would rather live 
here on bread and water all the days of my life, than to live in the pal- 
ace of the king. I pray God to help us to be grateful and thankful and 
to appreciate his blessings, because I know that if we are faithful in 
keeping his commandments his blessings will continue to flow unto 
us. God bless you all, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 

Today is Sunday ; the hour is 3 :45 p. m. I am, reminded that 
at this very hour, Sunday, April 7, 1918, one day more than five years 
ago, I was presented to the General Conference, by President Joseph 
F. Smith, as the new member of the Council of the Twelve. 

THE VALUE OF PERSECUTION 

It hardly seems possible that in these days, when information as 
to the world is so generally published, and when practically all the 
people, in all the countries of the world are able to read this information, 
the people of one of our great civilized countries can be induced to 
accept as true the intensely false statements to which Elder William 
A. Morton in his remarks has just referred. Is it not necessary for 



154 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

I 

such assertions and statements to be made in order to fulfil the pre- 
dictions which are so clearly and numerously made in the holy scrip- 
tures ? For example : "And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's 
sake: but he that endureth to the end shall be saved." (Matthew 10:22.) 
"Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecu- 
tion." (II Timothy 3 :12.) "Blessed are they which are persecuted for 
righteousness' sake; for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are 
ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all 
manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake. Rejoice, and be ex- 
ceeding glad : for great is your reward in heaven : for so persecuted they 
the prophets which were before you." (Matthew 5 :10-12.) "Woe unto 
you, when all men shall speak well of you ! for so did their fathers 
to the false prophets." (Luke 6:26.) The great Master himself, said: 
"If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you. 
If ye be of the world, the world would love his own ; but because ye are 
not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the 
world hateth you." (John 15 :18, 19.) 

THE WELFARE AND TRAINING OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE 

I shall attempt to place additional emphasis upon two subjects that 
have been discussed by many of the speakers during this conference. 
One is the arousing' of additional interest in the training and welfare 
of the young people of the Church. The other is the importance of 
having Latter-day Saints remain in this section of the country and of 
rearing their families generally on the farm. 

Marvelous transformations have taken place since that memorable 
day in July, 1847, when Brigham Young and his band of noble pio- 
neers looked over the mountain tops into this great valley, arid said : 
"This is the place." The great pioneer leader looked with the vision 
of a prophet. He spoke the truth. "This is the place." Not the place 
for making the most money, perhaps, not the place in which the great- 
est amount of luxury can be found ; but it is the chosen place for Lat- 
ter-day Saints. It is the place where struggles must be met — those 
struggles which make men and women. It is not gold or silver, nor 
is it what these can purchase, that is most desired by Latter-day Saints. 
What we want is sons and daughters strong in the power to resist; 
sons and daughters with high ideals and exalted ambition, for these 
'give joy and satisfaction which no amount of money can purchase. 
It is in these young people — our most valuable asset — we are most 
interested. 

AN ILLUSTRATION FROM BABSON 

Is not Roger W. Babson our greatest statistician? It is he who 
says he was visiting the home of a famous manufacturer, who took him 
out to his farm and showed him his cattle. Above the head of each 
heifer and cow was the pedigree. The most careful record was kept 
of every animal. He had a blue print in his library at home of every 
one of these animals. Later in the evening — it was during the Christmas 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 



155 



vacation — a young fellow drove up to the house in a fancy automobile, 
and he came in and asked for the manufacturer's daughter, in order 
to take her to a party. Not liking the looks of the fellow ver.y well, 
after the couple had gone out, Mr. Babson said: 'Who is that chap?" 
The father replied : "Oh, I don't know, just some friend of Mary's." 
Mr. Babson says this father had every one of his cows blue-printed, 
but he didn't even know the name of the man who came to get his only 
daughter, and who did not deliver her until two o'clock the next morn- 
ing. That man was neglecting the welfare of the human soul — the 
world's greatest asset. 

As I have said before, this may not be the place to find the greatest 
amount of money, or the greatest quality of luxury ; but it is "the place" 
designated by divine Providence for the Latter-day Saints, and it is 
the place where, with divine help and guidance, we are struggling to 
produce the best men and the best women that can be produced in any 
Ipart of the world. I believe "this is the place" for accomplishing 
this great end. 

THE VALUE OF THE MISSION FIELD AS AN EDUCATOR 

Intensely interested as we are in developing to the highest degree the 
virtues of our young men and young women and also their talents, 
may I add a little emphasis on what Bishop Nibley has already said, 
and also Elder Stephen L. Richards, that I regard the experience in 
the mission field as a great educational asset to any young man. While 
my lifetime has been spent almost entirely in the school room, either as 
student or teacher, I am of the opinion that for the average young man 
time spent in the mission field is, even for him, more valuable than 
an equal amount of time spent in the school room. Character certainly 
is worth more than education without it. Young missionaries who go 
into the mission field make an intense study of the life and example of 
Jesus Christ. I ask all good people everywhere if the amount of time 
ordinarily spent in the mission field could be devoted to any more 
worthy or helpful work. If you have to choose between sending your 
children to school for higher education, or sending them into the mis- 
sion field, I say, choose the latter. 

THE M. I. A. GIVE SUPPORT TO THIS HELPFUL ORGANIZATION 

Since I happen to be one of the general superintendency of the 
Young Men's Mutual Improvement Association, I am naturally in- 
tensely interested in the welfare of the young people, and especially the 
young men. I appeal for you to give the Mutual Improvement work 
your earnest, honest support. Your boys are calling for you. They 
need your help. "Of all sad words of tongue or pen, the saddest are 
these: It might have been." What greater anguish can come into 
the human heart than that which results from regret? Be close to your 
son. Put your arms around him. Enjoy his affection and enjoy his 
confidence. It is this sort of spirit we are encouraging in the Mutual 



156 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Improvement organizations. "Train up a child in the way he should 
go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it." 

the "m" men 

At Richfield a few weeks ago my heart was filled with pride at 
seeing our "M" men, a portion of the Mutual Improvement Association, 
,give the Sunday evening program, for the M. I. A. meeting. Every 
detail was arranged by these young men. Thus we are aiming to give 
at home a training similar to that received in the mission field. That 
is, we are aiming to give that training that takes a young, laughing, silly 
boy, and makes of him, as the mission almost always does, a fine, dig- 
nified, glorious man. 

THE FATHERS AND SONS' AND SCOUT ACTIVITIES 

Scout work is a portion of the Mutual Improvement program. We 
desire to make our stake and ward officials give to this portion of the 
program the same good support they do to other portions of our work, 
in this city, during the last two weeks, I have attended three banquets 
given by the scouts and their fathers. This intimate association of 
fathers and sons cannot do otherwise than result in doing great good. 
What can give greater uplift than to have boys in the most critical 
moments of their lives intimately associated with, and positively guided 
by, their fathers and their mothers ? 

The subject assigned to one of these scouts, and put in the lan- 
'guage of the modern boy, was: "My Dad — My Pal." It was thrill- 
ing to see that bright-eyed little chap with head erect, his hand on his 
father's shoulder, tell the great group of fathers and sons assembled 
that he and his dad were chums. When at the close of the banquet 
contributions were solicited for buying a truck for the scout troop, 
some men gave one dollar, a few gave five. This little fellow came 
forward and put down a check and said : "My dad gives twenty-five 
dollars." 

MOTHER, THE BEST SCOUT OF ALL 

A fine looking, dark-haired Scandinavian mother was sitting at 
another table, and by her side her little son. This boy was asked to 
respond to the toast: "Mother, the best scout of all." You ought to 
have heard his story. The little fellow, somewhat frail in body, was 
as light in complexion as his mother was dark. With quivering lips 
he said: "During all the days of my boyhood my mother has taught 
me to. pray. Sometime ago I went down to Utah Lake with a group 
of my companions on a swimming trip. We were carrying on one 
contest after another. I found myself actually exhausted, when I 
saw one of my little friends and companions in deep water, drowning." 
There were many strong men with strong hearts in that audience. All 
listened in breathless silence to the simple narrative of this little scout. 
The hearers could not hold back the tears, when the little fellow said : 
"And, remembering the teachings of my mother, that, under all con- 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 



157 



ditions, I should place my trust in divine Providence, I uttered a 
prayer, placed my trust in Him, then went forward and saved the life 
of my little friend." That is the spirit of the scouts. Scouting is a 
portion of our M. I. A. program. 

HIGH IDEALS IN TWO SLOGANS 

In the L. D. S. Church we have every doctrine, every principle, 
every practice, every element, that tends to make men and women 
better, happier, stronger, cleaner. In the language of the Boy Scouts, 
we are struggling to do our duty to God and to our country. We are 
struggling to make good citizens, for only out of good citizens can 
good Latter-day Saints be made. We are striving to make better men 
and women than are made or can be made elsewhere. We expect 
to accomplish this greatly desired end by living more strictly in con- 
formity with the teachings and example of Jesus Christ, than do others. 
Our slogans are an indication of our standards. One of these is : 
"We stand for the non-sale and non-use of tobacco." This year's 
slogan is : "We stand for a pure life through clean thought and action." 
With these high ideals we are going forward with faith in divine Provi- 
dence, expecting to produce a generation of people better than any 
the world has known. 

The Lord bless you. Be interested in the boy. Give him a fair 
share of your time. Give him your confidence. Do not be satisfied 
until in your ward there is an efficient troop of Boy Scouts in which 
your son can be trained. Give splendid support to this portion of our 
Mutual Improvement work. You cannot know what real scouting 
is until you have at least one Eagle Scout in your troop. The Lord bless 
you. Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

While listening to Bishop Nibley I thought of some quotations 
from a book, a copy of which was sent by the Presidency to the 1775 
misionaries of our Church, .in all the world. This book is entitled 
Fundamentals of Prosperity, and the author is Roger W. Babson. I 
brought it here to hand to a friend after the meeting, and not for 
the purpose of reading from it, but some of the things that have been 
said this afternoon have caused me to turn to the book, and I desire 
to read some things from it, and to make a few comments : 

"The need of the hour is not more legislation. The need of the hour 
is more religion. More religion is needed everywhere, fro-m the halls of 
Congress at Washington, to the factories,^ the mines, the fields and the 
forests. It is one thing to talk about plans or policies, but a plan or policy 
without a religious motive is like a watch without a spring or a body with- 
out the breath of life." 

"Why is it that most of the able men in our great industries came 
from the country districts? The reason is that the country boy is trained 
to work. Statistics indicate that very seldom does a child, brought up in a 
city apartment house, amount to much; while the children of well-to-do

GENERAL CONEERENCE 



city people are seriously handicapped. The great educator of the previous 
generation was not the public school, but rather the wood box." 

There is hardly an individual in all the Church who has not some 
responsibilities. We have ward teachers, two of them for every block 
in all the Church. In addition, we have two Relief Society ' teachers 
for each block. There are a bishop and two counselors in every ward. 
There are from fifteen to twenty high counselors in every stake. Re- 
sponsibility develops people. I want to read just a word on respon- 
sibility, from Mr. Babson's book : 

My little girl has a black cat; about once in four months this cat has 
kittens. Opposite our place is a man who has an Airdale dog. When that 
dog comes across the street and that cat has no kittens, the cat immediate- 
ly "beats it" as fast as she can, with the dog after her. But when that 
dog comes across the street and that cat has the responsibility of some kit- 
tens, she immediately turns on the dog and the dog "beats it" with the cat 
after him. It is the same dog, the same cat, and the same back yard; 
but in one instance the cat has no responsibilities and in the other case she 
has. Responsibilities develop faith, vision, courage, initiative, and other 
things which make the world go round. 

I will read a comparison between the people who settled North and 
South America: 

Just before T went to Brazil I was_the guest of the President of the 
Argentine Republic. After lunching one day we sat in his sun parlor look- 
ing out over the river. Fie was very thoughtful. He said, "Mr. Babson, I 
have been wondering why it is that South America with all its natural 
advantages is so far behind North America notwithstanding that South 
America was settled before North America." Then he went on to tell how 
the forests of South America had two hundred and eighty-six trees that 
can be found in no book of botany. He told me about many ranches that 
had thousands of acres under alfalfa in one block. He mentioned the mines 
of iron, coal, qopper, silver, gold; all those great rivers and waterpowers 
which rival Niagara. "Why is it with all these natural resources, South 
America is so far behind North America?" he asked. Well, those of you 
who have been there know the reason. But, being a guest, I said: 

"Mr. President, what do you think is the reason?" 

He replied: "I have come to this conclusion. South America was set- 
tled by the Spanish who came to South America in search of gold, but 
North America was settled by the Pilgrim Fathers who went there in 
search of God. 

Friends, let us as American citizens never kick down the ladder by 
which we climbed up. Let us never forget the foundation upon which all 
permanent prosperity is based. 

That foundation is religion, faith in God and determination to 
serve God. Our fathers came here for the gospel of the Lord Jesus 
Christ and for nothing else. 

Again, I say to the Latter-day Saints, that we can rear better 
citizens and better Latter-day Saints upon the farms than in any other 
place. Mr. Babson goes on to say that over thirty per cent of all the 
great men in the industries today have come from the farms, or are sons 
of poor preachers. < : ' ' 1 ' i 

May the Lord bless the people of Zion. May we keep his com-

mandments in a way and manner that all men, seeing our good deeds, 
our honesty, our integrity, may be led at least to respect us, whether 
they believe in our faith or not. God bless you. Amen. 

The choir sang, "Then shall your light shine," and the congre- 
gation sang the "Doxology." 

The benediction was pronounced by Elder Peter G. Johnston, of 
the general auditing committee. 

Conference adjourned for six months. 

Professor Anthon C. Lund conducted the singing in the Taber- 
nacle; Professor J. J. McClellan played the accompaniments, interludes, 
etc., on the great organ, assisted by Edward P. Kimball and Tracy 
Y. Cannon. 

Stenographic reports of the discourses were made in the Taber- 
nacle by Franklin W. Otterstrom, assisted by Joseph Anderson ; and 
in the Assembly Hall by Clyde Rasmussen. 

Edward H. Anderson, Clerk of the Conference.

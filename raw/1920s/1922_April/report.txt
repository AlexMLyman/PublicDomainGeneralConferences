GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



John M. Knight, Western States, Joseph W. McMurrin, California; 
Heber C. Iverson, Northwestern States ; Rey L. Pratt, Mexico ; Nephi 
Jensen, Canada ; and Benjamin Goddard, Bureau of Information, Tem- 
ple Block, Salt Lake City. 

The Tabernacle was filled, every seat being occupied, both in the 
gallery and in the body of the building, with people from all parts of 
the Church. 

The choir and congregation sang, "Come, come, ye Saints, no toil 
nor labor fear." 

The opening prayer was offered by Elder Alonzo A. Hinckley, 
President of the Deseret stake of Zion. 

The choir and congregation sang the hymn, "Zion stands with 
hills surrounded." 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I am delighted once more to have the opportunity of meeting with 
the Latter-day Saints in General Conference assembled. I am pleased 
indeed to see so large a congregation here today, considering the in- 
clement weather of some months past, and the great need of our 
farming community to stay at home to prepare their farms for the 
coming harvest. It shows the faith of the Latter-day Saints when 
they neglect their ordinary temporal affairs, and, upon a week day, 
assemble in such large numbers as we see here before us. I believe 
this is one of the largest congregations I have seen for a number of 
years, except on the Sabbath day, of Conference when, as you know, 
the building is overcrowded and we have to hold overflow meet- 
ings. 

THE INSPIRATIONS FROM A NOTED HYMN 

I never hear the opening hymn, "Come, come, ye Saints, no toil 
nor labor fear, but with joy wend your way," but that my heart goes 
out in gratitude and thanksgiving to God for these wonderful men 
and women who sang this hymn, day after day, and week after week, 
and month after month, as they were crossing the plains, coming fif- 
teen hundred miles from the city of Nauvoo, where, as you know, 
they had been expelled by a mob. A gentleman said to me in substance, 
when I sang him this hymn one day as I was taking him up one of our 
beautiful canyons, "Mr. Grant, I have never heard a single verse of 
any hymn that has impressed me more with an absolute and perfect 
faith in the immortality of the soul of man than that last verse in 
your hymn, 'Come, come, ye Saints.' " Previously he had asked me 
for a copy of the hymn which I gave him, and in addition, I had 
given him a copy of The Songs of Zion. 

"And should we die before our journey's through, happy day, all 
is well. We then are free from toil and sorrow too, with the just 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT

we shall dwell." I am convinced that every one of the people who 
traveled a thousand miles over an almost trackless trail to these val- 
leys of the mountains, and who sang this hymn, had an absolutely 
abiding testimony in their hearts and souls of the immortality of man. 
There is no doubt in the mind of any Latter-day Saint that the body 
shall be literally resurrected, that we shall meet God, our Father, in 
whose image we were made, that we shall meet our Redeemer, our 
elder brother, the Son of the living God. We have in very deed 
found the place which God for us prepared. We have in very deed 
been blessed of God. We have become, as the Prophet Joseph Smith 
predicted, a mighty people in the midst of the Rocky Mountains. He 
said that the Saints should continue to suffer much persecution and 
affliction, that many should be put to death by our persecutors, and 
others should live to go and assist in building cities and making set- 
tlements and should become a great and a mighty people in the midst 
of the Rocky Mountains. This part of the country was then con- 
sidered a worthless tract ; it was put down upon the maps as the "Great 
American Desert," but the inspiration of the living God to Joseph 
Smith as shown by the prophecy that he uttered and had recorded, 
was that we were to come here; and we have come here, and we have 
become a mighty people in the midst of these mountains. Brigham 
Young announced that in vision the Lord had shown him this valley, 
and when he stood upon the hill to the east and saw the valley, he said 
"This is the place." When I think of this great building erected by 
him and remember that the few nails used in it cost at the rate of 
$1.00 a pound, and that it is held together with wooden pins and tied 
with raw-hide — when I think of the erection of this building and the 
organ here and all the great things that were accomplished under the 
direction of that wonderful pioneer, especially when I hear this hymn, 
my heart goes out in gratitude, that I, too, had a father who was one 
of those who came here in early days as a pioneer and that he had in 
his heart the love of God and the faith that God had prepared a place 
for us, far away in the West. 

CONCERNING THE GREAT SUGAR INDUSTRY OF THE 
INTERMOUNTAIN COUNTRY 

I have received a communication asking me if I did not think I 
had charged a little bit too much when I received $900,000 commis- 
sion for raising $2,100,0001 to help out the Utah-Idaho Sugar Company. 
I did not get one dollar of commission, neither did the "Mormon" 
Church get a dollar of commission ; but the "Mormon" Church used 
its credit for $2,100,000 to buy $3,000,000 of preferred stock, (less 
the limited amount which the share holders took, which was a little 
less, as I remember it, than 10 per cent of the capital stock). We 
did this to save the sugar industry, and I spent weeks of my time bor- 
rowing money for the Church — something we do not like to do, and

would not have done except to save a great industry, for the benefit 
of the farmers and the stockholders of the company. 

I want to say to the Latter-day Saints that the first beet sugar 
factory ever built in the United States of America, with American 
machinery, was built by the people of Utah, at Lehi ; but for the fact 
that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints used its credit 
and borrowed the money to build that factory, during the panic of 
1891, that factory would never have been built. I was utilized by 
President Woodruff and his counselors as the financial agent of 
the Church, and I went to New York, to Boston, to Hartford, to 
Philadelphia, to San Francisco and other places, and borrowed money 
upon the credit of the Church to finish that factory, for the people 
who had subscribed for stock in it, because of the panic, failed to ful- 
fil their pledges. It is only fair to say that many of the bankers were 
not willing to loan money to build that factory, even to the Church, 
because banks were failing all over the country. I made a proposi- 
tion to the bank that loaned the last $100,000 for the building of the 
factory that if the banker, the cashier and manager of Wells Fargo 
Bank of San Francisco, would write the names of twenty-five of 
the strongest financial men in Salt Lake City who were "Mormons" 
I would promise that twenty out of that twenty-five would individually 
and collectively guarantee the payment of the $100,000. i used 
to be his office boy in Salt Lake City when he was the manager of 
Wells Fargo Bank here, and I pleaded with him that as he believed in 
me as a boy, to believe in me now as a man and as one of the leaders 
of the "Mormon" Church. He laughed and said, "Why, Heber, that 
is an impossibility, no set of men on the face of the earth would 
guarantee four Church notes for $25,000 each. I said, "All I ask 
is for you to give me the privilege, and if I fail to get the twenty 
signatures, then I do not ask you to loan me the money." He said, 
"My boy, I will go you 100 per cent better; you offer me a margin 
of five; I will give you a margin of ten. I will write thirty names, 
and if you can get twenty out of the thirty, your Church can have 
the money." He wrote four or five, tore up the slip of paper, threw 
it in the waste-basket and said, "By the way, Heber, twelve or four- 
teen years have passed since I left Salt Lake, many a man who was 
wealthy then may be busted now ; I will just have my successor in 
Salt Lake write those thirty names and when you take him the notes 
he will pay you the money. I came home and the man wrote thirty 
names. I secured twenty-four signatures out of the thirty and three 
of the men on the list were out of the city, and I secured one endorser 
who was not on the list, the late David Eccles, who was worth more 
than any half dozen of the men who signed. David Eccles who heard 
me telling the story, asked me the question, "Is my name one of the 
thirty?" When I said, "No," he said, "I would like to look at those 
notes." I had said they were payable, one in six months, one in 
twelve months, one in eighteen months and one in twenty-four months.

He did not look at the face of them ; he turned them wrong side up 
and wrote his name on the back of them and said, "My name won't 
hurt them." Then he said, "You tell President Wilford Woodruff 
that David Eccles always keeps two or three hundred thousand dol- 
lars where he can put his hand on it by giving thirty days' notice, and 
that, as these notes fall due, if he will give me thirty days' notice, I 
will take them up, and he can pay me in one year or five years or ten 
years or whenever convenient. 

There is, perhaps, nothing more tiresome to an audience, ac- 
customed to hearing a man speak always without reading, than for 
him to read to them, but I am going to tire you by reading an edi- 
torial from the Improvement Era, entitled, "Integrity and Industry :" 

"In the practical religion of the Latter-day Saints, we find not only spirit- 
uality, but integrity; not only faith, but works" * * * * 

I may not have been a very good preacher of the gospel of the 
Lord, Jesus Christ, from the standpoint of doctrinal preaching, but 
I have endeavored, to the best of my ability, since I was called as a 
boy forty odd years ago, to preside over the Tooele stake of Zion, 
and forty years this coming October, to be one of the apostles of the 
Lord, Jesus Christ, to preach the doctrine of St. James, "I will show 
thee my faith by my works." He wanted men to show their faith by 
their works ; and I have announced to the Latter-day Saints time and 
time again from my first public speech lasting seven and a half min- 
utes, after my call to the ministry, +hat I did not ask any man to be 
a more honest tithe payer, or a more perfect observer of the Word of 
Wisdom, or to be a better observer of his family and secret prayers, 
or to be more liberal in proportion to his means, for the advance- 
ment of God's kingdom, than I would be ; and, thank the Lord, I 
have kept that promise, made to the people of Tooele. I believe in 
the Latter-day Saint who is honest with the Lord, God Almighty, 
who believes it a privilege to contribute to the Lord one-tenth of 
all that the Lord puts into his hands, I believe in the man who goes 
down on his knees and supplicates God every day of his life for the 
guidance that comes from above ; I believe in the man who observes 
the Word of Wisdom and who has faith enough not to take into his 
system those things that the Lord, God Almighty has revealed to us 
are not good for man. 

.<* * * * no (- on ly thrift, but industry, not only co-operation, but 
unselfish service. In a community where these characteristics predomi- 
nate, the consequence must necessarily result in a God-fearing, clean, loyal, 
prosperous and dependable people. 

"As an illustration of these remarks, we cite the wisdom displayed in 
the saving of the sugar industry of Utah and Idaho from the recent threat- 
ened disaster. The founding of the sugar industry was one of the grandest 
happenings that could come to the West, and is an illustration of the wis- 
dom, faith, and integrity of those who stood and who stand at its head. Had 
this great industry, which was seriously threatened, not been sustained 
and protected, the disastrous effects would indeed have been far-reaching..

and the loss most dreadful,, not only to business, but to individual producers 
as well. 

"In view of these facts, and considering the benefits to be derived from 
this accomplishment, the following statement, from one who is well-in- 
formed on the subject, must prove of great interest, both to manufacturers 
and farmers, as well as to the people in general: 

" 'For the various sugar companies of Utah and Idaho during the season 
of 1921, there were approximately 1601.000 acres of sugar beets grown by 
approximately 16,000 farmers. About half of this amount was raised for the 
Utah-Idaho Sugar Company. The 16,000 farmers delivered from the 160. - 
000 acres to the various companies in the two states approximately 1,600',- 

000 tons of beets, from which upwards of 4,000,000 bags of sugar have been 
manufactured, which- if sold at the present price of about $4.50 per bag, 
would amount to approximately $18,000,000, this being distributed, about 
one-half to the farmer, and the other half to the workmen and manufac- 
turers for material, etc. While the manufacturers of this sugar will un- 
doubtedly sustain a loss, unless the price of sugar increases, yet the benefits 
to be derived from the circulation of this vast sum of money, during this 
period of financial .distress), is of inestimable value. It furnishes the very 
life's blood of our industrial pursuits, and will assist in tiding this section 
of the country over, in some of its financial difficulties. 

Speaking of circulation of the blood reminds me of the fact that 
a dollar as the circulating medium of finance, is to the body of the 
financial world, exactly what a drop of blood is to the human body. 

1 understand there are about twenty pounds of blood in the human 
body, and that the heart handles about four ounces every time it 
beats; therefore it handles, since the heart beats about eighty times 
a minute, the whole twenty pounds every minute. Multiply this 
quantity by sixty, and then multiply it by twenty-four, and you get 
more than ten tons — yet there are only twenty pounds of blood 
which circulate continuously every twenty-four hours. Twenty 
pounds of circulating medium ; ten tons of work every twenty-four 
hours — the heart, just about the size of my hand, is a wonderful little 
pump. It goes, with some people, over ninety years, without even 
being told to go. Of course, it just accidentally dropped inside of us, 
and just accidentally goes on, according to the ideas of some people! 

Now, it is estimated that a dollar does from $25 to $100 worth of 
work every year. Just figure it out — if you can get a string of 
figures long enough — what this $18,000,000 would do, if it did a 
hundred times that much work every year. Brother Ivins had an inter- 
esting check. A man in Arizona, where they have had great money de- 
pression and are hard up on account of the discontinuance of the high 
prices for cotton, drew up a check for $25. When the check was returned 
it had paid $500 in debts, having twenty endorsers. I heard the manager 
of the Federal Reserve bank in our city say that some six or seven 
months ago there were forty odd million dollars of rediscounts in that 
bank, and that they had been reduced to twenty-two and a fraction. I 
want to give it, as my judgment, that as 85 per cent of all the sugar 
that is raised in the intermountain country has to go to or beyond the 
Missouri river, if the vast sum of money, resulting from sugar sales had 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT

not been brought here, instead of the Federal Reserve Bank having only 
twenty odd millions of rediscounts today, it would have nearer thirty 
odd millions. 

I have often told the story about Bishop Geo. E. Farrell, who bought 
some home-made shoes and paid for them at the depot, and then 
found his $5 went around and around and at last landed in his own 
pocket after paying $25 worth of debts. He said he bought home- 
made goods because it kept the money at home and helped build up the 
community. I recommend this, because, since I was a youth of 17 
or 18, I bought but one suit of clothes in Salt Lake.until the mills closed, 
not made from cloth manufactured in the old Provo Woolen Mills. 
I heard Brigham Young deliver a sermon here, telling the people who 
were then a thousand miles from supplies, that we should be self- 
sustaining and should patronize home manufacturing institutions. I 
patronized the Provo Woolen Mills from that day until the day the 
mills closed. The one suit purchased in Salt Lake that was not made 
from Provo goods, was when I had the honor of being in the Legis- 
lature. We gave a ball to the members of the Wyoming legislature. 
I was wearing at that time a gray Provo suit; but did not want to 
be the only white sheep at the ball in the theatre ; so I bought a hand- 
me-down black suit from the Z. C. M. I. — "Prince Albert." The next 
day I gave that thirty odd dollar suit to a poor relative. I said I did 
not want to have it on, if I should happen to want to preach on sup- 
porting home manufacture. • 

" 'Had this financing not been accomplished, business concerns through- 
out this section would have been shaken to their very foundations and 
would have suffered great losses. 

" 'To produce the $18,000,000 resulting from the 160,000 acres of beets 
and the sugar manufactured therefrom, it would take 1,000,000 acres of 
grain or 1,500,000 acres of alfalfa at the present prices. Therefore the 
sugar beet crop manufactured into sugar has produced, in the gross, five or 
six times, at least, as much per acre as that of the other standard crops of 
this section. \t also furnishes thousands of people with employment both 
in and out of the factories, which the other crops do not furnish. 

" 'Besides, the by-products of the beet crop, such as tops, pulp and syrup, 
have fed thousands of head of cattle, sheep and dairy cows, thus produc- 
ing abundance of beef, mutton and dairy products, for home consumption 
and shipment abroad, the returns for which have been brought back to the 
two states above mentioned. Futher, the feeding of the livestock on the 
farms helps to keep up the fertility. It has been thoroughly demonstrated 
that the growing of sugar beets raises the standard of farming and in- 
creases the yields of other crops to follow. The countries of the old world, 
as well as the new, where sugar beets have been grown for a long period 
of years, have proved that where 25 per cent of the land has been used 
for beet culture the remaining 75 per cent has raised as much in cereals as 
the 100 per cent produced before sugar beets were grown. The deep plow- 
ing required for this crop, the intense cultivation of the soil, and the sma'l, 
fine rootlets of the beets, that penetrate deeply into the soil, and are left there 
to pass off into the soil, are all beneficial to other crops in the rotation system 
which so many of the farmers have learned to follow.' " 

This is the end of the quotation from whoever furnished this in-

formation. The associate editor of the Era, Edward H. Anderson, 
than whom no more faithful, no more upright, no more diligent man 
is in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, makes the 
following comment: 

"Both business and agriculture have indeed cause to be thankful that 
the policy pursued in the beginning of the sugar industry in Utah, about 
thirty years ago, is still to be continued." 

After hearing an adverse report to establishing the industry, made 
by a committee of leading financial minds of Utah, President Wilford 
Woodruff said, "The beet sugar industry will be beneficial to this 
community, and although it may break the Church, it shall be estab- 
lished." To the inspiration of the Lord to that man, we are indebted for 
the establishment of this great industry. 

HOME MANUFACTURE 

I am delighted to say that within the last week, I have placed 
an order for a suit of clothes from goods made at the Knight Woolen 
factory. Go thou and do likewise. I am delighted to say that I am 
standing in shoes that are made here at home. Go thou and do like- 
wise. We sing, "We thank thee, O God, for a prophet to guide us 
in these latter days," but many of us ought to put a postscript on it, 
"Provided he doesn't guide us to do something that we do not want 
to do." 

GOVERNMENT AID TO INDUSTRY 

During the past year, on account of the financial distress and 
other troubles, I have had to go to New York and Washington three 
times. I want to say that I am delighted to be a citizen of this great 
Republic. I am delighted that we are a great and powerful nation; 
I am delighted that the men who stand at the head of this nation 
are anxious for the welfare of the farmer, the stock-growers, the 
beet industry and every other industry in our country. I believe that, 
except for the aid extended by the Government of the United States, 
through the War Finance Committee, amounting to about nine mil- 
lion, five hundred thousand dollars, our beet sugar industry could not 
have survived. Bankers from San Francisco, Chicago and New York 
declined to assist when we appealed for aid to harvest our beet crops, 
for some of our factories here. We asked for an adjournment of forty- 
eight hours. The next day a committee of influential men from this 
City and from Denver presented our claims to Mr. Eugene Meyer, Jr., 
the manager of the War Finance Committee, and to his associates. Mr. 
Meyer introduced us to the President of the United States, who very 
kindly said, "These men are entitled to your help." Before the day was 
over we were pledged ten million dollars upon our stock of sugars, 
with which to harvest the beet crop and to furnish the money to pay 
the farmer. That money came to us rapidly. The next day, when we 
went back to New York, where we had been met with a cold reception 
and no promise of help, arrangements were made for a year's exten-

sion upon several millions of obligations of some of the sugar com- 
panies. I am grateful for our wonderful country. 

SERVICES AND LIBERTIES OF OUR GREAT AND GLORIOUS COUNTRY 

Speaking of our wonderful country reminds me that recently 
I heard, three speeches by Herbert Hoover, which are among the most 
remarkable that I have heard in my life. One was given at the 
Commercial Club, one before the Engineer's Association of Utah and 
the third one before the Rotarians. I have just sent a copy of the 
speech before the Rotarians to the Deseret News, to be printed next 
Saturday. I would to the Lord that every American citizen would 
read that speech. I will read the closing paragraph. He had told 
of the feeding of millions upon millions by our great and glorious 
country, and he closed by saying: 

"I feel certain that it is more important to our country both spiritually 
and materially that we should have planted the American flag in the 
hearts of 250,000,000 people, than that we should maintain it at the mast- 
head of any battle-ship we have yet built." 

While I think of it, I am grateful for the success of that won- 
derful Disarmament Conference recently held in Washington, as a 
result of which millions upon millions of dollars of battleships will be 
peaceably sunk, instead of being used as engines of war to kill hosts 
of people and to be sunk in battle ; and that the armaments of the 
great countries have been reduced. 

A FIVE WEEKS' REST AND ACTIVITY IN CALIFORNIA 

I recently had the pleasure of spending a little more than five 
weeks in Southern California. After the strenuous time that I had 
in the East, and the multiplicity of duties that devolve upon me, I 
took my first long rest since I was a boy of fifteen. Nevertheless, 
mail followed me and I kept a stenographer busy most of the time 
while I was resting. In addition I had the pleasure of attending 
meetings in the wonderful city of Los Angeles, which is growing by 
leaps and bounds, in Ocean Park, in San Bernardino, in Fresno, in 
Bakersfield, in Long Beach and in San Diego. I attended nine 
meetings in five weeks. Notwithstanding the "loaf," so to speak, 
that I had down there, I did quite a bit of work. We dedicated a 
meeting-house in San Bernardino, and I feel to rejoice that upon the 
spot of ground that was originally settled by "Mormon" pioneers, we 
now have our own meeting-house. The United States sent an army 
against us because some run-away judges lied and said that we had 
burned the court records and that we were in rebellion, etc., etc. ; 
when these charges were afterwards proved to be false we were 
pardoned for sins that we had not committed. At, that time the 
"Mormon" pioneers in San Bernardino were called home from the great 
California ranch which they had bought and which today, no doubt, 
is worth more than all the possessions of the Church of Jesus Christ

of Latter-day Saints, several times over. The fact is that those who 
remained there and who did not come back when Brigham Young 
called them, lost their faith; and every Latter-day Saint who believes 
and knows that we have the truth, realize that the saving of one soul 
is of greater value than all the wealth of the world. Therefore we 
feel to thank the Lord that about 95 per cent of the San Bernardino 
settlers came back to Utah. I thank the Lord that upon the spot in 
California where once the Latter-day Saints were established, we 
now have our own meeting-house. 

I rejoice thoroughly in the wonderful spirit of the gospel which 
I found in my recent labors in California. There are no people in 
all the wide world that can compare with the Latter-day Saints in 
fulfiling the admonition of our Redeemer to keep the first and 
second great commandents, "Thou shalt love thy God with all 
thy heart, and with all thy soul and with all thy mind" ; and the 
second is like unto it, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." 

WONDERFUL MISSIONARY WORK OF THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS 

When I think of the wonderful missionary work of the Latter- 
day Saints, the five hundred, the thousand, and some years two thous- 
and men at a time who go out at their own expense, with no hope of 
earthly reward, to proclaim an unpopular doctrine, solely because of 
the love of their fellow men, I rejoice in this gospel of Jesus Christ 
that inspires men with a willingness to perform such service. When 
I think of the twenty long years that have been given in proclaiming 
the gospel without money and without price, by my counselor, Presi- 
dent Charles W. Penrose, now 90 years old — twenty long years in 
his native land, ten years as a young man from nineteen to twenty- 
nine, without purse and without scrip — .without hope of earthly re- 
ward, I rejoice in the testimony and the knowledge of the gospel that 
must be in a man's heart who will give such wonderful evidence of 
the love of God and the love of his fellow man. No peoples in all the 
world can compare with the Latter-day Saints in giving of their time 
and their money for the benefit of their fellows, to carry to them the 
glad tidings of great joy. The California mission is growing by 
leaps and bounds as are all of our missions. 

EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES — CHURCH AND SECULAR 

That reminds me that I have a few missionary statistics here in 
connection with some others, that I will now read : 

"There have been expended for the year 1921 for stake and ward 
purposes in the maintenance of operation of the stakes and the wards of 
the Church, $925,270. 

"Education — Expended for the maintenance and operation of Church 
schools and seminaries, $893,000. i 

I will read something about education from a great educator, 
Nicholas Murray Butler, President of the Columbia University. This 
was. sent to me by the President of the Brigham Young College : 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT

"The little red schoolhouse of the generation that followed the Civil 
War, with its wretchedly poor equipment but with an earnest and devoted 
teacher who laid stress upon character-building and upon the fundamentals 
of intellectual training, did more for the American people than does many 
a costly and well-equipped educational palace such as may be seen in any 
part of the United States today. 

"It is significant, too, that in this period of vigorous and able-bodied 
reaction the world should be without a poet, without a philosopher, and 
without a notable religious leader. The great voices of the spirit arte all stilled 
just now. while the mad passion for gain and for power endeavors to 
gratify itself through the odd device of destroying what has already been 
gained or accomplished. 

"The simple business of training young children in good habits of diet 
and exercise and conduct; of teaching them the elementary facts of the 
nature which surrounds them and of the society of which they form a part; 
and of giving them ability to read undcrstandingly, to write legibly and to 
perform quickly and with accuracy the fundamental operations with num- 
bers, has been pushed into the background by all sorts of enterprises that 
have their origin in eimotionalism in ignorance, or in mlere vanity. 

"There is no man, there is no people, without a God. That God may be 
a visible idol, carved of wood, or stone, to which sacrifice is offered in 
the forest,, in the temple, or in the market-place; or it may be an invisible 
idol, fashioned in a man's own image and worshiped ardently at his own 
personal shrine. Somewhere in the universe there is that in which each 
individual has firm faith, and on which he places steady reliance. The fool 
who says in his heart, "There is no God" really means there is no God but 
himself. His supreme egotism, his colossal vanity, have placed him at the 
center of the universe which is thereafter to be measured and dealt with in 
terms of his personal satisfactions. So it has come to pass that after 
nearly two thousand years much of the world resembles the Athens of St. 
Paul's time, in that it is wholly given to idolatry; but in the modern case 
there are as many idols as idol worshipers, and every such idol worshiper 
finds his idol in the looking-glass. The time has come once again to repeat 
and to expound in thundrous tones the noble sermon of St. Paul on Mars 
Hill, and to declare to these modern idolaters "Whom, therefore, ye ignorantly 
worship, Him declare I unto you." 

A gentleman sent out several hundred letters to representative 
ministers, and asked them the question: "Do you believe in God, a 
personal God, a definite and tangible intelligence, not a congeries of 
laws floating like a fog in the universe, but God a person, in whose 
image you were made?" Not a minister answered, "yes." They said 
they could not be certain about a thing of that kind. There is no 
Latter-day Saint who does not believe absolutely in God as a person- 
al being, and that the scripture tells the truth when it says "In the 
image of God created He him; male and female created He them." 
The foundation of the Church of Jesus Christ, organized ninety-two 
years ago today, is based upon the appearance of the Liord, God Al- 
mighty, a glorified Being beyond the power of man to describe, to a 
boy not yet fifteen years of age. It is based upon the 
appearance of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, in the express image 
of the Father, to that boy. In answer to the boy's simple question, 
"Which of all the churches on earth today is the true one," the Lord 
God Almighty pointed to His Son and said to that boy, "This is my 



12 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



beloved Son ; hear Him." When the question was repeated, which 
church to join, that boy was told to> join none of them; that they had 
all gone astray. lie was given to understand that he would be the 
instrument in the hands of God of again establishing upon the earth 
the gospel of Jesus Christ. We declare to all the world that God 
lives, that He is the Father of our spirits, that He is absolutely the 
Father of Jesus Christ, that Jesus Christ is the Redeemer of the world. 
Men say we lack liberality and breadth, because we say we are the 
only true Church. We are not lacking in liberality or breadth ; the Re- 
deemer of the world, Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior, said it, and 
we are repeating what He said. We believe in allowing all men abso- 
lute freedom to worship where and what they may, but we declare to 
all the world the truth as it has been revealed to us through the Proph- 
et Joseph Smith. All men, all women, from the midnight sun country 
of Scandinavia to South Africa, from Canada to South America, or 
upon the Islands of the sea, who have entered the waters of baptism 
and joined the Church of Christ, believe that Joseph Smith was in very 
deed a prophet of the true and living God, and that God is a person 
and talked to the boy Joseph. The whole world may declare they 
do noi believe that Joseph Smith saw God, the whole world may declare 
that they do not believe that Jesus Christ appeared to him or delivered 
a message, but all the disbelief of the world cannot change that message 
and the truth of it, as it was delivered. Joseph Smith declared that 
three years after the First Vision, in answer to. fervent prayer, an an- 
gel of God appeared and delivered a message to him ; that the angel dis- 
appeared and leturned and repeated his message again; that he again 
dissappeared and returned the third time. The entire night was con- 
sumed with the three repetitions of that message which was that 
there were buried, in the Hill Cumorah, some golden plates upon 
which was inscribed the sacred history of the forefathers of the 
American Indians, and that he should be the instrument in the hands 
of God of translating those plates. The plates have been translated and 
the translation is now known as the Book of Mormon. 

"Oh," says one, "I do not believe he ever had the plates." If 
he had the plates, the disbelief of the world cannot change it. Joseph 
Smith announced that John, the Baptist, came to the earth laid his 
hands upon the heads of Oliver Cowdery and Joseph Smith, and or- 
dained them to the Aaronic Priesthood, with authority to baptize; and 
he also announced that Peter, James and John came to the earth and 
delivered the authority to build up the Church of Christ, by laying 
their hands upon them and by ordaining them to the Melchizedek or 
the higher Priesthood and by bestowing upon them the Apostleship. 
So, to all the world we declare these truths, and the disbelief of all 
the world cannot change the fact, for it is a fact. God has given to 
the Latter-day Saints by the revelations of His Spirit a knowledge 
that this is true. Again reading from Prest. Butler's remarks: "We 
are trustees of a great inheritance. If we abuse or neglect that trust, 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 13 

we are responsible before Almighty God for the infinite damage that 
will be done in the lives of individuals and of nations." 

I will have this extract from the speech of Nicholas Murray 
Butler, part of which I have read, published in full in the Era. 1 1 think 
you will all enjoy reading it. 

I rejoice in the very splendid exercises that we had yesterday up 
at the University. You will undoubtedly be able to read the speeches 
that were made. I thoroughly enjoyed them, and I am sure you will. 

There has been expended for educational purposes $893,000. 

This is over 100 per cent, nearly 150 per cent more than it was 
a few years ago. I regret, because of the falling off in tithing, the 
discontinuance of dividends from sugar companies and other ins- 
titutions, that we will have to curtail very materially during the com- 
ing year, our school activities. 

CHURCH CHARITIES AND MISSION EXPENDITURES 

Expenditures for Temples : — Expended for the construction, maintenance 
and operations of temples, $170,000. 

Charities : — Amount expended from the tithes, $266,649. 

There was expended for charities through the Relief Socities and other 
sources, $459,769, therefore the total expenditures for Church charities last year 
was $726,733. 

You wi'l notice that the total expenditures not including the Relief Society 
disbursements, amount to $2,255,234, which is for stake and ward purposes, 
education, temples and charities. 

Mission Expenditures 

For the erection of chapels and the maintenance and operation of all the 
missions $518,647. In additions to the payments made from Church funds for 
mission purposes, we estimate there has been sent to missionaries by their 
families and friends, $860,640. 

By the way, we have heard it remarked by some people, that 
they had quit paying tithing because all the tithing comes to Salt Lake 
City, and that they would like to build up their own local section. 
For the benefit of the Saints, I will announce that 84 2-3 per cent of 
all the tithes collected, in the missions and in the Church, is sent back 
to the stakes, wards and missions. So the immense amount that is 
used up here won't hurt anybody very much. 

CHURCH GROWTH AND VITAL STATISTICS 

Children blessed and entered on the records of the Church in the stakes and 



missions 20,441. 

Children baptized in the stakes and missions 15,404. 

Converts entered on the records of the Church by baptism 7,113 

Net increase in Church membership for the year 1921 22,779 



There are now 86 stakes of Zion, 879 wards, 24 missions and 789 branches in 
the missions. 

Birth rate, 37.3 per thousand. 
Death rate, 8.2 per thousand. 

Families owning their own hemes, 75 per cent.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



VITAL STATISTICS 

We are a very wicked and bad people, according to liars over in 
England and some other places, even in this country. As a rule no 
bad people have a high birth rate. No civilized people, who are bad, 
have a low death rate. No bad people have a low proportion of the 
inmates of the penitentiary. The Ex-Governor of Arizona was reputed 
to have said — I did not hear him say it, but George Albert Smith and 
Joseph F. Smith say they did; that no better citizens could be found 
in Arizona than the "Mormons." In one particular, considering the 
expenditure of the state taxes, he said they were being robbed of be- 
tween 2500 and 3000 per cent, because in proportion to their popula- 
tion they ought to have in the Arizona State Penitentiary from twen- 
ty-five to thirty inmates and they only had one. He said that in anoth- 
er respect they were being robbed, also, for they ought to have seven 
or eight in the Insane Asylum, and did not have any. The first 
time I went to Arizona, after I heard this story, I was speaking in 
the St. Johns meeting house, and when I expressed my gratitude that 
we were lacking twenty-four to twenty-nine inmates in the state peni- 
tentiary, a gentleman got up and said that he was the District Judge 
in Apache county and that the one "Mormon" inmate of the peni- 
tentiary had been pardoned. When Governor Campbell was here 
with the Governors of the states of the Union, he and some others 
did us the honor to call upon my counselors and myself, and I re- 
peated this story to the Governor. ' He laughed and said, "Yes, I 
remember, he was from Apache county." 

I have been connected, since the time I was a boy of fif- 
teen — fifty long years — with the insurance business. The death rate 
in the great life insurance companies, like the Mutual Life and the New 
York Life, that I also represented, (neither of whom would insure me, 
because I was too long and lean, and they had a rule you know, that 
a man has to be somewhere within the bounds of proportion before 
he is fit to be insured) is ten and a fraction to the thousand, yet 
this bad, immoral people that are sending out missionaries to secure 
girls practically for brothels and houses of ill-fame, according to the 
liars in England, whose lies have caused mobs to break all of the win- 
dows in our London meeting house and to have the Government it- 
self consider the question whether they will let a "Mormon" preach 
in that fair land ; this people has a death rate nearly 20 per cent lower 
than the great life insurance companies. "By their fruits ye shall 
know them." I am at the defiance of the world to prove that there 
can be found in any land or in any clime a community that by their 
fruits of honesty, of integrity, of virtue, of sobriety, of all these things 
that go to make a good community — can show anything better by 
their vital statistics than can the Latter-day Saints. I rejoice indeed, 
my brethren and sisters, in the knowledge that we have that we are 
serving God and that we are keeping His commandments and that 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 15 



sooner or later those who know not the Truth, if they will investi- 
gate our message and will investigate the record we have made, will 
have to put the stamp of honesty, of sobriety, of integrity, of love of 
fellow-men and of love of God and the love of country upon the 
Latter-day Saints.

DEATH OF WM. W. RITER 

We have lost by death the chairman of our auditing committee, 
William W. Riter, the Chairman of the Board of Regents of the 
University, a pioneer, one of the stalwart, faithful, diligent men of 
our Church. The last time I heard him preach, he delivered a ser- 
mon, which I sincerely regret was not reported. He announced that 
for some fifteen or twenty years, as I remember it, he had religiously, 
once a year, read the Book of Mormon through ; and he said, to his 
mind, it contained more inspiring and uplifting doctrine than any 
book that had ever been published. He said he was at the defiance 
of any man to find anything in the Book of Mormon, from cover to 
cover, to offend ; that everything taught was uplifting to man- 
kind. He stated that he loved the contents of that book with all his 
heart. He bore a wonderful testimony of the divinity of this work; 
and of his intimate acquaintance and knowedge of the integrity 
of the men, from Brigham Young down to the present time who had 
stood at the head of the Church. He was only a boy when the Prophet 
Joseph Smith was martyred, but he knew him; he came here as a 



16

boy; he was one of the stalwarts of the business world in Utah. We 
mourn his loss. 

RETURN OF ELDER DAVID O. MCKAY FROM CIRCLING THE GLOBE 

I rejoice in this wonderful gathering. I rejoice in the knowledge 
which I possess that we are engaged in the work of the living God. 
I rejoice in the fact that Brother McKay is with us today. Brother 
McKay has circled the globe since he was last at a conference — has 
visited our missions in nearly every part of the world, and has re- 
turned, as every missionary does return who goes out to proclaim 
this gospel and comes in contact with the people of the world and 
with all the varieties of faiths of the world, with increased light, 
knowledge and testimony regarding the divinity of the work in which 
we are engaged. 

THANKFULLNESS AND CAUSES FOR REJOICING 

I thank God for the knowledge that I have that He lives. I 
thank God for the knowledge I have that Jesus Christ is thd Reedenier 
of the world. I thank God for the knowledge that I possess that 
Joseph Smith was a prophet of the true and the living God, and that 
this gospel, commonly called "Mormonism" is in very deed the plan 
of life and salvation. I thank the Lord that I know that the souls of 
men are precious in the sight of God, and that no other 
people upon all the earth are so ready, so willing, so anx- 
ious, as the Latter-day Saints are, to proclaim and spread the 
gospel so that those who embrace it may go back and dwell eternally in 
the presence of God, our heavenly Father. We, as a people, have cause 
to rejoice because of the rich outpouring of the Spirit of the living God 
upon the people all over the wide world, who have embraced the re- 
stored gospel. I do pray with all the power, with all the fervor ol 
my soul, that every Latter-day Saint who knows that God lives, who 
knows that Jesus Christ is our Redeemer, who knows that Joseph 
Smith was a prophet, may live the gospel, may proclaim it by their 
works of honesty, of integrity, of devotion, of a prayerful, upright 
life, that those who, know not the truth, by our example and our works 
may be led to investigate the message that we have to bear. This is 
my prayer and I ask it in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

A sacred solo, music by Evan Stephens, was sung by Jessie Evans, 
entitled "Be with me, Lord." 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

We are honored with the presence this morning of Professor 
Thomas Nixon Carver, of Harvard University, President Walter 
Ernest Clark, of the University of Nevada, and President Charles A. 
Lory, of the Colorado Agricultural College. I am sure we will be 
delighted to hear a few words from these gentlemen. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT

THOMAS NIXON CARVER 

{Of Harvard University) 

I never expected to have such an honor as this in my life. I have 
been in this community a number of times and I have frequently thought 
that here was the best place in the world to study the science and the 
art of nation-building in the field. My subject is Political Economy, 
sometimes called the science of statesmanship. Some things pertain- 
ing to this subject we can get out of books, but it seems to me that here 
is the one place in the world where we can see in operation, in the field 
itself, the processes going on under which a great nation is built. If 
"By their fruits ye shall know them," as your President has said, the 
"Mormons" must be a great people, for their fruits are good. I have 
not only been impressed, in several visits, by what is to be seen in 
this immediate neighborhood. It has also been my privilege to visit 
some of the smaller communities in the southern part of the state and 
some in central Idaho ; and in the small communities, as well as in the 
large, I have seen in operation the snence and the art of community- 
building, which is nation-building in miniature, and everywhere it has 
my unbounded admiration. 

I did not know what I was going to say when I got up. I have 
often had this in my mind, and I am very glad, now that it is over with, 
that I have had the opportunity of saying it. Though I was very much 
scared at first, I am very glad that I have had the privilege of saying 
what I have often thought. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

President Clark of the University of Nevada, our next door 
neighbor. We like to be on good terms with our neighbors; that is 
good citizenship. 

WALTER E. CLARK 

(President of the University of Nevada) 

The world has made much advance in mechanical things, during 
our recorded race history. It has made relatively small 'advance 
in spiritual, things. Your fathers in a marvelous pioneer pilgrimage 
came into this valley, and with their hands builded here a perfect temple, 
that the souls might open in this temple towards the spiritual power, 
and, perhaps, in larger and larger measure, be imbued with 
that power from above. It is my belief and strong hope that in the 
years just ahead men are going to illuminate life in spiritual terms; 
that just as they have, within these twenty-five years, on the mechan- 
ical side, touched that marvelous thing we call radium and learned that 
it gives fifty million times the energy of other substances science has 



18 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



been handling, so there lies within us, if we will but open our souls and 
receive the endowment that freely has always been offered, many, many, 
many times the spirit power men have known. My impress from the 
hours I have had in your city is that this people are holding their souls 
open, and the great Giver of life and power will answer their prayers. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

President Charles A. Lory, of the Agricultural College of the State 
of Colorado, our neighbor to the East. 

CHARLES A. LORY 

(President of the Agricultural College of Colorado) 

Friends and neighbors of Utah, this is not the first time I have had 
the privilege of being in this wonderful Tabernacle of yours, but it is 
the first time I have ever had the honor and privilege of speaking to so 
many of you at this place. We were entertained here in a splendid way 
when the Rotarians were here about three years ago ; and all the memo- 
ries we have of you people, of your Church, of your Tabrnacle, of this 
wonderful city, are altogether good and on the positive side. Those of 
us who are charged with the work of education and with the work of 
building forward our civilization, cannot help but admire the work that 
you are doing. As a young man, it was my privilege, first, to get 
acquainted with folks like you in Northern Wyoming ; and as a young 
man, I must confess that I carried all the prejudice of certain young 
men regarding you and your beliefs. In all fairness I must say that 
those prejudices were altogether wrong, that I found you altogether 
different, and so far as my experience goes with the pioneer "Mormon" 
citizens of northern Wyoming, altogether good. In all fairness, also, 
I must confess that the training I there got has helped me, as much as 
any course I ever took, in trying to carry out my duties as an educator 
in your neighboring State to the East. No one can be here at a gather- 
ing like this without being impressed with the wonder of what it means, 
to every community here represented. 

I listened with interest to President Grant's statement about 
your sugar industry. We also have a sugar industry, but, President 
Grant, ours was not as fortunate as yours, because I am afraid our 
farmers are going to lose heavily throueh the loss of one of their inde- 
pendent companies. I have listened to the report of the development of 
your work and of your members, and certainly everyone here has cause 
to be gratified for the progress that you are making. 

We are privileged to work with the "Mormon" settlers in Southern 
and Southwes'ern Colorado. We know their worth and we always go 
to those sections with a great deal of r nthusiasm, because we know what 
is being done. I feel that the time is here when, as President Clark has 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



19 



said, we must build spirituality. The curve that represents the growth 
of spirituality is rather a flat one ; the curve that represents the increase 
in wealth, the increase in material knowledge, is rather a 
steep one; and, somehow, we must learn to do as you are 
doing; carry our religion into our day's work — not religion on one 
day only, but religion on seven days, and every hour of the twenty- 
four. I count it a privilege to add my testimony to the work that you 
are doing. I count it a privilege that I am permitted, as a laborer in 
the vineyard, to carry forward the work of education. I count it a priv- 
ilege to tell you that your people in Colorado are doing their 
part well. They are good neighbors and they are helping us in a work 
that we count highly important, a piece of work that you are doing 
and doing well in Utah, namely, supplanting the "little red school 
house" by a better school house, usually a consolidated school, where 
better opportunities can be given to the country children, 'a work that 
has placed, in (he last ten years, something like thirty-six thousand 
children in consolidated schools and brought high school facilities to 
something like six thousand children who had no such school facilities 
before; and best of all, a work that is resulting in the formation of a 
community church where men and women of many different sects and 
faiths could gather in one place under one organization, to worship 
God. May your work prosper. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

These gentlemen have another appointment. We will pardon them 
if they say goodby. We are very grateful for the very spledid com- 
plimentary things they have said of us, and we hope that we will have 
the pleasure of welcoming them back here at no far distant date ; and 
certainly I hope that I may, some day, have the privilege of meeting 
these people in their own homes. 

ELDER JOHN M. KNIGHT 

(President of the Western States Mission.) 

One of our distinguished educators stated that he was frightened. 
I said to my co-laborers that at this conference I would be ready for 
almost anything that might happen, because I had a similar experience 
to this one at the October conference, last year. 

I feel very keenly my weakness in occupying this position this 
morning. However, I rejoice in the privilege of being present with 
you and listening to the opening address of our President. It was 
just what we need. Recently in our mission, the Western States, we 
have been told that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 
was a great commercial institution, engaged in big business enterprises 
to the exclusion of spiritual matters. You know that is not true. A 
gentleman in Denver, whom the papers said was an authority on the 



20 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



"Mormon" question stated recently that all of the tithing of the Church 
had been hoarded until it controlled four hundred millions of dollars, 
and that is was able to shake Wall Stret to the very center (laughter). 
You know how true that is. 

I am very glad President Grant made the statement he did with 
reference to the beet sugar industry, and' the part played by the 
Church in extending its credit, to assist this worthy enterprise during 
the recent financial troubles. We hear of it in our neighboring states 
to the east of us, Wyoming, in Colorado, in Nebraska, and in South 
Dakota. Some of our good friends are opposed to the Church be- 
cause of its activity in these enterprises ; but I am grateful to belong 
to an organization that looks after the temporal as Well as the spiritual 
interests of its members. 

I am very grateful also for the testimony that has been borne 
by the President of the Church that the Latter-day Saints are wor- 
shiping God, and that they have an abiding faith in the divine mis- 
sion of Jesus Christ ; that they believe him to be the very Son of the 
living God. We have many in our field of labor who deny these 
things. Some of them are making the statement that Christ, the Son 
of God, never claimed divinity for himself, that in everv sense of the 
word he was man, with a human mind, with human intellect, and with 
human will ; and when one quotes to them from the gospel of St. 
John, where he declared Himself to be the Messiah, the Redeemer 
of the world, thev will tell you it cannot be accepted because it is not 
well authenticated history, and is not corroborated by the synoptic 
gospels, Matthew, Mark and Luke. I am thankful for the faith that 
has come into the lives of the Latter-day Saints, who have the witness 
of the Spirit that these things are true, that the Redeemer of the world 
did make a supreme sacrifice on Calvary for the salvation of the hu- 
man family, and that He is, in every sense! of the word, the Son of th« 
living God ; that He was more than philosopher, more than a teacher 
of great moral truths, that He was what He professed to be: the Son 
of the living God, the Redeemer of the world. We know that His 
is the only name given under heaven by and through which salvation 
can come to the children of men. 

I have often wondered whv these men. these learned men, many 
of them professed ministers of the gospel, deny the oower there is in 
the gospel and deny the sonship of the Redeemer. I am convinced it 
is because they have not the witness of the Holv Spirit. The Savior 
said. "If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true. There is 
another that beareth witness of me ; and I know that the witness which 
He witnesseth of me is true. Ye sent unto John and He bare witness 
of the truth. * * * But I have greater witness than that of John ; for 
the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works 
that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me. And 
the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me." 



ELDER JOHN M. KNIGHT

We know this witness is true, through the power of the Holy Ghost. 
Remember the words of the Apostle Paul, writing to the Corinthian 
Saints (1 Cor. 12:) "Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I 
would not have you ignorant. * * * Wherefore I give you to under- 
stand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus ac- 
cursed : and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the 
Holy Ghost." The w,orld is without this witness, they deny the 
power by which they may know these things. That is what was said 
to the Prophet Joseph Smith by the Redeemer on the occasion of the 
first great vision and revelation in this dispensation : the creeds of 
men have a form of godliness but deny the power thereof. The 
Savior said to his disciples: "If ye love me, keep my commandments. 
And I will pray the Father, and He shall give you another Comforter, 
that he may abide with you forever ; even the Spirit of truth, whom 
(he world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth 
him ; but ye know him ; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in 
you." 

Who are the world? I answer they who have not put on Christ 
by baptism. Call to mind the statement that was made by the Apostle 
Peter when he appeared before the chief priests who had thrown him 
into prison for speaking unto the people "all the words of this life," 
healing their sick, and adding multitudes to the Church. In answer 
to their question: "Did not we straightly command you that ye should 
not teach in this name? and, behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with 
your doctrine, and intend to bring this man's blood upon us. Then 
Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We 1 ought to obey God 
rather than men. The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye 
slew and hanged on a tree. Him hath God exalted with His right hand 
to be a Prince and a Savior, for to give repentance to Israel, and 
forgiveness of sins. 

"And we are his witnesses of these things ; and so is also the Holy 
Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey Him." 

I thank the Lord that this witness has come into the lives of the 
Latter-day Saints, and that we are not as the world. We have come 
out of the world, and the Lord has blessed us with a testimony of the 
truth ; the greatest gift of God to man. 

May God add his blessings, that we may have a time of rejoic- 
ing in all the sessions of this conference, that we may go from here 
with a full determination to more perfectly serve God and keep His 
commandmen' s, I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang, "Do what is right, the day- 
dawn is breaking." 

Benediction was pronounced by Elder Heber C. Austin, President 
of the Bingham stake of Zion. 

Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



AFTERNOON SESSION 

At 2 o'clock President Heber J. Grant opened the meeting by 
announcing that the choir and congregation would sing, "Guide us, U 
Thou great Jehovah." 

After singing, prayer was offered by Elder Frank Y. Taylor, 
President of the Granite stake of Zion. 

The choir and congregation then sang the hymn, "High on the 
mountain top." 

PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE 

I feel very thankful today for the many blessings bestowed upon 
me. In the first place I thank the Lord for preserving my lite and 
giving me the opportunity of gathering with the Saints in this confer- 
erence, especially that I had the pleasure and privilege of listening to 
the discourse delivered by the President of the Church — so timely 
and with so much fervor and strength of body and of spirit. I rejoice 
in the progress that President Grant has made since he was chosen and 
set apart as the President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints. 

I am thankful to a large number of my friends, whom I have not 
had the privilege of communicating with since the celebration of my 
ninetieth birth-day, when so large a gathering met in this house and 
paid me so many gracious compliments, and for the letters of congratu- 
lation that I have received from all points of the compass, from differ- 
ent lands, from friends — I won't say foes — but persons not connected 
with the Church, many of them to my great surprise and all to my 
satisfaction, and I take this public opportunity of returning thanks to 
those who have conimunicated with me on this matter. 

The Lord has been good to me all my days and especially since 
he opened the eyes of my understanding so^ that I was able to see 
the truth and the beauty of his great latter-day work — a blessing that 
does not now come to all people. It will, I presume, in the eternities 
that lie before us, when the time comes that every knee will bow and 
every tongue confess that Jesus of Nazareth is the Christ, the Son of 
the living God, and that willingly and freely of their own choice and 
to the glory of our heavenly Father. 

THE ELEMENTS ETERNAL 

The light of the Lord shines always, even in the darkness, although 
the darkness comprehendeth it not, but there is a light that proceeds 
from the presence of the Son of Righteousness and goes throubout all the 
immensity of space. Of course it cannot "fill" space, because space 
cannot be filled, as there is no outside to it, but throuhgout "the im- 
mensity of space," the Lord has revealed, that this light that com*eth 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE 23 



from Him, which is "in all things and through all things, and round 
about all things and is the law by which all things are governed," and 
by which he created all things, both spiritual and temporal, using the 
word temporal after the manner of our speech, for all things are eternal 
to Him and therefore spiritual is not always in force. 

Everything that is organized, of course had a beginning, and so, in 
the nature of things, its beginning was when it was organized, but the 
beginning of all substance is nowhere and is not. The elements of 
all things spiritual and physical, are eternal in their nature and our 
bodies which had a beginning when they were organized, when they 
were born into this world, as far as the body is concerned, had a begin- 
ning ; but, according to the word of the Lord, the essence or substance, 
whether we call it spiritual or physical, is eternal in its nature, as are 1 
light and truth and power and justice; all those eternal verities had 
no beginning and certainly will never have an end, but they come to 
beings when they are ready to receive them, according to their organiza- 
tion. Jesus of Nazareth tells us in his own words that he was "in the 
beginning with the Father," not as Jesus of Nazareth, not as the Son of 
the Virgin Mary, but as the First-born of every creature, as he is named 
by his ancient Apostles. He was in the beginning with the Father, 
was "the First-born," and we also, He says, "were in the beginning with 
the Father ; that which is spirit," that part of us which is spirit, wjas in 
the beginnning with God. We had our beginning as persons, as indi- 
viduals, as the sons and daughters of God, when we were organized 
or created or begotten, whichever term you like to use. 

WE SHOULD NOT GO BEYOND WHAT THE LORD HAS REVEALED 

Now, all these things ought to be very plain to us from what we 
have learned by revelation from God, and we need not try to go further 
back than the period spoken of in the revelations of God, and speculate 
about ourselves and our fellows. We are living in a time, in our 
Church, of a great deal of speculation, of imagination, of desire to go 
beyond what the Lord has revealed, both as to that which precedes 
our present state and that which is to follow us in our future condition, 
but the Lord stands in our midst, and he is our Father, he is the God 
that we worship. The very first article of our faith, as made known and 
arranged by the Prophet Joseph Smith, is that : 

"We believe in God, the Eternal Father, and in his Son, Jesus 
Christ, and in the Holy Ghost." This is a simple statement of the per- 
sons in whom we believe and whom we revere as we are commanded to 
do. God' our eternal Father is the Father of Jesus Christ and is the 
Father of Adam, or rather Michael, the name of that person before he 
came in the flesh. There is nothing new in what I am saying; it is 
all very old to me, and to members of the Church who have investigated 
the latter-day work from the revelations of God. Now, this ought 
to be clear to all our minds, and yet, among some of the classes 
in the Priesthood and in our Sunday school classes, and other organiza- 



24 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



tions, some disputes arise. There shouldn't be any; there is no need 
for it. I would not try to limit the thoughts of men, nor their progress 
in understanding the things of God and the things of man. 
I believe in eternal progression, but when the Lord has revelaed 
something very plain and simple to us, we should take that for granted 
and let that be sufficient for us until he reveals something further. 

WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF THE DAY OF REVELATION 

I do not mean to say that the day of revelation is past- We are in the 
midst of it ; we have the spirit of revelation in the Church. It was by 
that spirit that we heard that splendid discourse this morning, by 
which it was spoken and by which we understood it. I hope 
all of us did understand. I hope that all who are here 
this afternoon were hire this morning and heard that dis- 
course, and if not, I hope that when it is published they will all read 
it and understand it. Jesus taught that lesson, you know, when' he was 
on the earth. "Whoso readeth let him understand," and we Latter-day 
Saints should all understand the things of God alike as he has revealed 
them. We may not have the same degree of light upon these matters, 
but we should have the same light and come to the same understanding 
in all things that are essential ; and one of the essentials of our faith 
is that we believe in God, the eternal Father, and it is He whom we 
worship; it is to Him that we pay deference and reverence, and all 
revelation, whether it comes through Jesus Christ or from any of the 
prophets of God, comes from Him. Sometimes men are endowed with 
authority to use His name and speak for Him, and Jesus Christ is one 
of them, He is "The Word." 

GOD THE ETERNAL FATHER OVER ALL 

President Grant quoted this morning the word of the Father to the 
Prophet Joseph, in the grove, when he prayed to God that he might 
learn which was the true religion. The Father, turning, said, "This 
is my beloved Son, hear Him." That is the word of God to all the 
world and was so from the beginning; the word comes through the 
Son, sometimes from Him through living prophets, sometimes by the 
mouths of angels, and when it comes in that way, authority is bestowed 
to use the sacred name of the Savior and of the Eternal Father. One 
of the ancient prophets whose writings are in the New Testament, said, 
"If any man cometh unto God, he must believe that he is, and that he is 
a revvarder of those who diligently seek him." That is quite an 
important point. He is a being, a personality, an individual, as we were 
told this morning, and He made man in His own image, and likeness 
That is very clear and plain to us if we will take it as it stands. We 
are in the image and likeness of God the Father, and Jesus Christ 
was His express image and likeness, the brightness of His glory and 
the express image of His person. Sometimes, in any family, there is one 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE 



25 



person in the express image of the father or the mother. The relation- 
ship between him and the first parent on earth, the father of our bodies 
— Adam is our father — can be read in the 107th section of the Doctrine 
and Covenants. We are told there that a few years before his death, 
Adam gathered together his posterity, who were in the faith, (some of 
them went out of the faith) but all those who were in the Lord and 
were high priests, met in the Valley of Adam-ondi-Ahman, and Adam 
arose in the midst of the congregation and blessed his children and 
predicted what would befall them to their latest generations, and the 
Lord appeared and He blessed Adam and said, "See, I have placed 
thee at the head ; a multitude of nations shall come of thee, and thou 
art a prince over them forever." And they called him Michael, the 
prince, the archangel. That was his station before he came here. When 
he came here as Adam, he was the son of God, and God was over him 
and he, Adam, prayed to the Eternal Father as we do. I merely 
mention that because there are some disputes in regard to the person- 
ality of Adam before he came into the body. The Lord said he was 
Michael, the archangel, and He, the Father, set him here at the head of 
His race to which we belong. He is "our father, Adam," and as Adam's 
body was of the dust of the earth, this earth on which we live, it had to 
return to dust because of his transgression. 

THE REDEEMER'S NAME IS JESUS CHRIST 

Now, in regard to the second individual spoken of in the first 
article as the Son of God, Jesus Christ. Some of us have adopted the 
habit of saying "the Christ , "He is all th at, but He is named Jesus Christ ; 
that is His name. In the 18th Section of the Doctrine and Covenants, 
the Savior there, Himself reveals to us that His name, the name that 
was given to Him of the Father, is Jesus Christ. He is the anointed ; 
He is the Redeemer; He is the Savior ; but His name is Jesus Christ ; and 
when you say "in the name of Jesus" you only use half of His name. 
Now just understand that wc are commanded of the Lord, Jesus Christ, 
(o do all things in His name and that is the name given Him of the 
Father and "the only name under heaven whereby man can be saved." 

This is what we preach to all the world, go out in our missions 
to preach to all the world, that Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of the Virgin 
Mary, was the Son of God in the flesh and that he was also the Son 
of God, the First-born in the spirit, and his name is to be preached and 
the name is Jesus Christ. A great many of us, when we pray and are a 
little careless, say, "In the name of Jesus. Amen." You often hear it at 
the table when you sit down and hear a blessing pronounced upon the 
food ; it has come to be quite common. I merely refer to this, which 
you may think is a very small matter, but a great deal of importance 
is attached to it by Jesus Christ, Himself, and you will find all through 
the first revelations given to the Church, He says, "Listen to the voice 



26 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



of Jesus Christ, the great I Am, whose arm of mercy has atoned for 
your sins," etc. 

WE ARE TO PERFORM ALL ORDINANCES IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST 

When we baptize, we are to do it in the name of Jesus Christ, 
by his authority ; and when we ask a blessing on the bread or the water, 
in the sacrament of the Lord's supper, we are to use the name Jesus 
Christ; and when we ordain persons to some office in the Priesthood, 
they are to be ordained in the name of Jesus Christ ; we do it by His 
authority, for He is at the head, and the word of the Lord God of hosts 
is to all the world, "Hear Him." "This is my beloved Son, hear Him." 
If all the world today were in the humor and willing to hear Him, He 
could speak the word which would settle all their difficult problems ; 
He would bring the nations together ; He would do away with war and 
conflict of all kind's ; He would establish peace, for He is the prince 
of peace, and His rule will be the rule of peace, and the time will come 
when He will ride, as the prophet said, "From the river to the ends of 
the earth." 

THE WORD OF THE FATHER TO US IS TO HEAR HIS SON JESUS CHRIST 

So, hear it, O ye Latter-day Saints, the Word of the Father to you 
is, "Hear Him, the Son." Take the revelations which He has given 
to the Church ; a great many of them are bound up in the book called 
the Doctrine and Covenants, a new edition of which has been issued, 
and has made a very fine arrangement of those revelations, and I would 
that everybody would study it, get acquainted with the things that God 
has revealed, and they have all come through Jesus Christ. He is our 
living head and all of our prophets and apostles and others who have 
authority in the Church are under His direction, and under His authority 
they act and preach and labor. Lie has said to us as He did to the early 
apostles, "Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every 
creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved, and he that 
believeth not shall be damned." He has repeated that authority in these 
times and this authority rests upon all the elders of this Church who 
are called to be ministers of Jesus Christ. They are to do all things 
in His name, and His blessing will attend what you do. I want to say 
to you that there is virtue in that name ; the evil powers tremble at the! 
sound thereof ; they stand rebuked when it is used by proper authority 
and they flee from it. "In my name shall ye cast out devils ; ye shall 
speak with new tongues ; ye shall take up serpents ; and if ye drink 
any deadly thing it shall not hurt you ; ye shall lay hands on the sick 
and they shall recover." It is all to be done in the name of Jesus 
Christ, the Redeemer, the Son of the living God in spirit and in bodv. 

Brother Knight bore testimony concerning Jesus, in this regard, 
this morning, and I echo it and say amen to it. I have been engaged 
in preaching His name for a great many years, and during all that time I 



PRESIDENT CHARLES IV. PENROSE 27 



found that name to have power in it, power in it for good, power in it 
to rebuke evil, power to overcome darkness and to spread light, and it 
carries the spirit of health and life and light and is the name given under 
heaven, and the only one, whereby man can be saved. Do not forget it, 
brethren ; but use it with prudence and with faith and with reverence. 
Men use it sometimes by way of cursing, but they have no right to do 
so, and it is a wrong thing to do ; but because they misuse it, there is 
no reason why we should drop it. 

THE GOSPEL TO BE PREACHED TO EVERY CREATURE 

The gospel of Jesus Christ is to be preached to every creature. 
Those who do not hear it in the flesh will at some period or other hear 
it in the spirit world; some at one time and some at another; and we 
have learned, by the ordinances revealed in the latter-days, we who have 
been baptized unto Christ, believing in Him and His commandments, that 
we are privileged to stand as proxies for others who have passed away 
without hearing it and some who have heard it, through the corrup- 
tions of men and their own weakness, have not received it. This 
is a grand and glorious work that is being performed in the temples 
that have been reared in behalf of our departed ancestors and some 
"perhaps to whom we are not directly related. 

TOUCHING THE FULLNESS OF THE GOSPEL 

Now, some of our brethren have taken up quite a discussion as to 
the fidness of the everlasting gospel. We are told that the Book of 
Mormon contains the fulness of the gospel, that those who like to get 
i*p a dispute, say that the Book of Mormon does not contain any refer- 
ence to the work of salvation for the dead, and there are many other 
things pertaining to the gospel that are not developed in that book, 
and yet we are told that book contains "the fulness of the everlasting 
gospel." Well, what is the fulness of the gospel? You read care- 
fully the revelation in regard to the three glories, section 76, in the 
Doctrine and Covenants, and you find there defined what the gospel 
is. There God, the Eternal Father, and Jesus Christ, His Son, and the 
Holy Ghost, are held up as the three persons in the Trinity — the one 
God. the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost, all three being united 
and being one God. When people believe in that doctrine and obey 
the ordinances which are spoken of in the same list of principles, you 
get the fulness of the gospel for this reason: If you really believe 
so as to have faith in our Eternal Father and in his Son, Jesus Christ, 
the Redeemer, and will hear Him, you will learn all about what is 
needed to be done for the salvation of the living and the redemption of 
the dead. 

WTien people believe and repent and are baptized by Divine au- 
thority and the Holy Ghost is conferred upon them as a gift, they receive 
the everlasting gospel. We used to call it, and it is now called in the 



28 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



revelations, the "Gift of the Holy Ghost," the Holy Ghost, the spirit 
that proceeds from the presence of the Father throughout the immensity 
of space, which guides, directs, enlightens, which is light in and of itself, 
which is the spirit of intelligence, "the light of truth," and when the 
Holy Ghost as a gift is conferred' upon people, young or old, as an 
"abiding witness," as a continuous gift, as a revelating spirit, they have 
the beginning, and I would not say the end, but they have the substance 
of the gospel of Jesus Christ. They have that which will bring salva- 
tion, for the gift of the Holy Ghost is such that it will highly enlighten 
everyone who receives it. That is the spirit that enlightens every man 
that comes into the world, we are told. Certainly, it is the spirit of life 
and of light, but when it is conferred by the laying on of hands, as a 
gift to the individual, a special gift, above that natural light that comes 
bv birth, then there is something given to the individual by which he or 
she can inquire and learn and be inspired of God. The Holy Ghost 
is the Spirit of inspiration which comes from the presence of the 
Father and the Son ; it enlightens in regard to all things. "God has 
revealed these things unto us by his Spirit," said' the ancient Apostle 
Peter, "For the spirit searcheth all things, yea the deep things of God," 
and if a man holds the authority of the holy Priesthood, he has to speak 
and preach and administer under the influence of that spirit to make it 
divine. All revelation from the Father comes through the Son, and by 
the power and gift of the Holy Ghost, who, as one of the Trinity, is an 
individual, as we are told in the revelation, he is "a personage of spirit." 

Now some of our brethren get these two ideas confounded no mat- 
ter what is done or said or printed or written. It has been explained 
time and time agam, and vet some of our brethren want to know if everv 
child receives the Holy Ghost as a personage of spirit, when confirmed 
into the Church. No, that is not the idea at all ; the Holy Spirit 
or Holy Ghost (the two terms are used svnonymously very often — 
sometimes perhaps unnecessarilv so) the Holy Ghost which pervades 
all tlrngs, bv which God said he created all things, the Holy Ghost 
which is the Spirit that comes from His presence, this power is dissemi- 
nated through all the worlds ; by that means God enlightens just like the 
ligh f that comes from the sun ; each person does not receive the sun as 
an oreanized body but the light of the sun proceeds forth and illuminates 
different parts of space, to a certan extent, at any rate. 

RECEIVING THE HOLY GHOST 

Now, let us understand this clearly in our own minds : When 
we lay hands upon an individual and say, "Receive the Holy Ghost," 
or "Receive ye the gift of the Holy Ghost," what is it? Do you mean 
to say that upon every child that is confirmed, you give the personality 
of the Holv Ghost, as a personage of spirit? Not at all; it is the 
universal Spirit in a higher degree that is conferred. That Spirit is in 
all things and through all things and round about all things, "the law by 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE 29 



which all things are governed," and by which God controls and regulates 
the universe. It is a gift from God to be with the individual always. 
If he or she will yield to its inspiration, walk in its light, it wilt lead 
right up to the presence of the Father. It comes from Him; it leads to 
Him. I know it to be a reality, as I know that I live. Before I ever 
came here or received the blessings of the House of the Lord, I know 
that I had the gift of the Holy Ghost, in my faith, in my preaching, 
in my ministry, in attending to the ordinances that I administered in the 
name of the Lord- I know that the Spirit and power of God was there. 
I know that when I have been placed in difficult circumstances, par- 
ticularly in regard to my ministry abroad, different problems that con- 
fronted me when I was placed in authority, I know that jby faith and by 
fervent prayer the Lord opened the eyes of my understanding and gave 
me to see what to do, and it was by the power of His Spirit, and 
by that Spirit I know that He lives. I know that Jesus of Nazareth is 
the Christ, the Son of the living God. By that Spirit I know that all 
the ordinances that have been revealed for the benefit and salvation 
of_the human family, which form a part of the everlasting gospel, 
have come from God, and I know that they bring salvation to the 
honest in heart everywhere on the earth, and they will, in good time, 

unto all the races and conditions of men that exist in the spirit world. 
« 

AS TO SONS OF PERDITION 

There are some other little things that people get jangling about, 
I am sorry to say, in some of our classes. For instance : In that sec- 
tion that I just referred to — Section 76 of the Doctrine and Covenants — 
there is one of the grandest revelations that I ever saw in my life in 
any book ; there is nothing in the Bible that compares with it ; there is 
nothing in any book that I ever read that compares with it, for glory, 
for perfection, for detail, for a revelation of the plans of the Father 
for the salvation of his children. Now, in that revelation, we are 
told what the gospel is, and we are told for what it was designed, and 
that the name of Jesus Christ was given to the Savior of the world, 
and that the time will come when He will save all except certain ones 
that are named there. The three different degrees of glory are made 
very plain and clear, I think, to all people who will read with a 
prayerful heart The celestial glory is likened to the sun, because the 
sun is the biggest luminary that we know much about ; the sun in our 
firmament is to us the brightest orb that revolves, and the glory of the 
celestial kingdom is therefore likened to the sun. The glory of the 
•terrestrial kingdom is likened to the moon, because the moon is second 
in our sight in glory ; and the third degree, telestial, is called the glory 
of the stars, and as one star differs from another star in its magnitude 
and glory, according to what we know of astronomy, so it is called the 
telestial kingdom. Now, Jesus Christ will bring forth all these in the 
resurection from the dead, even the malefactors and the extortioners and 



30 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



those who love and make a lie — the wickedest kind of people, after they 
have suffered the penalty of the wrath of God, so that justice is satis- 
fied, will be brought forth into some degree of glory. Those who get into 
the celestial kingdom have to attend to certain ordinances that are ex- 
plained, and those who get into the terrestrial kingdom are to have 
certain qualities that are explained; there are several degrees in that 
one glory; and so in the telestial world, the worst kind of humanity, 
all except those few that are called "Sons of Perdition." 

The meaning of that is made very plain. There was an angel in 
the presence of God, of great authority and power, and he was called 
a Son of the Morning, a bright luminary among the spirits in the 
celestial world, and he rebelled against the Father and tried to get the 
glory that belonged to the Son, and he was turned away and cast 
down with those who followed him, and he was called Perdition, and 
the heavens wept over him when he was cast out. Then those, who 
by his power, while they are in the flesh, after receiving the testimony 
of Jesus Christ, the spirit of prophecy ; after receiving the Holy Ghost, 
turn away from its light altogether and deny the Holy Ghost and deny 
the Father and the Son ; when they thus turn away, they come under 
Satan's power and his dominion and are called Sons of Perdition, and 
these are the exceptions to the rule spoken of in that revelation. All 
the rest are brought forth by the resurrection of the dead into some 
degree of glory, as explained, not in that single verse, as some people 
think it ought to have been, but throughout the whole revelation, and we 
learn clearly that those'who are eventually saved, redeemed, brought 
out of darkness, brought out of punishment, they are brought forth 
by the resurrection of the dead, into one of these degrees of glory, all 
but these exceptions. He says he saves all except them; they shall go 
away with the devil and his angels into everlasting punishment. 

ALL MANKIND, GOOD AND EVIL WILL BE RESURRECTED 

Now then, some of our brethren have taken a notion in their heads 
that when he says all except them, it means they will not be resurrected. 
I would like briefly to refer you to the 88th section of the Doctrine 
and Covenants, in which this subject is elaborated; that is, the things 
revealed in the 76th section in regard to these three different degrees 
of glory into which all these persons are brought forth to salvation, are 
congregated and arranged and organized with these exceptions. Now, 
in the 88th section, you will find that the Lord goes into further 
details, and he shows that when the resurrection comes, those who are 
of a celestial spirit, having obeyed the celestial law, will be quickened 
by the celestial glory. Then comes the next degree, those who receive the 
terrestrial principles, and they come forth and are quickened by the ter- 
restrial glory. Then comes the third group. These are they 
who come forth in the telestial glory, and their glory dif- 
fers as one star differs from another, and they shall each be 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE 31 



judged according to their works, as all will be. So there are 
various degrees of these people who are brought forth according to 
their crimes and their punishments and their redemption; they come 
forth into the glory of the stars, and it says : "They who remain" — who 
are they that remain? It tells us these are the exceptions, these who 
go away with the devil and his angels and are called Sons of Perdition, 
And they who remain shall also be quickened ; but they shall return to 
their own place, because they would not receive that which they might 
have had, but frittered away their time and season for repentance, and 
they go away into everlasting punishment with the devil and his angels. 
Read section 29 of the Doctrine and Covenants, particularly verses 
26-30; also 88: 32, 33. 

"Well, now," say some persons, "won't they be redeemed some 
time ? How do you know ?" Why the Lord does not tell you and 
He says He will not do it. He says it is not revealed ; the height and the 
depth and the extent and the end thereof is not revealed, so do not try 
to find out for yourselves, without the Lord reveals something about it; 
and if He does He will not reveal it to you or me for the Church, but 
will reveal it to us, if at all, for our own enlightenment. I know that 
the Lord reveals things to men for their enlightenment and blessing and 
comfort and qualification in times of stress and pain and deliverance; 
He reveals things to them by the power of the Spirit which searcheth 
all things, yea the deep things of God, but when the Lord is going to 
reveal anything for the Church, He will reveal it to the one man 
appointed for the purpose of revealing something new to the Church. 

OUR STRUGGLE IS TO OBTAIN CELESTIAL GLORY 

Now, brethren, won't it be just as well to leave that alone? Some 
of our brethren are so anxious regarding Lucifer : "Shall not Lucifer 
be redeemed some time? Won't the time come when he will repent?" 
If that time does come, probably he would be restored to something ; but 
repentance does not come to everybody. People sin away the time 
when they can repent — they cannot be saved without it. Repentance is 
a principle of the everlasting gospel of Jesus Christ. Why are some 
folks so anxious about that? Do any of our brothers and sisters 
ever expect to struggle to get into the telestial kingdom? You need 
not bother about that query. Do you expect to get into the terrestrial ? 
You need not bother about that. You are after the celestial kingdom ; are 
we not all on the road, striving to* overcome our little infirmities and 
weaknesses of nature inherited from our ancestors, and to ovecome the 
world and the devil, as well as the flesh? Are we not candidates 
for the celestial glory ? Certainly we are, and what we should be anx- 
ious about is to perform our duty today, to be Latter-day Saints in very 
deed; to serve the Lord, to keep his commandments and to remember 
the commandment of the Father: "There is the Son, hear Him-" Listen

to the voice of Jesus Christ. That is the word of the Lord to us in these 
latter-days, for he is the revealer to us. 

Now then, suppose these people sometime could repent, what have 
you got to do with it? You take the New Testament and read the 
last chapter in the gospel, according to St. John, and you will find a 
little account there of a colloquy between Jesus and Peter. He told 
Peter to feed his sheep ; then he told him to feed' his lambs, and then 
Peter turned around and said, concerning John, "What shall this 
man do?" He said, "If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to 
thee ?" You feed my sheep. That, I think, is a very good lesson for 
all of us. What does it matter to us about Lucifer? What does it 
matter to us whether the Sons of Perdition ever get redemption? The 
Lord has not revealed it, and he says he does not reveal it except to them 
who are made partakers thereof. Don't pretend to know any more than 
your brethren on these matters. I say unto you, whether Lucifer shall 
be redeemed, or these Sons of Perdition be redeemed, what niattereth 
it to you ? You do your duty, you candidates for celestial glory, go on, 
continuing to serve the Lord, keep His commandmnts ; do your duty ; 
if you are called upon to preach abroad — go out into the world and 
preach — you cannot have a better occupation. 

THE JOY OF SERVICE IN THE MISSION FIELD 

I see men nearly every day that have been on missions and come 
home with a smiling countenance; only once in a great while is there 
a fellow looking down his nose — very seldom, indeed, that they do not 
come home thankful for the glorious time they have had ; and I know 
what that is. President Grant was kind enough to allude to my 
services abroad, and I have been abroad or at home in this ministry 
now for over seventy years. When I have been abroad or at home, 
I have been laboring in the same great cause ; it is what I wanted. It 
is what I prayed for, that I might be in the service of the Lord ; that 
I might hejp to build up Zion, and whether at home or abroad, on the 
land or on the sea ; in every nation and country, among every people 
I have visited, I have tried to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son 
of the living God, and bear testimony to His divinity and to 
the divine mission of the Prophet Joseph, which to us, in this dis- 
pensation are blended together in one. For, if Joseph Smith is a prophet 
of God. Jesus Christ is the Son of God, for He was His minister; and if 
Jesus Christ is the Savior of the world, Joseph Smith is His prophet, 
for He gave him the authority to establish His Church. It came in the 
right and proper way, and it is here to stay, thank God. While at home, 
and abroad, my labors have been in this ministry. I thank God for it. 
I prayed to the Lord, when I accepted the gospel, that He would make 
(the truth plain to me, as it was before Him. I did not want a 
man-made religion, nor mere opinions, nor what I could learn from 
what I read and thought, but I wanted to understand the truth as it is 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE 33 



in Christ Jesus. The Lord has manifested a great many things to me, 
individually, that I have never talked about in public, because it was 
not my duty nor my place, but He has been with me ; praise be to His 
holy Name; praise God from whom all blessings flow; praise Jesus 
Christ, our Savior, our Redeemer, our living head in our Church. 
Praise the Holy Ghost for light and truth spread abroad under the 
direction of the Father and the Son. Praise God for all his goodness, 
and for every principle of truth and light revealed for our salvation 
and our comfort. 

I could go on and talk a good deal more, this afternoon, but it 
would not be wise for me, because there are so many others to speak. 
I thank Brother Grant for giving me this privilege this afternoon, ot 
spending a little time in saying a few word's to my brothers and sisters. 
I am anxious for this cause in which we all labor. I feel blessed in my 
soul this afternoon to look down here and see these old friends that I 
have known for so long, and some new friends. God is with them ; they 
are doing a splendid work, preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ for the 
salvation of mankind. It is a good work ; it pays as it goes. I would 
not stop and detain you to tell you about the trials, struggles, and 
vicissitudes I passed through in my early days when I ministered with- 
out purse or scrip— not at all. The Lord was with me, and I thank 
Him that He is with me today, and that I am able to be here and bear you 
my testimony that Jesus of Nazareth is Christ Jesus ; He is the Christ : 
He is the Messiah ; He is the Savior of mankind ; by Him and through 
Him and of Him, under the direction of the Father, were the worlds 
created- By Him and through Him this earth will be saved and crowned 
with glory. By Him and through Him, salvation will come to all who 
can be saved and redeemed and brought forth in the due time of the 
Lord, to receive that which they can have, though they may not get 
that which they might have had. 

BLESSINGS UPON THE PEOPLE 

May God bless you, my brothers and sisters; you good sisters labor- 
ing in the various organizations; you are doing a splendid work; you 
don't get much financial pay for it, but you are paid in yourselves, 
at least, if you have the same experience I have had, you are paid 
every day in the blessings of the Holy Spirit ; in the light of the Lord ; 
in the fellowship of the Holy Ghost ; in the power and demonstration 
of the Spirit in my soul ; in the enlightenment of my mind, that I am 
able to draw near to God and receive from Him His divine light and 
Spirit and blessing and comfort and be a blessing and comfort to a few 
of my fellow creatures. 

God bless you, everyone, in all your stations and places. Be faith- 
ful and true and set God's kingdom first; obey the injunction of the 
Savior, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness," and 
when you quote it do not say "It's." A good many of our writers say, 
"Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and its righteousness," but Jesus 



34 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



said, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God and' his righteousness." Why ? 
Because, as Paul taught the Galatians : "I am not ashamed," said he, 
"of the gospel of Jesus Christ, for in it the righteousness of God is 
revealed, from faith to faith." "It is the power of God unto salvation, 
and therein is the righteousness of God revealed, from faith to faith," 
but when you get the gospel of Jesus Christ, as revealed formerly and 
as revealed in these latter days, as revealed to the Nephites and wher- 
ever the Savior went, when you get that and have faith in the true God, 
the Eternal Father, and in His Son, Jesus Christ, and in the Holy 
Ghost, and you get the gift of the Holy Ghost in and through that, 
the righteousness of God will be revealed from faith toJaith and you 
will take hold of that faith and you will come to a fulness of perfec- 
tion, which may God help us all to do, through Jesus Christ. Amen.

PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 

"As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than 
your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts. For as the rain cometh 
down, and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth 
the earth and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the 
sower, and bread to the eater; so shall my word be that goeth forth out 
of my mouth; it shall not return to me void, but it shall accomplish that 
which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereunto I send it." 

THE NATURE OF THIS CONFERENCE 

The President announced, in his opening remarks, that ninety-two 
years have elapsed since the organization of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints, which occurred on the sixth of April, 1830. 

At the time of the organization, the Lord revealed, in connection 
with other regulations for the government of the Church, that general 
conferences should convene, from time to time, as the requirements of 
the Church might make them necessary. Since that time it has been 
customary, when circumstances have not prevented, for the members 
to meet together in general conference on the sixth of April. 

This is a meeting to which officers of the Church, both general 
and local, are expected to be present, as well as those of the 1 members 
who can conveniently attend. The general condition of the Church 
is considered, its progress noted, the past reviewed, the problems of 
the present discussed and aspirations for the future outlined, as the 
Lord may prompt his servants, who are called to address the people, 
to treat these various topics. 

ADMINISTRATION EPOCHS OF THE CHURCH 

Since the organization of the Church, six men, exclusive jof 
the present administration, have been called to preside over it, to di- 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IV INS 35 



rect its policy, and stand as the mouth-piece of the Lortd to its 
members. 

The administration of each of these men marks an epoch in the 
development of the Church, each as distinct from the other, as was 
the character and temperament of the man who administered its 
affairs. 

Joseph Smith was the first man called of the Lord to preside 
over the Church in this dispensation. Moroni, a messenger sent to 
communicate the will of the Lord to the Prophet, after his first 
great vision, declared to Joseph that the Lord had chosen him for 
the accomplishment of a special work; that las a result of that 
work his name Would be known for good and evil among all na- 
tions, that by some it would be held in honor, and among others 
in reproach. 

THE EPOCH OF RESTORATION 

Referring to the opening of the present gospel dispensation 
Isaiah, the Prophet, from whom I have just quoted, said: "For as 
much as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their 
lips do honor me, but have removed their heart far from me, and 
their fear toward me is taught by the precepts of men; therefore, 
behold, I will proceed to do a marvelous work among this people, 
even a marvelous work and a wonder ; for the wisdom of their wise 
men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall 
be hid." 

Joseph Smith lived to fulfil the words spoken by the angel 
Moroni, and by the Lord through His prophet Isaiah. 

The administration of the Prophet may be referred to as the 
epoch, or period of restoration. Line upon line, precept upon pre- 
cept, the Lord revealed to him, and restored through him, the keys 
and order of the Priesthood, the organization of the Church, and de- 
fined the duties of its members with such fulness that nothing 
is lacking. The keys of the gathering of Latter-day Israel were re- 
stored, as well as those making possible the redemption of the dead. 

, His entire administration was characterized by bitter perse- 
cution. In vain he sought a home for the gathered Saints. At 
Kirtland there was no peace. In Missouri, where the people hoped 
to find a resting place, persecution was more bitter than before. 
For a brief period the Church found peace and rest in Illinois, but 
just when its members began to reap the fruits of their labors, after 
infinite sacrifice, the vials of wrath were poured out upon them 
with greater violence than ever before, and the destruction of the 
Church was threatened. 

With the martyrdom of Joseph the enemies of the Church undoubt- 
edly thought that this had been accomplished. They overlooked the fact 
that the Lord had' said that the works, and designs and purposes 
of the Lord cannot be frustrated, but that the designs of men 
fail. 



36 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



With the death of the prophet the Church was left without a 
direct leader, but not without leadership. Joseph Smith was sur- 
rounded by men of powerful intellect, devoted faith, and unsur- 
passed courage, as clearly fore-ordained for the accomplishment of 
the task before them, as was the prophet himself. 

THE PIONEER EPOCH 

From among these men Brigham Young was chosen to be the 
president of the Church, to direct its policy, under circumstances 
entirely different from those which confronted his predecessor. 

Recognizing the hopelessness of reconciliation with their 
neighbors, determined to find a place where the Saints could wor- 
ship the Lord without molestation, this modern Moses and his 
associates tur/ned their faces westward, and after a journey unparal- 
leled in the history of the world found asylum in these mountain 
valleys, where the body of the Church now resides. 

PARALLEL BETWEEN THE JOURNEY OF MODERN AND ANCIENT ISRAEL 

It is true that Moses led the Israelites out from the Egyptian 
captivity ; the Puritans had left their homes in the old world and 
landed at Plymouth Rock. 

The impulse which prompted each of these great movements, 
which have meant so much to the world and its people, were 
similar, but the circumstances under which they were accomplished 
entirely different. 

The Israelites were going out from a grievous and humiliating 
bondage, and returning to their old home, in the land of their 
fathers. Modern Israel were leaving their homes, the lands of their 
fathers, and were going into a country unknown to them, a country 
uninhabited by civilized man. 

The Israelites were a people of one race, influenced in the ac- 
complishment of their purpose by the traditions and religion of 
their fathers. The Latter-day Saints were composed of 
people gathered from various nations, bringing with them differ- 
ent traditions, different customs and different languages. 

Ancient Israel was separated from their destination by only 
about two hundred and fifty miles, in a direct line, and that over 
a country where great armies have marched from remote times. 
The "Mormon" Pioneers traveled over a road where few had gone 
before, a distance of more than a thousand miles. 

Ancient Israel were led by great occular demonstrations of the 
power of the Lord, and their daily bread was provided by manna 
sent down from heaven. The "Mormon" Pioneers walked by di- 
vine faith, and provided for their daily necessities with the labor 
of their own hands. 

Reaching their destination Ancient Israel found cities already 
built, orchards and vineyards already planted, and flocks and herds 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 



37 



which the Lord delivered into their hands. Modern Israel found 
a desert waste, which could only be redeemed, and made produc- 
tive by infinite toil. ' 

So, I feel justified in saying that this accomplishment has no 
parallel in the history of the world. 

With the arrival of the "Mormon" Pioneers in the Salt Lake 
Valley the wisdom, intelligence and vision of their great leader 
was manifested. The earth, said Brigham Young, is the most 
sacred heritage which God has bequeathed to man. From it he 
obtains all that he possesses that is worth while, and when his 
mortal life is finished he returns to its bosom. Do not, he pleaded, 
be decieved by the lure of gold in California, nor by the precious 
minerals which abound in the mountains surrounding this valley, 
but secure and hold the land. It is the heritage which the Lord 
has held in reserve for you and your children, and must never be 
permitted to pass into the hands of strangers. 

The Saints were gathered from abroad, colonists were sent out 
until every available valley was occupied, towns and villages 
sprang up in desert places, factories, mills, thje trades and indus- 
tries were established and fostered, and the people made as nearly 
independent and self-sustaining as possible under the circum- 
stances which prevailed. 

Such was the administration of President Brigham Young. 
Its outstanding accomplishment was the hegira of the "Mormon" 
people from Illinois to the Rocky Mountains, the gathering of the 
Saints from abroad, and the colonization and redemption of these 
mountain valleys. To me it has always been the great gathering, 
colonization, and industrial epoch in the history of the Church. 
There has never been an epoch like unto it in the past, there will 
be none like it in the future. 

AN EPOCH OF STORM 

The administration of John Taylor followed that of President 
Young. 

During the former administration storm clouds had again 
gathered, which broke with great fury soon after John Taylor as- 
sumed the presidency. The Church and the world were again at 
variance, as they have always been, and must continue to be until 
the doctrines taught by the Redeemer are accepted and applied. 

The marital relations of members of the Church were made the 
pretext for assault. Plural marriage, under certain restrictions, 
had been accepted as a proper relation of sexes. Laws were en- 
acted by the congress prohibiting such marriages, and providing 
punishment for those who persisted in the practice. Prosecutions 
for violations of the law were, frequent, the property of the Church 
was escheated to the Government, resulting in great suffering and 
financial loss. 



38 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



The laws prohibiting plural marriage were regarded as un- 
constitutional and unjust by the Church, and their execution was 
bitterly opposed. Suits were carried to the Supreme Court, which 
upheld the law, and more vigorous steps were taken to enforce it. 
While this storm raged John Taylor stood immovable in his con- 
viction that the anti -polygamy law was unjust, and died without 
making any concession. This was the outstanding feature of his 
administration. 

THE MANIFESTO FORBIDDING PLURAL MARRIAGE 

During the early part of the administration of Wilford Wood- 
ruff, who succeeded John Taylor as president of the Church, the 
contention which had been brought on because of the enforcement 
of the anti-polygamy laws continued. It became evident that 
every available legal means had been exhausted, and that to continue 
the struggle longer would be useless and disastrous. In a revela- 
tion given to the Church, in 1841, the Lord had said: "Verily, 
verily, I say unto you : That when I give a commandment to any 
of the sons of men, to do a work unto my name, and those sons 
of men go with all their might, and with all they have, to perform 
that work, and cease not their diligence, and their enemies come 
upon them, and hinder them from performing that work ; behold, 
it behooveth me to require that work no more at the hands of those 
sons of men, but to accept of their offering." 

President Woodruff issued the declaration known as the 
Manifesto, in which he pledged himself to abide by the law, and 
advised all members of the Church to do likewise. 

This changed attitude of the Church, in regard to plural mar- 
riage, resulted in the restoration of the remnant of property, which 
had been in the hands of the receiver, to the rightful owner. Men 
who had been disfranchised, because of their marital relations, 
were restored to full citizenship, Utah was admitted to the Union 
as a sovereign state, ajnd comparative peace established between 
hitherto warring factions. It was an epoch of great importance 
and concern to the Church. 

LAYING THE FOUNDATION FOR FINANCIAL PROSPERITY 

When Lorenzo Snow succeeded to the Presidency he found 
the finances of the Church in a deplorable condition. As a result 
of the receivership the revenues had been cut off, its resources 
greatly depleted, and heavy obligations had been incurred, with 
no available means for liquidation. He at once eintered upon the 
work of reconstruction, appealed to the people to be more liberal 
in the payment of their tithes and offerings, and promised that 
the burden which rested so heavily upon the Church, and upon 
them, would be lifted if this course were pursued. 

During his short administration many of the debts of the 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. WINS 



39 



Church were paid, and the foundation was laid for the financial pros- 
perity which was to follow. 

BUSINESS EXPANSION AND FREEDOM FROM DEBT 

The administration of President Josieph F. Smith was ushered 
in under more favorable circumstances, in many respects, than 
any which preceded it. As a result of his liberal and wise policy, 
the political animosites which had long obstructed the proper de- 
velopment of both the Church and State were adjusted. Better 
feeling and closer business relations were established between 
members and non-members of the Church. Through his wise and 
conservative business policy the obligations of the Church were 
liquidated, until it was entirely free from debt. Financial pros- 
perity came to the Church and its members. Ma,ny new buildings 
were erected, including office buildings, amusement halls, gymna- 
siums, schools, churches and temples. It was a period of peaceful 
relations with our neighbors, business expansion, and general pros- 
perity the like of which the Church had never before experienced. 

PREACHING THE GOSPEL — THE MAIN RESPONSIBILITY ALWAYS BORNE IN 

MIND 

During the entire period to which I have referred the 'first 
great responsibility resting upon the 1 Church had not for a moment 
been forgotten, nor neglected. When asked by His disciples for a 
sign by which they might recognize the 1 approach of the time when 
He would come in power and glory in the latter days, the Re- 
deemer said, among other things: "This gospel of the kingdom 
shall be preached in all the world, as a witness to every crfeature, 
and then shall the end come." In a revelation given to the Church, 
at a very early day, the Lord said: "This gospel shall be preached 
to every nation, kindred, tongue and people, and the servants of 
the Lord shall go forth saying in a loud voiice, Fear 'God and 
give glory to Him, for the hour of His judgment has come, and 
worship Him that made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and 
the fountains of water." 

While in poverty and distress, in the midst of persecution, or 
when blessed with peace and plenty, the Church has not for a 
moment neglected this first great command. Its missionaries 
have gone into every civilized country of the world, where en- 
trance was permitted, bearing witness to the people that a light 
had broken forth among those who sit in darkness, which was the 
fulness of the everlasting gospel, and warning the people to pre- 
pare the way of the Lord, and make straight His paths, that they 
might be prepared for His kingdom and coming. 

MAGNITUDE OF MISSIONARY WORK 

I have no means by which I can definitely state the number 
of missionaries who have gone into the field, since the organiza- 



40 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



tion of the Church, or the number of years of missionary work 
which has been given, but taking the record of the past twenty 
years, during which period we have kept accurate records, and 
making a very low estimate, the result would be about as follows: 
Sixty thousand aind eighty men have gone to the mission fields, 
we think many more. It has cost, to. send these elders to their fields of 
labor, and bring them back to their homes, at least six millions of 
dollars. The expense of keeping them in the field has not been 
less than eighteen millions of dollars. Counting their earning 
capacity, again a very low estimate, at seventy-five dollars per 
month, would amount to fifty-four millions of dollars, so we have 
a total of seventy-eight millions of dollars, which have been ex< 
pended, in time and money, by the elders of the Church, in carry- 
ing the gospel message to the people of the world since the or- 
ganization of the Church. When it is considered that all of this 
time and money has been given without compensation, the men 
who have accomplished the work having paid their own expenses, 
I feel justified in saying that it is an accomplishment which can- 
not be duplicated in the history of the world. 

When it is remembered that these missionaries have been, 
in the great majority of cases, young men taken from the farms, 
the work shops, the trades and industries, without previous train- 
ing or experience, we exclaim, with Isaiah, a marvelous work and 
a wonder has been accomplished, for the wisdom of the wise has 
perished, and the understanding of the prudent has been hid. Dur- 
ing the past ninety-two years the wise and learned of the world 
have combatted these unlearned men, and have never proved 
them wrong in a single doctrine which they have taught. 

HOME OCCUPATIONS OF MISSIONARIES 

It may be interesting to you, my brethren and sisters, to know 
that during the past ten years, since accurate statistics have been 
kept, the following have been the occupations, of the men who have 
gone into the mission field : There have been of artizans and 
tradesmen, 4 per cent; of men engaged in clerical work, 8.5 per 
cent; professional men 5.7 per cent; engaged in mercantile pur- 
suits; 4 per cent; laborers, 8.3 per cent; not classified, 17.5 per 
cent ; farmers, your boys and girls from the rural districts, 52 per 
cent.. The unclasssified are largely boys just from school, many of 
them from the rural districts, showing that a majority of all the 
missionary work done is by m/en from the farming communities. 

THE PRESENT AND TO US MOST IMPORTANT EPOCH OF THE CHURCH 

This brief review brings us to the present, to us the most 
important epoch in the development of the Church, because it is 
our day, the day when we, who are members of the Church, and 
who direct its affairs, are to prove ourselves. This day has never 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. 1VINS 41 



come before, it will never come again. Tomorrow the sixth of 
April, 1922, will have gone with its successes and failures, its ac- 
complishments, and neglect of duty, and can never be recalled. 

The past is of inestimable worth to us, provided we profit by 
the lessons which it teaches. The future, in so far as the Lord 
has revealed it, through his servants the prophets, is a sure guide 
by which we may prepare for coming events. The present is the 
day of our probation. Will we be equal to the tasks and respon- 
sibilities which are to come, the test which is to be applied? If 
iwe put our trust in the Lord, and devotedly serve Him, as our 
predecessors have done, we shall triumph; if we forget Him, and de- 
pend upon the arm of flesh, we shall fail, as all who have traveled 
down this broad road have hitherto done. 

PROBLEMS CONFRONTING US DANGEROUS AND DIFFICULT 

The problems with which the Church is now confronted, while 
differing from those of the past, are none the less dangerous and 
difficult of solution. 

The Church is not now confronted by the problem of separa- 
tion from other people, by migration to an unknown country, and 
the difficulties of colonization. The political differences which 
have divided the "Mormon" people and their fellow citizens have 
been largely solved. 

After separating ourselves from the world, the world has come 
to us, bringing with it much that is good, much which is bad. 
One thing this chajnged condition has taught us : We are an in- 
tegral part of the great world, and whether we desire it or not, we 
must be influenced, to a greater or less extent, by its invironment with 
which we are surrounded. 

That we are in a world the very foundations of which are 
being shaken by the conflicting creedsl, traditions, and interests of 
its people, none will deny. 

Notwithstanding the ages of effort put forth by the churches 
to turn the hearts of men to the Redeemer of the world, infidelity 
and lack of faith are manifested everywhere. Notwithstanding 
our ages of endeavour to establish suitable conditions for the 
stability and protection of society, lawless men walk the streets 
of every city of our land, who rob and kill for gain, secret com- 
binations ride and burn and destroy by night, who, if appre- 
hended, which is rarely the case, are more seldom convicted by 
our courts and juries, prosecution being excessively expensive, and 
conviction well nigh impossible. 

Notwithstanding our efforts to protect the weak against the 
strong, to maintain purity in our social life, to make the home the 
altar of God, and create through marriage a protection for virtue, 
which should be sacred as life itself, the statistics published by 
any city in our land will show that courtezajns walk the streets 



42 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



with brazen disregard for decency, innocent girls are made the 
victims of libertines, who are rarely punished, and the fountains 
of life are corrupted with impurity. 

Selfishness; ambition for wealth, which under our present sys- 
tem brings power; disregard for law, when it conflicts with our 
personal interests; the combination of wealth, through great cor- 
porate organizations, for the purpose of exercising control over 
the law-making bodies of our country, and the courts by which 
the law is administered, are among the dangers which menace the 
world and threaten us. 

AUTHENTIC VIEWS CONCERNING THESE PROBLEMS 

That I may not be accused of expressing my own views only, 
upon these questions, permit me to read the statements of other 
men. At Chicago, on the 21st of last month, Chief Justicel Scanlon, 
in stating the purpose for which a meeting had been called, de- 
clared that it was for the purpose of discussing means to combat 
and throttle the hold crime has upon the throat of the city. Chief 
of police Fitzmorris said : 

"The city is on the edge of chaos. The work of the police department 
is being undone as fast as the police can do it. Unless this city awakens 
to the emergency which confronts it, the day will come, and it is not far 
distant, when gun men, like Macaulay's New Zealander, will stand on Michi- 
gan Avenue bridge, and exultantly look down upon the ruins of law and 
order." 

James A. Patten, representing the citizens committee, said : 

"It is time for plain talking. The cold facts in the situation are known. 
Men are murdered, property destroyed, the safety and comfort of the com- 
munity are in danger. The murderers are known. They are arrested, 
tried, and turned loose. Thpy have no fear of the police. They sneer at the 
law,, and make a mockery of criminal justice as it is administered in this 
community. This is no time for excuses or promises, it is time for action. 
The turning point has come, decency wins or anarchy triumphs, there is 
no middle course." 

Senator Cummins, of Iowa, who has been for many years a 
member of the United States Senate, and a representative of the 
dominant party now in control of the government, at a meeting 
recently held at Des Moines, said : 

"Washington is merely a place where organizations make war upon 
each other for selfish legislative purposes, organization has gone to such 
length that it is now practically impossible for congress to get an unselfish 
and unbiased opinion on any public question. Where are we to get at 
Washington, when every bit of information that comes to us is from a 
selfish standpoint. Down there it is simply a war between organizations. 
Congressional committees are constantly holding hearings ujpon important 
questions, and I have yet to hear, during this session, a single man come 
to a committee hearing for the purpose of enlightening the committee from 
the public standpoint. All come to urge something which will help the 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVJNS 43 



particular organization with which they arc affiliated. It creates in my 
opinion, a very difficult and alarming situation." 

Do we honor and sustain the civil law? Let one of the wisest 
and best informed bodies of men in the world speak upon that 
subject. I read from a report unanimously adopted by the Judi- 
cial section of the American Bar Association, of the United States. 
I clipped this from Current Opinion, December, 1921 : 

'The judicial section of the American Bar Association, venturing to 
speak for all the judges,, wishes to express this warning to the Amer- 
ican people. Reverence for law, and enforcement of law, depend main'y upon 
the ideals and customs of those who occupy the vantage ground in business 
and society. The people of the United States, by solemn constitutional 
and statutory enactment, have undertaken to suppress t^a age-long evil of 
the liquor traffic. When, for the gratification of their appetites, or the 
promotion of their interests, lawyers, bankers, great merchants and manu- 
facturers, and social leaders, both men and women,, disobey and scoff 
at this law, or any other law, they are aiding the cause of anarchy and 
promoting mob violence, robbery, and homicide, they are sowing dragons' 
teeth, and they need not be surprised when they find that no judicial or 
police authority can save our country or humanity), from reaping the har- 
vest." 

HOW THE CHURCH STANDS ON THESE QUESTIONS 

Against all of these evils the Church stands uncompromisingly 
opposed > and expects the support of every member in the battle 
which is being waged. 

Is there a Church member who is a violator of the prohibition 
law, or any other civil law? Let him repent. Is there onje who 
says the attitude of the Church is changed in relation to the ob- 
servance of the law given of the Lord known as the Word of 
Wisdom, or any other law given of the Lord? Let him be in- 
formed that there has been no change, unless it be that now, more 
than ever before, the observance of these laws is necessary. Is 
there one who in his own strength and pride has forgotten his de- 
pendence upon the Lord, and ceased to pray to him, and teach 
his children to so do. Let him repent and return to the Lord, that 
whether in his banking house, his store, in the work shop, while 
cultivating his fields, or with his flocks and herds upon the plains 
or mountains, his prayers, uttered or unexpressed may ascend to 
the Lord in gratitude for blessings received, and others desired. 

ADMONITIONS 

Remember, my brethren and sisters, that the word of the Lord, 
which goeth forth from His mouth, shall not return unto Him 
void, but shall accomplish the thing whereunto He sent it, and He 
has declared that his Church has been established for the last 
time, never to be destroyed or given to other people. Let us

hold fast to the rod of iron, which is the word of God, and it will 
lead us to the tree of life, taking us safely through this world of 
darkness and confusion. May the( Lord help us all to this end, I 
humbly pray, through Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang, "We thank Thee, O God, for a 
prophet," and the Conference was adjourned until 10 o'clock, Fri- 
day morning, the closing prayer being offered by Elder Edward C. 
Rich, President of the Montpelier stake of Zion. 




SECOND DAY 

The meeting began at 10 o'clock a. m., Friday, April 7, Presi- 
dent Heber J. Grant, presiding. 

President Heber J. Grant announced that the choir and congre- 
gation would sing the hymn, "How firm a foundation ye Saints of 
the Lord." 

After the hymn had been sung, the opening prayer was pronounced 
by Elder William L. Adamson, President of the Blaine stake of Zion. 

The choir and congregation sang, "Redeemer of Israel, our only 
delight." 

PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAWSON 

I wondered, as I sat in the stand yesterday, where President John 
M. Knight got his stentorian voice. If I knew 1 where such voices were 
manufactured, I think I should go and get one. As hq stood there and 
spoke to the congregation, he roared like a, lion, and the building trem- 
bled. I cannot roar. Nevertheless, I may possibly be able to make you 
hear', if I speak straight ahead. 

I was speaking to one brother yesterday, about yes.erday morning's 
meeting, who said, "It was an epoch in our history of conferences." I 
quite agreed with him, because it seemed to me to be a very extraordi- 
nary meeting, a meeting of abounding interest to the Latter-day Saints. 

LESSON FROM THE HOLY BIBLE 

Let me say, brethren and sisters, that the Latter-day Saints are a 
blessed people, for we live in the latter days, and have access to the 
lives and experiences of the inhabitants of the earth from the earliest 
ages. For example, take the Holy Bible ; it is one of the most precious 
books of the world today; it goes back to the very beginning and is 
written in the simplest, purest English. It deals with every phase of 
human nature — both good and bad. It is a work of great literary value, 
and, although it sets forth the gospel of Jesus Christ in its Sfulness, 
which is its principal value, it nevertheless reads like a romance — so 
absorbing is the story. What can be of greater interest to the human 
family than the story of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden? Thev 
were our first parents, the root from which we sprang. It is good 'o 
know (his, and to become somewhat familiar with their history. The 
Bible tells us that Adam and Eve were subjected to a great tempta- 
tion and yielded, that is to say. the woman yielded, and the man, volun- 
tarily shared in her transgression. This experience seemed to be neces- 
sary for them to have, for we are told in holy writ that "Adam fell that 
man might be, and man is that he might have joy." There was, there- 
fore, a great purpose in it. The story tells us that Cain, one of Adam's 



46 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



sons, through the spirit of greed and jealousy, rose up and slew his 
brother Abel. Thus was sin, and the greatest of all sins, introduced in- 
to the world. This was the first murder. There have been many since. 
Many generations pass away before we come to Noah and the flood. 
During those long years, the children of Adam multiplied greatly ; right- 
eousness they followed not, but were steeped in all manner of s ; n and 
debauchery. Noah the prophet, preached to them the gospel of re- 
pentance for one hundred and twenty years, but his message and 
warning were rejected. It was then the flood came and cleansed the 
earth of violence and wickedness. 

THE THREE GREAT PATRIARCHS 

Most absorbing is the story of the three great patriarchs : Abra- 
ham, Isaac and Jacob. They were indeed noble men. The Lord, 
Himself, declared that He was the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. 
Did man ever before or after, receive such great distinction? Could 
greater honor have been conferred upon them? Then, we should 
remember that the integrity and faith of Abraham was so great thai 
the Lord put upon him a blessing, under oath, saying, that unto him 
and his children, the land of Canaan should be given and that in him 
and in his seed, all the families of the earth should be blessed. This 
same glorious promise was also put upon Isaac and Jacob. On one 
occasion Jacob wrestled with an angel all night, and would not let 
him s;o until he had received a blessing. The angel thereupon said 
that his name should no more be called Jacob but Israel, for. said he, 
as a prince hast thou power with God and with man, and hast pre- 
vailed. Jacob was the father of twelve sons, from whom sprang the 
twelve tribes of Israel. We are of Israel. 

THE STORY OF JOSEPH IN EGYPT 

Who can read the story of Joseph and the Children of Israel in 
Egypt, of their bondage, and of their deliverance from bondage 
by ten great miracles, without being touched to the heart? It is a 
fascinating story, brothers and sisters, this story of Joseph, who was 
sold info slavery in the days of his youth, and was confronted with 
a great and lerrible temo f ation by a beautiful woman. He resisted 
tbe temptation, and, for this evidence of his virtue, he was cast into 
prison. After two vears, be was brought out again, and almost im- 
mediately, was lifted to well nigh unlimited authority under Pharaoh; 
and, through the wisdom that was given him, he not only saved Egypt, 
but saved his father's house from starvation by famine. No storv 
in fiction is of greater interest, and certainly, no storv of fiction is 
quite as profitable, to my mind, as the journeying of the Children 
of Israel in the wilderness, and later, of tbeir occupation of the 
Promised Land, or Palestine.

THE KINGS AND PROPHETS 

The vital lessons taught by the disobedience of King Saul and 
of the humility and obedience of David in his early life, and of his 
great sin in later life, are of great importance to the world and most 
instructive. 

The story of Daniel and the three Hebrews in Babylon exhibits 
a sublime faith, for, notwithstanding the fact they were condemned to 
death by the lions and by fire, nevertheless, they steadily refused to 
bow down to man but continued openly to worship the God of heaven ; 
and, mark you, brethren and sisters, the God of heaven rescued them 
from their extremity. Oh! it is a wonderful lesson indeed. 

The great and wonderful prophecies of Isaiah, Ezekiel, Moses, 
Jeremiah, Daniel and others give a value to the Bible that cannot be 
over-estimated. 

THE STORY OF JESUS CHRIST MOST WONDERFUL OF ALL 

But, the sweetest, most touching, most wonderful story of all the 
wonderful stories in the Bible, is the story of Jesus Christ and His min- 
istry in Jerusalem. In that story is set forth the gospel of Jesus Christ 
in its fulness, with all of its gifts, rites and powers, and Priesthood, that 
will save and exalt men in eternal glory, if they will but repent and, 
render obedience to it. Here also is given an account of the organi- 
zation of the true Church of God, consisting of apostles, prophets, 
pastors, teachers, high priests, seventies, elders, priests, teachers and 
deacons. There is nothing in literature, brethren and sisters, thai 
is quite comparable to the parables of Jesus — so simple, so direct, so 
profound, so God-like. They seem almost to cover our human ex- 
perience. 

The greatest event, however, in the life of the Savio:-, was the 
crucifixion upon Mount Calvary, for therein did He give His life 
in atonement for the sins of the world, and by this sacrifice — the 
greatest sacrifice ever witnessed — he has drawn us to Him and put us 
under an obligation of eternal duration. 

The lives and acts of the apostles of Jesus, who preached the 
gospel extensively, and who, in the end, were martyred, like their 
Master, teaches a lesson that will bear fruit to the end of time- 

IMPORTANCE OF THE STUDY OF THE BIBLE 

I have thus spoken of the Bible to emphasize the importance of 
its study, which, if mastered, would be quite equal, I am sure, to a 
college education. This holy record has come down to us, under the 
providence of the Lord, through the years. It is a most precious treas- 
use and will be found in nearly every household, but I ferr it is hot 
read as often, and is not pondered over as deeply, by the Latter-day 
Saints, as it should be. God has given us His word and He will no*, 
be mocked.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



MODERN SCRIPTURE OF EQUAL VALUE 

. In the brief talk that I have made this morning, I have said! 
nothing about the Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, and the 
Pearl of Great Price, standard Church works, which are of equal 
value to the Bible, and should have our closest and most careful at- 
tention. The Lord has poured down from above and brought up from 
beneath a flood of light and truth for the benefit of mankind and we 
should remember that he reigns in the heavens and holds in his hand 
the destinies of the earth. He will not condone ignorance, for "the 
glory of God is intelligence," and if we would be like him, we must 
become intelligent. 

Brothers and sisters, may the Lord bless us and help us to do our 
duty by keeping His commandments and by studying His word. This 
is my prayer, in the name of the Lord, Jesus Christ, Amen. 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 

I hope that you are enjoying this Conference as much as I am. 
I sat here yesterday and rejoiced in the good things we listened to. 
This morning, the same spirit is present, and I sincerely desire 
that I may be blessed of the Lord to say something that will be 
helpful. 

GODS PROMISE TO THE TEACHER 

The responsibility of standing in the presence of a congrega- 
tion like this, about ten thousand people, is great, and yesterday 
Dr. Thomas Nixon Carver, of Harvard, so expressed himself. 
President Walter E. Clark, of the Nevada University, and President 
Charles A. Lory, of the Colorado Agricultural College, felt the 
responsibility of standing here without preparation when they 
were suddenly called to speak. The Latter-day Saints have been 
admonished to put their trust in the Lord when they arc called to 
advocate the gospel of Jesus Christ, and in the year 1832, elders 
were advised not to take thought beforehand what they should 
say, but to treasure up in their minds continually (be words of 
life with the assurance that they would be inspired to mete out 
what was needed to every man. I take it for granted that applies 
to all Israel ; so you men who are presidents of stakes and bishops 
of wards — when you stand in the presence of your flock, if you 
have stored your mind, as our heavenly Father indicated should, 
be done, you have the promise from Him that He will give to 
you and to the congregation, what is necessary for that particular 
occasion.

COMPLIMENTS FROM PROMINENT VISITORS 

Yesterday we received compliments from our visiting edu- 
cators, previously named,, that were surely gratifying. It was 
very interesting to me to see how 1 they partook of the spirit of our 
gathering. I have often observed, and I think most of you who 
have had missionary experience, will bear me out, that no good 
man or woman can come under the influence of the faithful mem- 
bers of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and with- 
hold their commendations of what they observe while with us. When 
they leave us, sometimes it is different, but while they are under that 
influence that comes from the Lord, possessed by His servants, who are 
serving Him, they are usually pleased to commend what they have 
seen and felt. That was a wonderful compliment that was paid us 
yesterday by Dr. Carver, who is a student of political economy and 
national history. He said (I am not going to try to quote him 
but I am going to quote the impression he gave me) that if he 
were looking for information as lo how to build a real common- 
wealth or # empire, he would come to the Latter-day Saints in 
this part of America. If he and other great men would learn that 
it was not man's wisdom that planned what he saw here, but that 
it was inspired by our heavenly Father, they would realize, as 
we do, that it is not only the best plan by which to build an empire 
in this world, but a sure foundation for eternal happiness in the 
world to come, 

MF^T ARE REACHING OUT FOR THE SPIRITUAL 

President Grant read, yesterday, an extract from the annual 
report of President Nicholas Murray Butler, of Columbia Univer- 
sity, for 1920, that calls our attention to the fact that men are 
thinking seriously, and they are looking out for something dif- 
ferent from what the world already has. I believe I will read a 
paragraph cr two from the same report : 

"There can be no cure for the world's ills and no abatement of the world's 
discontents until faith and the rule of everlasting princip'e are again restored 
and made supreme in the life of men and of nations. These millions of man- 
made gods, these myriads of personal idols, must be broken up and destroyed, 
and the heart and mind of man brought back to a comprehension of the real 
meaning of faith and its place in life. This cannot be done by exhortation or 
by preaching alone. It must be done also by teaching ; careful, systematic, 
rational teaching, that will show in a simple language which the uninstructed 
can understand what are the essentials of a permanent and lofty morality, of 
a stable and just social order, and of a secure and sublime religious faith. 

"Here we come upon the whole great problem of national education, its 
successes and its disappointments, its achievements and its problems yet un- 
solved. Education is not merely instruction — far from it. It is the leading of 
the youth out into a comprehension of his environment, that, comprehending, 
he may so act and so conduct himself as to leave the world better and happier 
for his having lived in it. This environment is not by any means a material 
thing alone. It is material, of course, but, in addition, it is intellectual, it is 



50 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



spiritual. The youth who is led to an understanding of nature and of eco- 
nomics and left blind and deaf to the appeals of literature, of art, of morals 
and of religion, has been shown but a part of that great environment which 
is his inheritance as a human being. The school and the college do much, but 
the school and the college cannot do all. Since Protestantism broke up the 
solidarity of the ecclesiastical organization in the western world, and since de- 
mocracy made intermingling of state and church impossib'e, it has been neces- 
sary, if religion is to be saved for men, that the family and the church do their 
vital cooperative part in a national organization of educational effort. The 
school, the family and the Church are three cooperative educational agencies, 
each of which has its weight of responsibility to bear. If the family be weak- 
ened in respect to its moral and spiritual basis, or if the Church be neglectful 
of its obligation to offer systematic, continuous and convincing relig'ious in- 
struction to the young who are within its sphere of influence, there can be 
no hope for a Christian education or for the powerful perpetuation of the 
Christian- faith in the minds and lives of the next generation and those im- 
mediately to follow. We are trustees of a great inheritance. If we abuse 
or neglect that trust wc are responsible before Almighty God for the infinite 
damage that wi'l be done in the life of individuals and of nations." 

THE DANGER T! I T CONFRONTS THE WORLD 

I rejoice to find mc who are thinking, as that man thinks, 
of the necessity of spiritual education. The danger that confronts 
this world today is similar to that of the ages past. Calamity has 
overtaken the nations where men and women have departed from 
the teaching of the true and living God and have accepted the 
philosophies of uninspired men ihstead. Having turned away 
from those glorious truths that emanate from the source of all 
knowledge, they have been led captive by the fallacies of those who 
have set themselves up as wiser than their Creator. 

History repeats itself. We read in the Old Testament the 
circumstances that surrounded the people at the time of the flood. 
We are informed that they were not destroyed tmtil they had 
been fully warned. For one hundred and twenty years Noah, a 
prophet of God, went to and fro among the people, calling on them 
to abandon their wickedness. He warned them that unless they 
repented of their sins and turned to the Lord, destruction would 
overtake them. One hundred and twenty years of pleading to do 
right was followed by the flood that destroyed all flesh not pre- 
served in the ark. Bcause Noah was indeed a prophet of God, 
and had only told the people what the Lord had directed, his 
promise was fulfilled, he was vindicated, and the earth received 
its baptism of water. Only the little handful that believed in the 
prophet of God and listened to his wise counsels, were saved. 

WARNING MESSENGERS 

Yesterday President Ivins informed us that we have had 60,- 
080 missionaries go out from this Church into the world, since 
1830. Think of it, more than sixty thousand men, possessing divine 
authority, imbued with a desire to save humanity from the calam- 
ity that threatened ; men who have paid their own expenses, and 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 



51 



with a burning desire in their souls to uplift mankind, have gone 
to the ends of the earth calling attention to the fact that there is 
only one true and living God, proclaiming the divine mission of 
the risen Redeemer, giving of their time and their talents and all 
that God has given to them, to the end that the world might be 
spared the distresses that have overtaken it in the ages that are 
past. Now the average mission is about two years, that means 
more than one hundred twenty thousand years of individual serv- 
ice, instead of one hundred twenty years; and if the Lord, after 
one hundred twenty years teaching the truth through His servant 
Noah, found it necessary, because of the wickedness of men, to 
destroy all but eight, it is not surprising to me that, after one 
hundred twenty thousand years of preaching the gospel among 
the children of men, and their refusal to accept the truth as it 
has been delivered in this latter day, the sorrows of the world are 
multiplying. Think of the condition of humanity today. On every 
hand men are suspicious of one another; nation is jealous of na- 
tion, the pursuit of wealth and popularity occupy much of the at- 
tention of the majority. Immorality, murder, robbery and suicide 
appear to increase, and unless the people of the earth reform their 
lives, destruction is sure to follow, for the Lord has declared it. 
Where, in the world, will you go to find a people such as the one 
that you are a part of, most of whom have placed their all upon 
the altar, where nearly all of those who have been called into serv- 
ice have said, in substance: "Here, Lord, am I, what would you 
have me do?" 

At the present time the world is in distress, not because of 
shortage of food, nor for lack of money, not because there is not 
clothing enough ; but because of the suspicion that is in the hearts 
of men; the distrust that everywhere prevails and the determina- 
tion on the part of the few to possess more than they can possibly 
enjoy. Fortunately for us the gospel of Jesus Christ has taught 
us a better way, and in His great mercy our Lord continues to 
teach us and bless us. My soul rejoices as I look over these great 
mountains and valleys, and I realize that this is the heritage of 
the sons and daughters of God, gathered from (he nations of the 
earth. They have heard the warning voice- — "Come out of her, 
my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye re- 
ceive not of her plagues. "Seek ye first the kingdom of God and His 
righteousness" has been the cry that has rung in the ears of modern 
Israel, and because they have received a witness that the gospel 
has been restored again ; because they have learned for them- 
selves that God really does speak to his children upon the earth, 
men and women by thousands have been willing to part company 
with those with whom they have associated and loved, and leave 
the homes of their ancestors to cast their lot with this much mis- 
represented and despised people. And they have lived to realize 



52 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

the remainder of the promise, "And all these things shall be 
added," for surely the material blessings of life have been be- 
stowed upon us. 

OUR BLESSINGS AND OBLIGATIONS 

When we look back over the record of the past and think 
that since the year 1830, with a little organization of six members, 
unpopular then as it is now and opposed by the adversary in every 
possible way, glorious truths of the eternal gospel have been dis- 
seminated and accepted by men and women anxious to serve God, 
the teaching of the humble elders has appealed to their reason, 
with the result that from that nucleus of six has developed a 
Church of hundreds of thousands of our Father's children, created 
in His image, whose spirits were created by Him, who have earned 
the right to come into the world to work out their eternal exalta- 
tion. These have joined the Church and have been willing to in 
cur the unkind feelings of former friends and the hatred of the 
world, in order that they might please their heavenly Father and 
obtain eternal happiness in His celestial kingdom. It is true that 
you will not find in any place else in the world so perfect a form of 
government as has been given to the Church with which we are 
identified. This is the Lord's way ; Joseph Smith did not, of his 
own wisdom, lay the foundation for this Church; Brigham Young, 
of his own wisdom did not plan what we behold in these valleys ; 
those men were inspired by the same power that directed Moses 
when he led ancient Israel into the wilderness. The same Father 
in heaven lives today, His power prevails and the evidence of it 
is seen in the development of His children. While we enjoy all 
these wonderful blessings, we do not feel to criticise those who 
do not comprehend the truth, we do not feel to find fault with the 
men and women of other churches or out of the churches who 
cannot understand ; but, on the contrary, the gospel teaches us 
to have charity for all and to love our fellows. The Savior said: 

"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and 
with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, this is the first and great 
commandment. 

"And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor 
as thyself. On these two commandments" hang all the law and 
the prophets." 

Brethren and sisters, if the gospel of Jesus Christ, as delivered 
to you, has not planted that feeling of love in your hearts for 
your fellow men, then I want to say that you have not enjoyed 
the full fruition of that wonderful gift that came to earth when 
this Church was organized. As I go to and fro in the earth and 
find opportunity to mingle with our Father's children in various 
lands and climes, many of them honored because of their intellect 




ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH S3 

i 

and because of their virtues, I rejoice to realize that these are our 
brothers and sisters. It is to them that the gospel has been sent, 
a,nd upon us, as elders of this Church, has been laid the obligation 
to go into all the world and preach the gospel unto every creature. 
We have received a wonderful gift, but with that gift comes a 
great responsibility. We have been blessed of the Lord with a 
knowledge beyond our fellows, and with that knowledge comes 
the requirement that we divide it with His children wherever they 
may be. So, while we are here comfortably situated in the 1 valleys 
of these great mountains — as communities by ourselves, in many 
cases, we must not forget that wherever the sun shines our 
Father's children are there. We must not forget that wherever 
His children are, He is seeking after them. He is desirous that 
they should know Him. He is anxious that they should have tak- 
en from their minds the delusions that have been placed there 
by the adversary of all righteousness. For that reason, He has be- 
stowed upon men in this latter day, a knowledge of the old gospel, 
and has required us to disseminate His truth among His 
children wherever opportunity offers. It is not an easy task; it 
is not a pleasant thing, perhaps, to be called out into the world, 
to leave our dear ones, but I say to you that it will purchase for 
those who are faithful, for those who discharge that obligation as 
they may be required, peace and happiness beyond all under- 
standing, and will prepare them that, in due time, when life's 
labor is complete, they will stand in the presence of their Maker, 
accepted of Him because of what they have done. 

THE WORLD IN NEED OF OUR MINISTRY 

We must not be idle. This world is in need of our ministry. 
Our Father's children everywhere are anxious to know what they 
should do, but, by reason of the evil influences that have pervaded 
the earth, they have been deceived ; honorable men of the earth 
are blinded to the truth ; and the adversary continues with his 
work, destroying, not individuals alone, but, as in the great war 
that recently filled all nations with alarm, millions of God's chil- 
dren are wiped out and millions more are made miserable. The 
adversary is at work, and the only power that can neutralize his 
influence is the gospel of Jesus Christ. The churches of the world 
are trying, in their way, to bring peace into the hearts of men. 
They are possessed of many virtues and many truths, and accom- 
plish much good, but they are not divinely authorized. Neither 
have their priests been divinely commissioned. 

ADVICE TO THE HEARERS OF OUR MESSAGE 

I want to call your attention to the fact that when the boy 
Prophet knelt in the woods and when he asked the Father of us 
all which of the churches he should join, .he was warned that 



54 



GENERAL CONEERENCE. 



he should join none of them, "For,'' said the Lord, "they worship 
me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me. They teach 
for doctrine the commandments of men. They have a form of god- 
liness, but they deny the power thereof." When the Lord said 
that, he was not condemning all his children, but he was stating 
the truth that has been manifested since the gospel was restored. 
When He organized His Church, it was not intended that men 
should be discouraged or disappointed, who had joined other 
churches, but it was desired that all the virtues, all the blessings 
that were worth while, all the truth that they had acquired in 
their church organizations might remain with them and that they 
might take it with them when they embraced the gospel of Jesus 
Christ- — verily the power of God unto salvation. We have never 
asked any good Catholic:, Methodist or Presbyterian to give up 
any virtue or truth that has been possessed by him in the organi- 
zation with which he has been identified, but with all the power 
that a numerically weak organization could exert we have said 
to the men and women of this world : Keep all the good that you 
have acquired, and go to the Lord in mighty prayer and learn 
from Him and that His gospel has again been restored upon the earth. 
Learn from Him that His truth is here and that there are men liv- 
ing who possess divine authority conferred by Him. Go to Him. 
Go to the Lord, and ask Him that you may know the proper 
course to pursue. Surely intelligent men can see that all these 
various deviating paths cannot lead back into the presence of our 
Lord, but there is a path and He who marked it out has all power 
in heaven and earth. He has ordained that His gospel should be 
proclaimed to His children not in unkindness, not in harshness 
but with love unfeigned, that they may, before it is too late, 
investigate His truth and turn from the error of their ways and 
be wor;hy to be received by Him when the time comes for Him to 
establish Hio kingdom. 

WHAT THE WORLD NEEDS 

My brothers and sisters, I rejoice in the opportunity that has 
come to me. I am grateful for the gospel of Jesus Christ, I am 
thankful for the companionship of my brothers and sisters in this 
Church. I appreciate the opportunity to meet, from time to time, in- 
telligent men in the world, who, like the president of Columbia 
University, see that this great nation must reform, that there is 
need for the people of this world to retrace their steps and get 
back to the foundation that was laid by the Master of heaven and 
earth, the foundation of faith, repentance and baptism by immer- 
sion for the remission of sins, and the reception of the Holy Ghost 
under the hands of those possessing divine authority. That is 
what the world needs. I am grateful indeed that many are looking 
that way. They have been going blindly along a pathway that 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 55 



has led to sorrow and distress, but there has been placed within 
reach a remedy for all ills — the gospel of Jesus Christ. There has 
been mapped out for all a path that, while it is narrow, and dif- 
ficult to follow, leads back to the Father of us all ; and there is 
no other path that leads there. Knowing that, how grateful we 
should be that there has come to us in these latter days, a knowl- 
edge of this truth, and oh, how happy we ought to be that we are 
permitted to partake of itL 

That the Lord may add His blessing; that the knowledge of 
this glorious truth may burn in our hearts : that we may jnot be 
led to the right nor to the left, by the cunning craftiness of the 
adversary, but day by day, with faith planted in our souls, that 
we may go forward, with a desire to be worthy of Him, in whose 
likeness we are, desirous of leading back to Him, all His children 
wherever they may be; and in the end. as a result of our faith and 
devotion, we may find many of His sons and daughters gathered 
into His glorious kingdom, to be our companions throughout the 
ages of eternity, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

A sacred solo entitled, "Come, come to me," was sung by Louise 
Watson. 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 

I realize, my brethren and sisters, that this is a splendid oppor- 
tunity afforded to deliver a message to the people, there being so 
many in attendance. I also realize, somewhat, the responsibility of 
such an undertaking and almost feel to shrink from the responsibility. 

It is my purpose to occupy but a few moments, and while doing so 
I desire the faith and prayers of the Latter-day Saints present. I 
am very glad to be able to say that my feelings have been in perfect 
accord with the spirit and instructions of the conference, both yes- 
terday and today. 

WE CARRY OUR RELIGION INTO OUR DAILY WORK 

I desire to refer briefly to some of the statemejnts made by one 
of our honored visitors who spoke briefly in the conference yester- 
day morning. I refer to the remarks of Mr. Lory, from Colorado, 
in which he stated that we must learn to carry our religion into our 
every day work. 

If there is any one thing that we have tried to impress upon 
the minds of the Latter-day Saints from the beginning, it has been 
the necessity for carrying our religion into our daily work, and I be- 
lieve there is no other people upon the earth who has so fully and 
well accomplished this as have the Latter-day Saints ; yet, I realize 
that there is opportunity for much improvement. Our understanding 




56 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



is not that we are here upon the earth for the purpose of accumulat- 
ing the wealth of this world, with which to purchase the luxuries and 
pleasures of life. Our purpose here is more exalting, these other 
things, temporal, being but a means to a nobler end. 



In conversation with some prominent people in Arizona a few 
years ago, while paying a visit to the Roosevelt dam, when it was 
in course of construction, the leading draftsman upon the works 
asked me this question: "How is it, Mr. Richards, that your people 
are so successful as colonizers and pioneers?" The ajnswer came to 
me very readily, "Because, with us, it is a religious principle," and 
then I proceeded to explain that we pioneer new countries and 
colonize— not from a selfish viewpoint, but that we may prepare a 
place for those who gather in fulfilment of the predictions of the 
prophets, to assist in the establishment of God's kingdom upon the 
earth ; that our religion is one of service and helpfulness to one an- 
other, and this is one of the means by which we are able to manifest 
it. 



Another remark of Mr. Lory's was, that all that he observed 
pertaining to our people and of this city of Salt Lake and of this 
tabernacle, the construction of which President Grant had briefly 
explained as an evidence of the wisdom of the president of the 
Church who designed it, were on the positive side. That made an im- 
pression upon my mind ; and I thought, too, that our religion is a 
positive religion, from beginning to end ; that those who are in op- 
position to us and the doctrines which we teach are negative: We 
affirm and they deiny. You may take the principles and ordinances, 
one by one, as we declare their necessity for man's salvation anid 
exaltation, and you will find this principle involved, and the same 
with the gospel as a whole. It is a satisfaction to one to have been 
right on any question, and a disappointment to have been wrong ; 
and the greater and more important the question involved, the greater 
the satisfaction or the disappointment as the case may be. There is 
no other question so great, that has moved the people of the world in 
different dispensations as that of religion or salvation. What does 
salvation mejJn? How is it to be obtained? The religion of the 
Latter-day Saints answers these questions perfectly. It is the divi- 
sion upon this question that has made the various religious organi- 
zations that are upon the earth today. If there is a God in heaven, 
and there is ; and if the soul of man is immortal, and it is, the time 
will come when these facts will be generally known. If the gospel 
which we have received alnd are teaching to the world is indeed the 
gospel of Jesus Christ, the only true plan of life and salvation, and 
it is, the time will come when men and women generally will know 



WHY THE SAINTS ARE SUCCESSFUL PIONEERS 



OUR RELIGION A POSITIVE RELIGION 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 



57 



this fact. Then the disappointment of those who have rejected the 
prophets of this day and the revelations which God has given us, by 
which men and women might be saved, will be supremely great ; while 
the satisfaction of those who have accepted the gospel, and have 
made it the guiding star in their lives, will be correspondingly great. 

NEED OF PROFITING BY THE EXPERIENCE OF OTHERS 

"History repeats itself." We are told that, "Experience is a dear 
school, but that fools will learn in no other." I think we may apply 
this to individuals and peoples, alike. Not only should we learn from 
our own experience and from things which we may read and study 
from books and which may be told us by those who have the authori- 
ty to interpret the mind and will of God, but we should profit by the 
experiences of others. It has been a weakness of mankind, from the 
beginning, that we will not profit by the experiences of others; we 
must experience these things ourselves. Several references have been 
made already in this conference to the destruction of the ante-dilu- 
vians, because of their wickedness and because they rejected the mes- 
sage and messengers sent to them of the Lord. It does seem that 
in nearly every dispensation the people have not been prepared for 
that which God has had to give them, notwithstanding He, who 
knows the end from the beginning, has raised up prophets who have 
foretold the coming of events. So, it was with the ante-diluvians, 
and they were swept from off the earth with a flood. We should 
not stop there, in considering the seriousness of the consequences of 
their rejecting the prophets and the gospel which was sent to them. 
We are told in the third chapter of First Peter, that Christ went and 
preached to those people who were disobedient in the days of Noah, 
while the ark was a preparing. They had been shut up in prison, 
so characterized by Isaiah aJixl others of the prophets for about 
twenty-four hundred years. Just the character of their imprison- 
ments, I do not understand ; but one of our Book of Mormon proph- 
ets speaks of it as a fearful, awful, looking forward to the time 
when the fiery indignation of the wrath of God should be poured out 
upon them. Then we should remember this, too, which the Lord has 
revealed through the prophet Joseph, found recorded in the 76th 
Section of the Doctrine and Covenants, that those of the terrestrial 
kingdom, of which the moon is typical, include those who were dis- 
obedient in the days of Noah. When we think of their physical de- 
struction, their spiritual imprisonment, and their being consigned to 
the terrestrial kingdom, we are impressed with the seriousness of their 
mistake and the greatness of their disappointment. It is a terrible 
thing to reject the prophets and their message. All the dispensations 
since that time, should have profited by the unwise course and con- 
duct of this people and the wisdom of the conduct of Noah and his 
family, who were true and faithful. The cities of Sodom and 
Gommorrah were burned by fire because of the wickedness of the 



58 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



people and because they rejected the messsengers that had been sent 
them of the Lord. The same old story, and if we knew the further 
results, we would, perhaps, discover that they would be in the same 
class with those alnte-diluvians who were destroyed by the flood. 

There is the case of Jonah's preaching to the great city of Nine- 
veh. This shows the other side of the picture; how through 
conversion and repentance of the people, from the king upon his 
throne to the least member of that great city, the wrath of God and 
His judgments were turned aside and the people and the city were 
spared. 

We come to Jerusalem. The Lord sent Lehi, Jeremiah and 
other prophets, to tell the people of their wickedness, and call 
them to repentance but their message was rejected and the city was 
destroyed. Again, when the Savior came, in the meridian of time, 
lie came to His own but His own received Him not, and they were 
cursed and scattered and became a hiss and a byword among all 
nations. As a rule the word of the Lord, the gospel of Christ, has 
not been popular, it has been rejected by all except a few. It was so 
in the days of Isaiah, who said, "Lord, who hath believed our report?" 
or the equivalent of saying, "Lord, not many have received the 
gospel" ; and in the New Testament, we read of the days of Christ, 
"Not all have obeyed the gospel, for, as Esaias saith, 'Lord who hath 
believed our report?'" 

THE MESSAGE OF THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS 

The Lord has raised up a prophet in these last days, and he 
has been succeeded by other prophets, who have led this people, as 
the Lord's mouth-piece, not only to the chosen people of the Lord, but 
to the whole world ; and for almost a century, we have been trying 
to convince the world that God has spoken from the heavens ; that 
He has revealed Himself and His Son, Jesus Christ, and that the 
Father is indeed a resurrected immortal and glorified being, having 
a body of flesh and bones, and spirit like His Son after His resur- 
rection, and that the Son ascended to heaven with His resurrected 
body, and retains it in the heavens and will come with that same 
body to reign and rule upon the earth as King of kings and Lord 
of lords. How many have received this message ? It is but telling 
the old story over again, that there are but few who have accepted 
it ; the same with other gospel principles. The gospel has been re- 
stored, i ; n fulfilment of the predictions of many prophets. The Sa- 
vior, Himself, said, "This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached 
in all the world, for a witness unto all nations, and then shall the end 
come." Just prior to the coming of the Lord, then, this gospel which 
Jesus taught, must be taught again to the world. John, the Reve- 
lator, declared that he saw in the then future, the restoration of the 
gospel by an angel. It has been so restored. Daniel, in the inter- 
pretation that the Lord gave him of Nebuchadnezzar's dream, saw 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 



59 



a kingdom which God, Himself, would set up in the last days, that 
should never be thrown down or given to another people. That 
kingdom has been established, and we have been trying for nearly a 
century to convince the world of this fact. How many of all the one 
hundred ten millions of people in these United States have accepted 
the message? A mere handful, less than half a million. 

The coming of our Lord is nigh ; the wars and rumors of wars, 
famines, pestilence, apostasy and wickedness bespeak the near ap- 
proach of His coming, and we have been giving this message to the 
people for about ninety years, pleading with them to repent and pre- 
pare the way and put on the wedding garments, to fill their lamps that 
they might be prepared to go out and meet the bridegroom. How 
many have received the message? The same old story — history re- 
peats itself, men and nations have to learn, it seems, by their own 
experience, and many will suffer bitter disappointment and condem- 
nation. 

May the Lord bless those of us, who have embraced the 
gospel, and enable us to be true and faithful and may He have mercy 
upon those who are in spiritual darkness, and who have honest hearts, 
and lead them to hear, to understand, and to obey its truth ; I pray in 
Jesus' name. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 

I was praying in my heart that whoever should speak at this 
time it would not be Brother McKay, for the very same reason which 
has been expressed, and I am glad that I have been called on, be- 
cause it will soon be over. 

TOO LITTLE TIME SPENT IN PROPER DISCUSSION OF THE PRINCIPLES 

OF THE GOSPEL 

I feel my weakness in standing before you at this time, and yet, 
I have been very happy, because throughout this conference the testi- 
mony has been one of preaching of the gospel of Jesus Christ, and 
there is nothing that appeals to me, that finds response in my soul, 
quite so much as the preaching of the simple principles of the everlast- 
ing gospel. The people are not taught these principles enough. We 
do not spend any too much time in discussion, that is of the proper 
kind, I mean, of these principles which the Lord has revealed for our 
salvation; nor do we know any too much concerning them. 

JESUS CHRIST REDEEMER OF THE WORLD 

Much has been said in the conference in relation to the warning 
of the people, and in admonishing the Latter-day Saints to observe 
the laws and the ordinances of the gospel, which have been given us 
for our salvation. We believe in the Lord, Jesus Christ, as the 
Redeemer of the world. No Latter-day Saint can believe anything 



60 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



contrary to that. It is true that those who profess to be Christians, 
in large part at least, do not accept Him as the Redeemer, do not 
look upon Him as the Son of God, are not willing to believe that He 
died for the remission of sins, for the transgression of our first 
parents, and that we, through repentance, may com© back into the 
presence of the Father; yet these doctrines are fundamental with the 
Latter-day Saints. No man shall see the kingdom of God unless he 
is willing to accept these truths. 

THE CELESTIAL KINGDOM OF GOD 

I would like to say a word or two in relation to the kingdom of 
God. In the great sermon that was preached by our Redeemer, on the 
mount, He taught the people, as we have already been informed, 
that they should "Seek first the kingdom of God, and His righteous- 
ness," and moreover, that the way was narrow and the gate was 
strait which led to life eternal, and few there were who found it. 
What did he have reference to? To the celestial kingdom. Presi- 
dent Penrose, yesterday, very clearly and properly, pointed out to us, 
through the revelations of the Lord, that it was the purpose of our 
Father, and through the ministration of His Son, our Redeemer, to 
save all mankind, but that must be done through man's agency, 
through his faithfulness, through his obedience to the gospel, and it 
can be done i,n no other way. All men are to be saved, with the 
exception of the sons of perdition, who reject the truth after having 
received it, and who crucify Christ again unto themselves and place 
themselves in such a condition that eternal judgment must be passed 
upon them, of banishment into outer darkness, with the devil and his 
angels. But, in the salvation of the human family, it is contemplated 
that before salvation comes, every knee must bow, and every tongue 
must confess that Jesus is the Christ, and that through the shedding 
of His blood, comes redemption from death and from individual sin. 
Moreover, the Lord has never promised those who enter into the 
telestial kingdom that they shall receive the blessings of exaltation. 
He has not promised to those who enter into the terrestrial kingdom 
a fulness ; but He has declared that he who endures to the end, he 
who will keep all the commandments, he who will be faithful, shall 
find a place in His kingdom; and when He speaks of His kingdom, 
He has reference, not to the great, broad kingdom which will em- 
brace all humanity save the few, who become sons of perdition, but 
speaks of that place where He and His Father dwell. 

Let me repeat, in my own words, however, the expression that 
was made here yesterday by President Penrose. Who, among Lat- 
ter-day Saints, is seeking a place in the telestial kingdom? Who, 
among the Latter-day Saints, is seeking a place in the terrestrial 
kingdom?" With those kingdoms we should want nothing to do; it is 
not the intention of the man who is baptized into the Church, or 
ought not to be, to so live that he will not find a place in the celes- 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 61 



tial kingdom of God ; for baptism, itself, is the way into that king- 
dom. Baptism is of two-fold nature ; primarily for the remission of 
sins, and then, entrance into the kingdom of God, not the telestial 
kingdom, not into the terrestrial kingdom, but entrance into the celes- 
tial kingdom, where God dwells. That is what baptism is for ; that is 
what the gift of the Holy Ghost, by the laying on of hands, is for — ■ 
to prepare us that we may, through obedience, continue on and on, 
keeping the commandments of the Lord, until we shall receive the 
fulness in the celestial kingdom. 

AS TO ADVANCEMENT FROM ONE GLORY 
OR KINGDOM TO ANOTHER 

There has been a great deal of discussion going on in certain 
parts, as to whether or not those of the telestial kingdom may ad- 
vance into the terrestrial, and those of the terrestrial into the celes- 
tial, and whether eventually all men enter into the kingdom where 
God lives and Christ reigns. Why should we worry ourselves? Why 
should we argue ? Why should we contend ? Why should we dis- 
cuss a matter of that kind? When we have come out of the world 
and have received the gospel in its fulness, we are candidates for 
celestial glory; nay, we are more than candidates, if we are faithful, 
for the Lord has given unto us the assurance that through our faith- 
fulness, we shall enter into the celestial kingdom, and surely, no Lat- 
ter-day Saint desires a place somewhere else, there to take a chance of 
some day being forgiven and having the opportunity of advancing 
and finally reaching the place where the righteous dwell. 

Then again, let us keep in mind what the Lord has said; it is 
unnecessary for us to go outside of that which the Lord has stated 
in the revelations unto the Church. He has declared, speaking of 
those who enter into the telestial kingdom, "that where God and 
Christ dwell, they cannot come, worlds without end." Then, why 
should we bother about it ; why should we argue about it ; why should 
we consider these things in such a serious mariner? So far as we 
are concerned let us live so that we will be assured of our pflace, 
and so we will know, through the lives we live, that we shall enter 
into His presence and dwell with Him, receiving the fulness of the 
blessings that have been promised. Who among the Latter-day 
Saints will be content with anything short of the fulness of salvation 
which is promised us ? The revelations are clear ; the Lord has re- 
vealed unto us just what course we should take; He has given us 
commandments ; they are plain ; they can be understood. It does 
not require an interpreter ; he who runs, may read and may under- 
stand and get the knowledge which is essential to his salvation. And 
then of course it is necessary for us, in our humility, and in the spirit 
of repentance, to press on and on; keeping the commandmelnts unto 
the end, for our hope and our goal is eternal life, and that is life in 
the presence of the Father and of the Son ; "And this is life eternal,"

said the Lord, "that they might know thee the only true God, and 
Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent." That we may know this, is my 
prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang, "O ye mountains high." 
The closing prayer was offered by Elder Lewis Anderson, Presi- 
dent of the Manti temple. 

Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock p. m. 



AFTERNOON SESSION 

The meeting began at 2 o'clock p. m., President Heber J. Grant, 
presiding. 

The choir and congregation sang, "O say what is truth?" 
Prayer was offered by Elder James W. Funk. 

The choir and congregation sang, "Though deepening trials throng 
your way." 

ELDER DAVID O. McKAY 

"But if from thence thou shalt seek the Lord thy God, thou shalt find Him, 
if thou seek Him with all thy heart and with a'l thy soul. When thou art in 
tribulation, and all these things are ccme upon thee, even in the latter days, 
if thou turn to the Lord thy God and shalt be obedient unto His voice; (For 
the Lord thy God is a merciful God. He will not forsake thee, -neither destroy 
thee, nor forget the covenant of thy fathers, which he sware unto them." 

At twelve o'clock today I envied the peace to which Brother 
Joseph Fielding was entitled and which I am sure he, enjoyed, after 
his closing address this morning. It is no easy task to anticipate 
facing this audience. 

A VISIT TO DISTANT MISSIONS OF THE CHURCH 

Eighteen months have passed since I had the privilege of trem- 
bling before a congregation in this tabernacle. Twelve months of that 
time have been spent in company with President Hugh J. Cannon in 
visiting the distant missions of the Church. When President Grant 
suggested Brother Cannon as my companion, I readily acquiesced, be- 
cause I knew his worth. Then I respected him ; today I love him. 
I think that conveys to you the fact that our more than twelve months' 
constant companionship, night and day, was most genial and happy. 

NEARNESS OF GOD TO US, AND HIS GUIDING HAND 

I should like very much, this afternoon, to choose some part of 
that wonderful trip and take you over it, but all throughout this con- 
ference I have been prompted to try to give the message that seemed 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY 



63 



to be the most precious to me of all our experiences; namely, the 
many manifestations of the nearness of the Lord and of His guiding 
hand. 

THE MESSAGE 

The message is found in the passage I have read: "If thou turn 
to the Lord Thy God, and shalt be obedient unto His voice, He will 
not forsake thee." I pray that I may be able, in a few words, to 
give that message to the brethren and sisters present this afternoon, 
in the hope that they may convey it to the hosts of young men 
and women who ought to receive, even indirectly, the inspiration of 
this memorable conference. 

A KEEN SENSE OF THE TRAVELER'S RESPONSIBILITY 

When we left home, December 4, 1920, we looked forward with 
no little misgiving and anxiety to the trip ahead of us. It was no 
simple matter to contemplate traveling to the Orient, thence to the 
Antipodes, much of that distance to be spent on the water. The dis- 
tance itself made us realize that we were undertaking a great re- 
sponsibility. Absence from our loved ones was keenly felt by both, 
but greater than these two, and other incidental things that made 
us hesitate about accepting this responsibility, was the realization that 
we were going on a first visitation to our people to represent the gen- 
eral authorities. The keen sense of our responsibility, adequately 
to fulfil the desires of President Grant and his counselors and the 
Twelve, who had honored us with that call, made us seek the Lord 
as I had never sought him before in my life, and I wish to say this 
afternoon that the promise made by Moses to the children of Israel 
just before they crossed the Jordan River into the Promised land, 
has been fulfilled in our experiences. As we sought the Lord with all 
our souls He came to our guidance and assistance. 

TENDENCY OF THE WORLD TO DENY THE EXISTENCE OF A PERSONAL GOD 

It may be that the realization of our dependence upon Him made 
more prominent what seems to me to be a deplorable tendency of the 
world to disregard, even to disown, their relationship to our heavenly 
Father. It was our privilege to hear educators and other prominent 
men speak in different places and upon different occasions, and to 
mingle with different classes of men and women on boats, for we 
spent a total of five months on the water, sailing in about twenty- 
three different vessels, and every vessel well crowded with all classes 
of tourists, most of whom were professed Christians. Frequently 
we were grieved to note the attitude of apology that these Christian 
men and women, assumed toward God, their Creator, and His son 
Jesus Christ. I have been in mixed gatherings here in the State, and 
out of the State, in which some men, when speaking of the early 
pioneers of Utah would refer in a rather apologetic way to Brigham 



64 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Young, and on some occasions I have felt that the speakers even 
hesitated to name him and give him the credit due him in the settle- 
ment of this great intermountain commonwealth, and in the founding 
of institutions that have since hecome centers of influence and might. 
Just such an attitude I have seen manifest among so-called Christians 
when they would begin to talk about God. He did not seem to be 
real to them. He did not seem to be in very deed their Father in 
Heaven. There is a tendency, it seems to me, among Christian nations 
to move toward a conception of God very much similar to the con- 
ception of the Buddhist who says : "There is no personal God-Creator 
on whose mercy and good will the universe is dependent. Every- 
thing owes its origin and development to its own inherent vitalism, 
or, what comes to the same, to its own will to live. Human ignor- 
ance it is which alone invented a personal God-Creator." The Bud- 
dhist utterly rejects the belief in a personal God. So do many in the 
Christian world. In opposition to this false conception of God, I 
wish to declare that today I feel as I have never felt before in all 
my life that God is my Father. He is not just an intangible power, 
a. moral force in the world, but a personal God with creative powers, 
the Governor of the world, the Director of our souls. I would like 
to have the young men of Israel feel so close to Him that they will 
approach Him daily, not in public alone, but in private. 

I would have them have the trust in Him which the little blind 
girl had in her father. She was sitting on his lap in the train, and 
a friend sitting by said : "Let me rest you," and he reached over and 
took the little child on his lap. The father said to her: "Do you 
know who is holding you ?" "No," she replied, "but you do." Oh, 
the trust of that child in her father. She knew she was safe because 
he knew who was holding her. Just so real should be the trust 
which the Latter-day Saint boys and girls have in their Father in 
heaven. 

FOUR GREAT BLESSINGS COMING FROM FAITH IN GOD AND PRAYER 

Like Benjamin Franklin: "The longer I live the more convincing 
proofs I see that God governs in the affairs of men ; and if a sparrow 
cannot fall to the ground unnoticed, is it possible that an empire can 
rise without His aid?" If we can get our young people to have this 
faith and so to approach their God in secret, there are at least 
four great blessings that will come to them here and now. The first 
is gratitude — gratitude for blessings before unrealized. Their souls 
will be filled with thanksgiving for what God has done for them. 
They will find themselves rich in favors bestowed. The young man 
who closes the door behind him,, who draws the curtains, and there 
in silence prepares to plead with God for help, should first pour 
out his soul in gratitude for health, for friends, for loved ones, for 
the gospel, for the manifestations of God's existence, as seen in the 
rocks and the trees and . the stones and the flowers, and all things

about him. He should first count his many blessings, name them one 
by one, and it will surprise him what the Lord has done. 

The second blessing of prayer is guidance. I cannot conceive of 
a young man's going astray who will kneel down by his bedside in the 
morning and pray to God to help him keep himself unspotted from 
the sins of the world. I think that a young girl will not go far 
wrong who will kneel down in the morning and pray that she might 
be kept pure and spotless during the coming day. I cannot think 
that a Latter-day Saint will hold enmity in his heart if he will sin- 
cerely, in secret, pray God to remove from his heart all feelings of 
envy and malice toward any of his fellowmen. Guidance? Yes, God 
will be there to guide and direct him -who "will seek Him in faith 
with all his might and with all his soul." 

The third blessing is confidence. All over this land there are 
thousands and tens of thousands of students who are struggling to 
get an education. Let us teach these students that if they want to 
succeed in their lessons, they should seek their God, that the greatest 
teacher known to the world stands near them to guide them. Once 
the student feels that he can approach the Lord through prayer, the 
student will receive confidence that he can get his lessons, that he 
can write his speech, that he can stand up before his fellow students 
and deliver his message without fear of failure. Confidence comes 
through sincere prayer. 

Finally he will get inspiration. It is not imagination, that we 
can approach God and can receive light and guidance from Him, 
that our minds will be enlightened, our souls thrilled by His Spirit. 
Washington sought it, Abraham Lincoln received it, Joseph Smith 
knew it ; and the testimony, the evidence of the Prophet Joseph's in- 
spiration is manifest to all who will but open their eyes to see and 
their hearts to understand. 

EXAMPLES OF INSPIRATION ENJOYED BY THE TRAVELERS 

Inspiration was given to us on this trip. That is why I touch 
this theme. 

I want to testify to you that God was with us when we stood 
beneath that tree in old China and turned the key for the preaching 
of the gospel in the Chinese realm. My words may not convince you 
of the fact, but no disputant can convince us that our souls were not 
filled to overflowing with the Spirit of God' on that occasion. 

Again the veil was thin between us and departed friends, when 
we stood in prayer on the side of old Haleakala, the largest extinct 
volcano in the world, and poured out thanksgiving to God for what 
He had done for Presidents Joseph F. Smith, George Q. Cannon, 
Elders Francis A. Hammond, James Hawkins and their wives, and 
other missionaries who carried the gospel message to the Hawaiian 
people. 

I knew of His protecting care in the Tongan Islands; for when 



66 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the vessel was submerged by a mountainous wave, we felt that peace 
and security which the little girl felt when she said to her father: 
"No, but you know, and I am safe." 

At Papeete, Tahiti, we knew His guiding hand and acknowledged 
His overruling providence, when replacing our judgment by His in- 
spiration He moved us to do something which our own judgment had 
told us not to do, subsequent events proving that the inspiration came 
in rich abundance in the priesthood meetings with your boys. God 
bless them wherever they are today, for they are God's servants, as 
long as they will keep themselves pure and spotless from the sins 
of the world, and I testify to you that His Spirit is guiding them, 
magnifying them in their youth, making them a power in preaching 
the gospel of Jesus Christ. 

Again, when among the Samoans, we felt His presence on sev- 
eral occasions, especially in that memorable farewell at Sauniatu. 
May I take this occasion to say, brethren and sisters, that we are 
not sufficiently close to the Tahitians, the Maoris, the Tongas, the 
Samoans and the Saints in Australia and New Zealand. In distance 
they are a long way off, and visitations of general authorities are all 
too infrequent. They need things which they do not get — some- 
times, I think, just because of the great intervening distance; but 
their hearts are just as true and genuine and their faith just as sin- 
cere as yours and mine. 

Another memorable example of God's guiding hand was experi- 
enced when we met Joseph Wilford Booth at the very time and place 
that we should have met him in order to make our mission to the 
Armenians successful. He did not know where we were and we 
knew not where he was. He was praying that the hope of President 
Grant, expressed in a letter, might be realized; (for the President 
of the Church, too, was praying that Brother Booth would meet us, 
and that we three would go to Armenia together) ; we were praying 
that we might meet him, so that our mission there would not be a 
failure, and God answered our prayers. If I narrated the details, 
most of you, too, would be convinced that there was some power above 
chance that brought about that meeting. 

RESTORATION OF THE JEWS IN PALESTINE 

Now, I say that one result of approaching God, our Father, is in- 
spiration. Now may I take sufficient time to give one little circum- 
stance in which the inspiration of the Lord to the Prophet Joseph— 
nay more than inspiration, the revelation to the Prophet Joseph was 
fulfilled in part at least, right before our eyes. The same chapter 
from which I read at the opening of my remarks says also that: "If 
they [Israel] depart from the ways of the Lord, and go to worship- 
ing images again, I call heaven and earth to witness against you this 
day, that you shall soon utterly perish from the land whereunto ye 
go over Jordan to possess it. Ye shall not prolong your days upon 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY 



67 



it, but shall utterly be destroyed." "But," says the Prophet, "in the 
latter days, if thou turn to the Lord thy God, and shalt be obedient 
unto his voice, he will not forget the covenant of thy fathers, which 
he swore unto them." You remember also in the Book of Mormon, 
which was published before the organization of the Church, that there 
is a passage referring to the Jews as follows :"Nevertheless, when the 
day cometh that they no more turn aside their hearts from the Holy 
One of Israel, then will He remember the promise He made to their 
fathers." If you will turn to the tenth chapter of Second Nephi, you 
will see what that promise is. "They shall be restored in the flesh, 
upon the earth, unto the lands of their inheritance." And another 
significant remark, that "in that day the Gentiles shall be great in 
mine eyes in carrying them forth to the lands of their inheritance." 
That prophecy revealed to the Prophet Joseph is very significant in 
the light of current events, in the light of the attitude of the Jews 
today toward Christianity, and toward Christ. 

A SIGNIFICANT EXPERIENCE IN JERUSALEM 

All this, however, I must leave by mere reference and carry you 
now to Jerusalem on the 2nd day of November, 1921. On the pre- 
vious day, Jerusalem had been all bustle and business. David Street 
was lined with little shops in which Jews and Mohammedans were 
carrying on their trade. Little donkeys heavily laden with the goods 
of commerce were walking up the rough stone steps of David Street. 
We saw no camels on that street, it being too narrow. Camels were 
lying down depositing their burdens at Damascus Gate. On Novem- 
ber 1, 1921, Jerusalem was a typically busy Oriental city; but on 
the 2nd all things were changed. David Street, so far as business was 
concerned, was quiet. Shop windows were closed, so were the shops 
outside of the wall. By the Allenby Hotel every shop window was 
boarded. No autos stood as usual in front of the hotel ready to 
carry tourists down to the Dead Sea and to Jericho. Our guide, 
Michael, a Greek Christian, seemed to radiate a foreboding feeling. 
I rather jocularly approached him and wondered what was the matter 
with him. He remained silent, his attitude portending evil, and he 
intimated to us to be quiet. We had scarcely reached the Jaffa Gate 
where, by the way, is seen the "eye of the needle," when he broke his 
silence. 

"Don't you see that all business houses are closed?" said he. 
"Yes," I replied, "what does it signify?" 

"It means," he continued, "that today the Mohammedans and 
the Christians are uniting in protest against Mr. Balfour's declara- 
tion that Palestine shall be set aside as a Jewish State." 

Well, it was like a thunderclap from a clear sky. I had not 
dreamed that there would be opposition to that movement. We had 
seen the Jews present in the city carrying on their trade evidently 
in peace, without molestation. We had looked up a few statistics and 



68 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



knew that in 1914 it was estimated that 80,000 people were in Jeru- 
salem ; 50,000 of whom were Jews, most of whom had come there 
but recently ; for fifty years before that there were only 20,000 peo- 
ple in Jerusalem all told. Now to hear from our guide, who seemed 
to know what he was talking" about, that the Mohammedans and 
Christians were opposed to the Jews' coming back, was an astonish- 
ment to me. I haven't time to take you through that day, but I 
just call your attention to this fact, that at eleven o'clock when we 
came back to the street leading to the Jewish quarter, Brother Can- 
non and I expressed a desire to confer with the Jews regarding the 
opposition so strongly manifest that day. 

"Don't go there," cried Michael. 

"Why?" we asked. 

"Because there is danger." 

"No," I replied, "I think there is no danger." 

"If you go there, you go alone," said our guide. 

I said : "All right, Michael, here is where you and we part ' 
company. We will meet you at two o'clock." 

So, alone we went into the Jewish quarter, to hear their side of 
it. We will never forget that scene. Groups of Jews from foreign 
countries, Russia, Rumania, and Orthodox Jews, who had been in 
Jerusalem a number of years talked together in subdued tones. From 
windows and balconies women peered at us, evidently suspicioning 
us as spies — children looking from behind shutters, and doorways. 
We finally found a young Jew who could speak English ; and in 
answer to our question what all this means, he said : 

"The Mohammedans and the Christians are uniting in protest 
against Mr. Balfour's declaration that Palestine shall be set apart as 
a home of the Jews." 

As we walked back, we again passed through a group of Brit- 
ish soldiers in full uniform, including steel helmets, muskets in hand, 
bayonets fixed, guarding the Jews. We knew how necessary their 
presence was; for, as we had come up David Street we had seen 
several Jews and two Jewesses, one of whom clasped a baby to her 
breast, stoned by Mohammedans and so-called Christians, their only 
offense being that they were Jews, who had come back to their 
promised land. 

As we passed these British soldiers, I said : "Boys, we hope you 
will keep them (the Moslems) straight." 

"Oh, I think we can," answered one of the "Tommies" ; and as 
we went back to our hotel we commented upon this scene and the 
significant passage which I have read : "And the Gentiles shall be 
great in mine eyes in restoring them to their land. Yea, the kings 
of the Gentiles shall be nursing fathers unto them, and the queens 
nursing mothers." On the tower that now marks the spot of the 
tower of David, British officers were waving signals over the city, 
giving orders to keep the peace; armored cars, bearing British sol- 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY 



69 



diers were driven through the streets to subdue the threatened up- 
rising. Notwithstanding these precautions, eight men lost their 
lives on the streets of Jerusalem that day. 

At five o'clock the order was given by Acting Governor General 
Samuels, the first Jew to rule in Palestine since before the days of 
the Savior, that no person should be on the street after five o'clock. 
We ventured out after that hour just to see if the order had been 
obeyed. It was, absolutely. We were witnesses that day of the be- 
ginning of the fulfilment of that prophecy which refers to the time, 
now near at hand, when the Jews will "no more turn aside their 
hearts from the Holy One," and when the Gentiles shall be the means 
of restoring them to their own land. 

IF WE ONLY KNEW THE READINESS OF CHRIST TO HELP 

Next day we crossed the Brook Kedron, passed the Garden of 
Gethsemane, and ascended the Mount of Olives, to the spot as near 
as we could determine, where Christ stood when He looked at Jeru- 
salem and wept over her. In the light of the opposition to His pur- 
poses to which we were witnesses, I thought that He would weep 
again if he were standing there today. "If thou hadst known," cried 
he, "even thou, at least in this day, the things which belong unto thy 
peace ! but now they are hid from thine eyes." Neither do they who 
are now opposing his purposes know the things which belong unto 
their peace. "If they only knew!" I desire to say to the children of 
Israel today, in these valleys of the mountains, to the boys and girls 
especially: If you only knew that Christ is ever ready to give you 
help in time of need, and comfort and strength, you would approach 
Him in purity, simplicity, and faith. I indicated in the beginning 
how this might be done. May I illustrate it by a little paragraph 
which I will read in conclusion : 

The builder who first bridged Niagara's gorge, 
Before he swung his cable, shore to shore, 
Sent out, across the gulf, his venturing kite 
Bearing a slender cord for unseen hands 
To grasp upon the further cliff, and draw 
A greater cord, and a greater yet. 
Ti 1 at the last across the chasm swung 
The cable — then a mighty bridge in air ! 
So we may send our little timid thought 
Across the void, out to God's reaching hands — 
Send out our love and faith to thread the deep, 
Thought after thought, until the little cord 
Has greatened to a chain no chance to break, 
And — we are anchored to the Infinite!' 

God bless our youth that they may send out these thoughts in 
prayer and faith and receive the assurance that they are anchored to 
the Infinite, in God our Father and His holy Son, the Redeemer of the 
world. This is my prayer, and I ask it in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE 

They call us "Mormons." The Church to which we belong is 
known as the "Mormon Church." The gospel which is committee} 
to the Church is called "Mormonism." These names, pseudonyms 
as they are, have been fastened' upon us. We do not resent the titles, 
but we must not forget that they are false names, as thus applied. 
Nicknames they were; and where the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints is known in the world to one by its proper name, it 
has been heard of by hundreds as the "Mormon Church." The pos- 
sibility of error, misunderstanding, false conception, through this ap- 
plication of the term "Mormon" should not be forgotten. The Luth- 
eran Church is named after a great man, and those who chose to follow 
his bannner called themselves "Lutherans." So in many other in- 
stances have sects and denominations been named after men ; but 
this is not the Church of Mormon, nor the Church of Joseph Smith, 
nor of Brigham Young, nor of any other man, save only that Man who 
was the Son of the Living God, He who was and is Jesus the Christ. 

WHOSE CHURCH IS IT? 

The compound name-title given to the Church has drawn questions 
and has aroused thought in the minds of those who are not of us : 
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. You will remem- 
ber that after Christ had established his Church among the aboriginal 
peoples of this continent, when he appeared as a resurrected Being 
amongst them, after he had chosen and ordained twelve men to direct 
the affairs of the Church, there was some little disputation as to the 
name the Church should bear, and the Twelve, remembering the Lord's 
gracious promise that when they would call upon him, united in heart 
and purpose, they would be sure of a hearing, fasted and prayed, and 
He appeared again amongst them there in their council meeting in 
bodily presence and asked them what they would. They said, "Lord, 
we will that thou wouldst tell us the name whereby we shall call this 
Church." His answer, as we may render it in modern style of speech, 
was to this effect : Why should there be any question on so simple 
a matter as that? Whose church is it? Is it the church of Moses? 
If so, call it, of course, by the name of Moses; or if it be the church 
of any other man, then call it by his name, but if it be my Church, as ye 
say, and it is, then call it by my name. 

THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS 

When this restored church was organized in 1830, ninety-two 
years ago yesterday, it was named the Church of Jesus Christ ; but 
afterward, by special revelation through the Prophet Joseph Smith, the 
Lord himself gave the extended name and said : "For thus shall my 
Church be called in the last days, even the Church of Jesus Christ 



ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE 



71 



of Latter-day Saints." Many of us content ourselves with the as- 
sumption that this addition was made to avoid confusion with the 
Church of Jesus Christ as it had existed in earlier days, the primitive 
Church as we call it; and I agree with that as being a good purpose 
well served. Nevertheless, to me there is a deeper meaning. This 
is in one sense, and that an all-comprehending sense, the Church of 
Jesus Christ. It was organized by his commandment. Its doctrines 
are his doctrines. The salvation it preaches is the salvation which 
he made possible ; but as an organization among men, as a body of 
human beings it is likewise the Church of the Latter-day Saints, and to 
this body constituting the organization is committed certain authority 
and to such are given certain privileges coupled with commensurate 
responsibilities. It is a self-perpetuating organization, all its affairs 
being carried on by men who are duly called under the inspiration or 
by direct revelation from the Lord who stands at its head. 

PRONE TO USE "MORMON" TOO FREELY 

The Church, therefore, is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints ; and while I say we do not resent the term "Mormon," I am 
inclined to think that we Latter-day Saints, as we call ourselves, and 
rightly too, are prone to use the term "Mormon" a little too freely. 
I have been impressed by comments made to me, orally and by letter, 
by men of thought, theologians and scripture students, telling of the 
impression made upon them when they first considered the name 
"The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints" and expressing 
surprise that we use the term "Mormon" among ourselves, as we do, 
so freely. I have thought of this matter many times, extending 
through many years, but "Mormon" is a common name with us. If we 
will only remember that it is used because others know us thereby and 
because it is shorter, and because we are used to it, there may be no 
reason for strong objection; and there is a little excuse, perhaps, if not 
of justicifation, for I remember that the Lord has made plain that the 
holy Priesthood, which we are told is after the order of the Son of God, 
has been and is called the Melchizedek, Priesthood to avoid the too fre- 
quent repetition of the sacred Name, and I would rather hear the 
Church spoken of as the "Mormon Church" if we understand the sense 
in which the term is used, than to hear the name of Jesus Christ used 
loosely, or with contempt, and perhaps with feelings that are even 
more sinful. 

ATTEMPTS OF SMALL SECTS TO USE NICKNAME 

By the way, now that the term "Mormon," thus fastened upon 
us, has become commonly current, I note that because of the esteem 
in which the Church is held by many who know us as we are and 
yet are not of us, attempts have been made by certain small sects to 



72 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



claim it. You know there are a number of small, aberrant, and ab- 
normal denominations who profess to believe in this little thing that 
the Prophet Joseph said or did, or to accept that part of the 
revelations which God gave to him though they reject many 
of the revelations from the Lord given through that same prophet, 
and in years past they have made manifest their detestation, of the 
term "Mormon." Their advertisements in the papers used to be 
coupled with an explanatory line "Not Mormon," and now I think* 
1 am not saying too much when I affirm that they are trying to purloin 
that nickname and apply it to themselves. They want to be called 
"Mormons." But the world who gave us the nickname have given 
ns letters patent assuring our right, our exclusive right to it. Whether 
we want to use it or not is another matter. 

THE REAL MEANING OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS 

But I pray you consider wriat the real name means — "The Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints." We can understand, easily, 
what "Latter-day" means — modern day, this day ; but what does the 
word "Saint" mean? By derivation, by acceptation, and by the best 
authority in the language, it means directly, used as an adjective, 
"holy," and when used as a noun, "a holy one ;" and we, therefore, 
profess to be a body of holy men, holy women. We proclaim our- 
selves in the name otf Jesus Christ to be the holy ones of the last 
days, a significant proclamation, blasphemous in the extreme if it be 
not justified. But that name was given us of God. We do not 
apologize for it, nor do we preach the doctrines of the gospel, com- 
mitted to the Church to ibe preached, in any apologetic manner. We 
preach in simplicity, in humility, but not by way of apology. I agree, 
from my own observation, with the attitude assumed by many, re- 
ferred to and described so tersely by Elder McKay. We have no 
apology to offer for our name nor for our membership in the Church, 
nor for our scriptures that have been given by revelation through the 
prophets of the Lord unto the people. 

What should it mean to you and me, to be thus called a holy; 
man, a holy woman ? As thus applied, the t'erm does not mean that 
the one who bears it is necessarily without weakness or devoid of 
blemish. An authorized; usage of the term "holy" is that it shall apply 
to anyone or anything that is authoritatively appointed and set apart 
for exclusive service in the cause of God, and such we profess to be, 
set apart amongst men and nations as the people of God. However, 
all peoples and all nations may be one with us and m&y thus be s'et 
apart, if they only will, and so become entitled' to bear that distinguish- 
ing name. 

GREAT POWER IN CHURCH REGARDLESS OF NUMBER 

There is power in a name given of God, and there is power in 



ELDER JAMES E. T ALU AGE 



73 



this Church. You know it, we all know it, though our numbers be 
few. One of our speakers referred to the total membership of the 
Church as constituting a handful as compared with the people of the 
world, the human population at this time. The expression was apt; 
but I pray you let us not forget that the Lord does not reckon strength 
in terms of the numbers of men. You know a certain king of old, 
the king of Israel, was rebuked because he wanted to number Israel 
and find out over how many people he ruled. Why should he not 
have known that though they were one one-thousandth part as many 
as he hoped, with the Lord on their side they could vanquish the 
world, if so directed. The success of this Church, as an organization 
among men, does not depend wholly upon numbers. 

ILLUSTRATIONS 

Let me illustrate, showing that other people recognize the fact. 
Some time ago it was my privilege to be in consultation with a man 
of letters, who was a directing editor of two large newspapers in 
Boston. He inquired into some phases of our Church history, asked 
me many questions in an investigative manner, and be put this in- 
quiry to me : "What is the membership of your Church ?" This was 
long ago, a few years ago, before the last census was taken. I said : 
"Approximately five hundred thousand." "Oh," he said, "I don't mean 
here in New England, or in this section only. I want the total mem- 
bership." "I have told you, sir." He leaned back in his chair; then 
he said, "Do you tell me, in all earnestness, that the great "Mormon" 
Church numbers only approximately half a million?" "I do." Again 
he leaned back and, after a moment's thought, rose as the Spirit of 
the Lord gave him utterance, and bore testimony to the power of God 
in these simple words : "Surely, the hand of God is in it." 

We are not a big Church, but we are a great one — the greatest 
on the face of the earth. I say it without apology, without qualifi- 
cation. Between bigness and greatness there is a fundamental differ- 
ence. 

Again, in the city of Baltimore I was once talking with the 
editor of one of the leading papers. I had been announced to speak 
in the city. He explained to me — this was during the war season — 
that space was precious in their papers, that the force of reporters 
had been cut down, and perhaps they could not cover the meeting 
as they would otherwise have been pleased to do. In a casual way he 
said : "Flow many have you in your congregation here in Baltimore ?" 
I was able to answer him promptly and accurately, for shortly before 
my interview with him I had been in consultation with the conference 
president. I gave the number — as I remember it, it was twenty-nine. 
"Twenty-nine," I replied. He started in his chair — "Twenty-nine 
what?" "Twenty-nine souls," said I, "most of them children." He 
said : "Are you in earnest ? Are they all you have ?" I said, "Yes ;

and if you wish I can give you the names and the addresses. We) have 
the complete roll and record of our members here." His answer was : 
"We will send a, reporter. You shall have all the space you want." 

NOT DISAPPOINTED IN SMALL NUMBERS 

Do you see, that such men recognize the fact that there is some- 
thing more in the Church than mere numbers? I call to mind the 
prediction of the ancient Nephite prophet — no, the prediction of the 
living God, given through his prophet, that in these days, in the very 
dispensation in which this book, the Book of Mormon, should come 
forth out of the earth, the Church of the Lamb should be found 
in many lands, all over the earth, but that their numbers would be 
few ; so we are not disappointed. We expect to be few ; for, of the 
whole human family there are few who are willing to recognize the 
truth, very few. I read with deep emotion that declaration recorded 
in the seventy-sixth section of the Doctrine and Covenants that the 
inhabitants of the Telestial world, kingdom or glory, whichever you 
like, the lowest of the kingdoms of glory, were seen to be as in- 
numerable as the stars in heaven or the grains of sand upon the sea- 
shore. We are started on the high journey along that straight and 
narrow path that has been referred to, leading to the Celestial king- 
dom of the Lord our God. Let us sanctify ourselves, as becomes holy 
ones, that there be no blemish upon our sacred name and title. I 
pray in the name of Him who gave the Church its designation, the 
Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

A REVOLTING CRIME 

Two months ago a prominent business man of this city sat in 
his home, eating his evening meal, with his family surrounding him. 
Without warning, there entered his home two masked men. Upon 
their entrance they commanded him to raise his hands, and there- 
after, immediately, this man was shot to death. The crime cast a 
pall of horror and of gloom over this entire community. 

CRITICISM OF THE POLICE OFFICERS AND THE LAW 

Following the first effects there came a reaction in the form of 
indignation and rather severe criticism of the municipal and police 
authorities for the crime which had been committed. A delegation 
of business men, representative of clubs and associations to which 
the deceased belonged, waited upon the police and civic departments 
of the city, voicing something in the nature of criticism for what was 
alleged to be inefficiency on the part of that department and its 
inability to forestall such terrible disasters as that which bad 



ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 



75 



happened. Among the criticisms that were urged at the time was 
this one : It was said the police department had given over so much 
of its time and endeavor to the attempted enforcement of laws which 
were in their nature quasi-moral regulations that it was unable to 
throw the whole force of its power into . measures and safe- 
guards tending to mitigate and to forestall the commission of crime. 
Not very complimentary things were said at the time regarding the 
class of legislation which the police department had, in some measure, 
attempted to enforce. Among these laws which were held up to ridi- 
cule by the men who felt so aggrieved, was the law passed by the last 
legislature of this state against the sale and disposition of cigarettes, 
and the smoking of tobacco under certain proscribed conditions, 
Other laws came in for a share of condemnation, and it was said 
that altogether too much of the efforts put forth by the police de- 
partment had gone to the enforcement of laws against gambling, 
against (he keeping open of places of ill repute, and other measures 
tending to regulate society in this community. 

OTHER CAUSES THAN THE POLICE AT FAULT 

Shortly after these criticisms were urged against the police de- 
partment of this city certain developments came to light in the hor- 
rible crime which had been committeed. It was at first supposed that 
the crime had been perpetrated by masked bandits, probably 
strangers to the city, in the hope of procuring goods and wealth from 
the home of him who had been shot. It later developed that the 
whole tragedy had its inception in the plan of a young girl who 
had been retained in the household as a servant; and according to 
the confession which she made, as it was set forth in the press, it 
seems that her ideas were formulated largely from the education — I 
use the word advisedly — which she had received in the moving pic- 
ture halls of this city. You are all more or less acquainted with the 
details of her confession. You know what importance she attached 
to the fact that she had conjured up in her own mind a tragedy in 
which she should play a very important part and possibly secure some 
coveted notoriety. Further investigation and development also 
brought to light the fact that one of the principals in the murder 
was the son of a widow whose husband was murdered several 
years ago ; that he came from a broken home, and that by reason of 
the inability of a poor mother to properly provide that training and 
those safeguards which should be around the life of every young 
man, he had been subjected to improper influences, had given him- 
self over to association with bad characters and thus came to this 
lamentable end. The antecedents of the other principal do not seem 
to be so well known. I think, however, it would be a safe estimate 
that he likewise had come from a home which had not exerted around 
him that influence which is designed to safeguard him from the temp- 
tations of the world. The point that I desire to bring to your atten- 



76 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



tion in again reminding you of the circumstances attendant upon this 
tragedy is this, that the very thing against which the legislation which 
is so bitterly complained of was directed, an|d the very things 
against which it and similar legislation were provided as safeguards, 
are the things which gave rise to this unspeakable tragedy. 

THE REAL CAUSE 

The lack of moral culture, the failure to supply the innocent or 
unfortunate with the safeguards that should be about them in youth 
had given rise and stimulation to ideas and false notions which resulted 
in that terrible crime. The men who voiced their disapproval, not 
only of the laws passed by the legislature but of the enforcement of 
those laws by the civic authorities of this city surely must have felt 
that they were mistaken when they urged that criticism against our 
municipal authorities. 

AN APPEAL TO SUSTAIN THE LAW AND ITS OFFICERS 

I want to appeal for co-operation and support for the municipal 
authorities of our cities and towns in the enforcement of that legis- 
lation which is somewhat paternal, which has for its object the safe- 
guarding of society even though it may not be entirely in consonance 
with the belief of many men and women as to the proper and legiti- 
mate function of the government. Every good citizen knows that when 
the legislature passes a law, that action ends discussion as to whether 
or not the principle is a right or proper one for legislation, at least 
until such time as an issue shall be formulated upon the question 
again. The legislature of this State and the legislatures of some 
other states have passed laws tending to safeguard the moral, the 
physical, the spiritual well-being of the citizens of this and other 
slates. It ill becomes any citizen, surely it is ill becoming in any 
member of the Church, to interpose any degree of criticism, at this 
stage either upon the wisdom of the legislation or the propriety of en- 
forcing the law. 

It is not an easy thing to enforce law. My sympathy goes out 
to the men who have been elected to positions of responsibility and 
who are called upon to bring to justice those who violate the laws 
and the ordinances of the land. I believe that never, at any time in 
our history, has there been greater need for whole-souled support 
of the administrators of law than at the . present time. It, is re- 
gretable in the utmost degree that there are citizens of this country, 
as pointed out by President Ivins in his remarkable address of yes- 
terday, who are inclined to look with very great allowance upon the 
infraction of those ordinances and laws which are passed tending to 
bring about better conditions in our state, and surely it must follow 
that if we neglect the enforcement of these laws there will come a 
degree of crime and infraction of law that will be horrible to all the 
people and to all the world. I believe that the time, has come when 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN

we must stand by the laws of the State, when we must support these 
regulations, and we must lend such co-operation to our municipal 
authorities that they will feel and know that the best people of the 
country stand squarely behind them. Not only is it our duty as a 
Church to lend influence and support in this measure and in these 
particulars, but it is likewise our duty to so use these great organiza- 
tions which the Lord has given to us that they may educate boys and 
girls in respect for law and for order. I believe thoroughly that 
the firmest props to our government lie in religion and morality. 

OUR NEED OF FAITH, SERVICE AND SELF-CONTROL 

A memorable address was made at the university, upon the in- 
auguration of its new president, by Doctor Carver, who addressed this 
conference, upon the pertinent question : "How much civilization can 
we stand?" He answered his question by saying in substance: "We 
can stand only so much civilization as we may show service and 
self-control." Religion, true religion, faith in God the Father, adher- 
ence to His commandments and to the principles of truth, are in- 
dispensable to the development of self-control and to the development 
of that great altruistic spirit which shall render service to humanity 
and to God. Therefore, I appeal to my brethren and sisters who 
officer and direct these great organizations of the Church, to so use 
them that they may stimulate and establish faith in the hearts of 
boys and girls and men and women. The Church is not an end in 
and of itself. The Church is but a great implement to be used by 
these holy ones, of whom Brother Talmage has spoken, for the en- 
lightenment of the world, for the reclamation of the souls of' men and 
for the establishment in the hearts of men of the great virtues which 
go to make character and manhood and womanhood. God grant that the 
people of the Church may support and sustain the law, the adminis- 
trators of the law, and the foundation of the law, which lies in the 
great principles of truth, virtue, equity and justice, I humbly pray in 
the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 

As a result of the promise and resolution I made in our General 
Conference six months ago, I am standing before you this afternoon 
in what is probably the largest pair of shoes ever made at Z. C. M. I. 
And who can say that the making of this suit of mine, of Provo-made 
cloth, has not so increased the demand for wool that its price has ad- 
vanced from something like fourteen cents, six months ago, to some- 
thing like thirty-five cents now. 

OUR MISSIONARIES HAVE A NOTABLE MESSAGE 

President Grant read a statement yesterday from Prest. Nicholas 
Murray Butler of Columbia University that it is significant that in this 



78 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



period of vigorous and able-bodied reaction the world should be "without 
a poet, without a philosopher, and without a notable religious leader. 
The great voices of the spirit are all stilled just now, while the mad 
passion for gain and for power endeavors to gratify itself through the 
odd service of destroying what has already been gained or accom- 
plished." 

While our missionaries as individuals may not be regarded as 
"notable religious leaders," by the great mass of people in the world, 
they do speak with authority and they do have a message for the world 
that to them is of such importance that they are willing, at their own 
expense, to give their time and devote themselves thus unselfishly to 
carrying the gospel message "to every nation, kindred, tongue and 
people." 

Sooner or later the world will learn that in these days the heavens 
have been opened, God the Father has spoken, the Son has appeared, 
the gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored, and it is being preached "as 
a witness" and that when this message has been carried to "every 
nation, kindred, tongue and people" our Lord and Master will come 
rgain in accordance with prophecies clearly made in Holv Writ. 

THE GREATEST NEED OF THE WORLD TODAY 

The greatest need of the world today is the return to simple 
Christian religious ideals. One of the world's greatest financial sta- 
tisticians ( Roger W. Babson, Fundamentals of Prosperity, p. 55) has 
stated the situation clearly in. the following words: 

"Much of the prosperity of this nation is due to the family prayers which 
were o'nce he'd daily in the homes of our fathers. Tg a very large extent this 
custom has gone by. Whatever the arguments pro and con may be, the fact 
neverthelesss remains that such family prayers nurtured and developed these 
spiritual resources to which the prosperity of the nation is due. The custom 
of family prayers should be revived along with many other good New England 
customs which some modern radicals may ridicule, but to which they owe all 
that they possess." 

HOW THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS MAY PERFORM THEIR TASK 

The work that has been given us to do, that of preaching the gospel 
to all the world, is a tremendous undertaking. This work can be ac- 
complished only if we, the members of the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints, live in fairly strict conformity with the teachings 
of the gospel of our Master. Of these teachings there is none more 
thoroughly fundamental and important, perhaps, than that of family 
prayer. Are the fathers and mothers of the Church devoting them- 
selves faithfully to this important duty, and are they teaching their 
sons and daughters to place their trust in Divine Providence? 

If it were possible for me to do so, I should be glad, this after- 
noon, to teach you some sure method of making money, to teach you 
how to save money, to teach you some method of going forward with 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 



79 



certainty to secure honor, to secure distinction, to accomplish some 
unusual or tremendous success. But giving such instruction would 
not be of greatest importance, for the accomplishments I have named 
are not in and of themselves the greatest of the fundamentals. 

That Scripture quoted yesterday by President Charles W. Penrose 
and this morning by Brother George Albert Smith, is founded upon 
the essential fundamentals. We must, if we are to achieve the greatest 
success, "seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness," then 
all these things will be added unto us. 

PRAYER ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTALS OF SUCCESS 

The forefathers, the founders of our country, sought first the 
kingdom of God. This great nation of ours is builded upon a religious 
spirit. Our forefathers were religious men. Washington, Franklin, 
Lincoln — these great Americans were all prayerful. The great leaders 
of our country all the way along the line have been men who were 
firm believers in, and who placed their confidence in, Almighty God. 

The wise men of the world seem these days to be pretty well 
agreed that in all time the peoples of the world have been in no 
more serious situation than they are today. 

Lincoln's proclamation for a day of prayer 

For Lincoln's time the situation faced was a serious one. What 
he did then ought the world not to do now ? In what was probably the 
darkest hour of the Civil War, he set apart March the 30th, 1863, as 
a day of fasting and prayer by issuing a proclamation which read in 
part as follows : 

"Whereas, the Senate of the United States, devoutedly recognizing the 
supreme authority and just government of Almighty God in all the affairs of 
men and nations; has by a resolution requested' the President to designate 
and set apart a day for national prayer and humiliation ; and 

"Whereas, it \s the duty of nations as well as of men to own their 
dependence upon the overruling power of God, to confess their sins and trans- 
gressions in humbled sorrow, yet with assured hope that genuine repentance 
will lead to mercy and pardon, and to recognize the sublime truth, announced 
in the Holy Scriptures and proven by all history, that those nations only are 
blessed whose God is the Lord : 

"And, insomuch as we know that by His divine law, nations, like individ- 
uals, are subjected to punishments and chastisement in this world, may we not 
justly fear that the awful calamity of civil war which now desolates the land 
may be but a punishment inflicted upon us for our presumptuous sins, to the 
needful end of our national reformation as a whole people? We have been 
recipients of the choicest bounties of Heaven ; we have been preserved these 
many years in peace and prosperity; we have grown in numbers, wealth, and 
power as no other nation has ever grown But we have forgotten God. We 
have forgotten the gracious hand which preserved us in peace and multiplied 
and enriched and strengthened us, and we have vainly imagined, in the deceit- 
fulness of our hearts, that all these blessings were produced by some superior 
wisdom and virtue of our own. Intoxicated with unbroken success, we have 



80 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



become too self-sufficient to feel the necessity of redeeming and preserving 
grace, too proud to pray to the God that made us. 

"It behooves us, then, to humble ourselves before the offended power, to 
confess our national sins and to pray for clemdicy and forgiveness 

-"This fasting and praying being done in sincerity and truth, let us then 
rest humbly in the hope authorized by the divine teachings that the united cry 
of the nation will be heard on high aind answered with blessing no less than 
the pardon of our national sins and the restoration of our now divided and 
suffering country to its former happy condition of unity and peace." 

TEACH THE YOUNG PEOPLE TO PRAY 

To the last degree I am interested in the welfare of this people. 
The ambition of my life is to use my physical strength and mental 
power for the good of the young people in the Church. I want them 
to succeed. May heaven help us to induce them to live in accordance 
with the principles of the gospel. I desire 1 them to have eyes that are 
brighter, intellects that are clearer, minds that are more active than 
are the minds and intellects and the vision of other people. These 
blessings must be ours if we, the people of the Church, though few in 
numbers, are to accomplish so much. 

If there is before me now any father or any mother who has not 
taught his or her son, his or her daughter, to lead in family prayer 
I beg of you, accept my sympathy. Teach them to pray. 

Only last Tuesday a mission president reported that when he 
called upon a young man to lead in family prayer, who had come into 
the mission field, the young man hesitated, stumbled, uttered but a few 
words, finally finished in considerable embarrassment and then said : 
"That is the first time in my life I have spoken a word of prayer." 

SEEK FIRST THE KINGDOM OF GOD 

Let us, I beg of you, remember the Lord, "Seek ye first the king- 
dom," and all these things shall be added unto us. 

Our obligation to train our children as they ought to be trained 
is an important one. While "We believe the Bible to De the word oi 
God," we believe that what is written in the Doctrine and Covenants, 
and what is recorded in the Book of Mormon, applies with a greater 
degree of accuracy to us in these days and in this age than does that 
which is recorded in the Bible. I shall read to you now Scripture from 
the sixty-eighth Section of the Doctrine and Covenants beginning with 
the twenty-fifth verse. This scripture is intended for us here and now : 

"And again, inasmuch as parents have children in Zion, or in any of her 
stakes which are organized, that teach them not to understand the doctrine of 
repentance, faith in Christ the Son of the living God, and of baptism ;<nd the 
gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands when eight years old, the sin 
be upon the heads of the parents ; 

"For this shall be a law unto the inhabitants of Zion, or in any of her 
stakes which are organized : 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 



81 



"And their children shall be baptized for the remission of their sins when 
eight years old, and receive the laying on of the hands. 

"And they shall also teach their children to pray and to walk uprightly 
before the Lord. 

"And the inhabitants of Zion shall also observe the Sabbath day — "And 
the inhabitants of Zion shall, also, remember their labors, inasmuch as they are 
appointed to la,bor in all faithfulness, for the idler shall be had in rememberance 
before the Lord. 

"Now, I the Lord, am not well pleased with the inhabitants of Zion, for 
there are idlers among them; and their children are also growing up in wicked- 
nss ; they also seek not earnestly the riches of eternity, but their eyes are full 
of greediness. 

"These things ought not to be, and must be done away from among them." 

Let us, then, primarily seek not honor, nor position, nor money, 
not social standing, but let us seek first the kingdom of God and His 
righteousness and then incidentally all these very desirable things will 
follow. 

May the Lord bless us to this end I humbly pray, in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang, "Come let us anew our jour- 
ney pursue." 

Benediction was pronounced by Elder Wm. W. Seegmiller, Presi- 
dent of the Kanab stake of Zion. 

Conference adjourned until 10 o'clock Sunday morning, notice be- 
ing given that a general Priesthood meeting would be held this eve- 
ning; and that a special Priesthood meeting would be held on Satur- 
day morning at 10 o'clock. 



THIRD DAY 



The Conference met on Sunday morning, April 9, at 10 o'clock ; 
all the seats being occupied, as well as the aisles, where many stood 
during the services, and hundreds by the doors unable to gain admission. 
There was, besides, a crowded overflow meeting in the Assembly Hall. 

President Heber J. Grant presided and announced the opening 
hymn. 

The choir and congregation sang, "The Spirit of God like a fire 
is burning." 

Prayer was offered by Elder Edward H. Anderson, of the presi- 
dency of the Granite stake of Zion. 

The choir sang the hymn, "Hail ! bright millennial day of rest." 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

ANNOUNCING A MEETING OF TWO AND ONE HALF HOURS 

This is certainly a very wonderful audience for such a stormy 
day. We feel grateful because of the desire on the part of the Latter- 
day Saints to attend their meetings — that we have this wonderful 
audience. If a person has a journey of two hundred miles to travel, 
and, at the end of that time, finds that he must go another fifty, it 
makes him very tired indeed, but if he starts out for two hundred 
fifty miles to begin with, he is not weary or worn out when he ar- 
rives at the end. Usually, we are here two hours but we are going 
to make it two and a-half today.' T thought if I gave you fair notice, 
you would not be so fidgety as you otherwise would. 

ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 

I wish to read from the 52nd chapter of Isaiah beginning with 
the 7th verse : 

"How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bnngeth 
good tidings, that publisbeth peace ; that bringeth good tidings of good, that 
pubhsheth salvation; thii, saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth. 

"Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice ; with the voice together shall they 
sing ; for they shall see eye to eye, when the Lord shall bring again Zion. 

"Break forth into joy, sing together, ye waste places of Jerusalem ; for 
the Lord hath comforted His people, He hath redeemed Jerusalem. 

'1 he Lord hath made bare His holy arm in the eyes of all the nations ; 
and all the ends ot the earth shall see the salvation of our God." 

WHAT OF THE DAY AND HOUR IN WHICH WE LIVE? 

I rejoice, my brethren and sisters, to belong to a Church that has 
watchmen, who sing together in unison, who indeed have the vision, 
the light, and the inspiration of the living God, to direct this people. 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 



83 



When the people come together, as we do on these great occasions, 
there may be in the hearts of many, the cry, "Watchman, what of 
the night, and what of the hour, and what of the day in which we 
live?" 

But that cry is not made in vain. The hour, the times, and the 
seasons in which we live, are known and have been revealed during 
the sessions of this conference, to the Latter-day Saints. We are not 
groping in the dark, and we live in the day that Isaiah was talking 
about when, upon tbe mountains of Ephraim, where we stand, the 
watchmen shall sing together in unity ; the day when the waste places 
shall be redeemed ; and Jerusalem, as we heard at this conference, 
stands on the threshold of her redemption, for the Lord hath decreed 
it. 

A PEOPLE WITH A GREAT MISSION 

I rejoice, I say, to live and to be identified and associated with 
a people who have the great mission that has been committed to the 
Latter-day Saints. I rejoice, with my brethren, in the thoughts ex- 
pressed by the distinguished gentlemen, who spoke to us following the 
remarkable address of the chief watchman upon the towers of Zion, 
our president. I thought that Professor Carver might have referred 
to what he has written with reference to the Latter-day Saints. He 
s'ated, in our hearing, that he thought this was one of the most fruitful 
fields in the world to study those who were dealing with great em- 
pire building questions. He wrote, two years ago, in a preface to a 
book published by Professor Warren H. Wilson of Harvard, entitled 
Evolution of the Country Community, deploring the tendency on the 
part of the majority of the people of this country to move from 
the rural communities and the small towrts into the larger cities. He 
commented upon the exceptions to this general rule, and he found the 
exceptions among the "Mormon" people. He has been here ; he has 
studied us. It is not only considered a fruitful field by him upon 
the occasion of this visit, his attention has been upon it a long time, 
or he would not have said what I now quote from his introductory 
chapter : 

"The elements of permanent cultivation of the soil are found in greater 
niimber among the 'Mormons' " — [You will note he mentions them first] — 
"Scotch, Irish. Presbyterians, and Pennsylvania Germans, who are the best 
American agriculturists." 

A PEOPLE WHO MAINTAIN SELF-CONTROL 

Professor Wilson said in his book, in a later chapter, "The 
'Mormons' represent in the highest degree, these exceptional farm 
communities in the United States. Perhaps no other so large or pow- 
erful a body of united farmers is found in the whole country." Then 
I thought of something Professor Carver said in that very excellent 
work he has published, entitled, The Religion Worth Having. He 
asks the question: "What is the best religion," and answers it in 



84 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



these words : "The best religion is, first, that which acts most power- 
fully as a spur to energy ; and second, directs that energy most pro- 
ductively." I was thinking upon these utterances of the distinguished 
gentleman, who was a visitor and a speaker at this conference, and 
in connection with his very remarkable address which I was privi- 
leged to hear at the University the other day, in which he summed up 
his whole answer to the question, "How much civilization can we 
stand?" He said: "The answer is found in our ability to maintain 
self-control." When I think of these questions, and; khe sugges- 
tion in his message, I ask: "Where in all the earth, could he or any 
other man go to find a people who maintain more self-control than 
the Latter-day Saints? 

RULES OF CONDUCT BROAD AND COMPREHENSIVE 

I tell you when God laid the foundation of this Church, He 
gave us the principles and rule of conduct for the membership of 
this Church, so broad, so complete and comprehensive, that upon that 
foundation we can build to attain heights that men never have at- 
tained in the history of this world. We are here for that purpose; 
we are here to produce the highest civilization that has ever graced 
the foot-stool of God. 

THE DESTINY OF THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS THEIR DUTY 

IN REACHING IT 

If this people will listen to the voice of the watchmen, who, in 
the days that are past, have successfully piloted this people to their 
present state of efficiency, on the farm, in their commercial relations, 
in the family institutions, and in the morals of the people, I testify to 
you there will be no disappointment. Every principle by which these 
problems may be solved has been delivered to this people. We did 
not come here to be imitators. If there is anything good or praise- 
worthy, we seek after these things, but we are not here to be lured 
from the great goal and end, which is to build up the most perfect 
race of people that have lived, and they will not be perfected by 
talking about it. We will attain that end when we can maintain full 
self-control. When I listened to those stirring words from President 
Ivins relative to the conditions that obtain in the world, indicating 
that even in our own blessed land, there is a loss of 'self-control ; that 
men are not willing to abide by the constitutional law of the land; 
when I listened also to the statement quoted from a distinguished 
senator to the effect that there are no interests in this country now 
that are not bound up together for selfish purposes, I wonder if we 
are not approaching the day prophesied of in olden times, both upon 
the eastern and the western continent, and again uttered in this dis- 
pensation, through the Prophet Joseph Smith, to the effect that men 
would be bound in bundles ; and when the time cometh that they 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 



85 



are bound in bundles, they are ready for the burning; they are ready 
for destruction. 

THE DANGER OF SELFISHNESS AND CLASS COMBINATIONS 

I plead with you now, my brethren and sisters, that we shall not 
fall into the ways of the world in being bound into selfish bundles. 
Every organization and institution that promotes the welfare of one 
particular class against the welfare and interest of others, is dangerous ; 
any institution, I care not what its name may be, that makes you con- 
cerned only in your own particular group of workers, promotes 
selfishness. Unions have never found very much favor in this 
Church; not because we do not like to see our brethren of one par- 
ticular profession or group affiliated together, but we see the dan- 
ger of the system, the plan and the purpose of it, which is selfish- 
ness, wherein the man within the union or combination is at enmity 
with his brother, who is out of the organization. There ought to 
be, therefore, no feeling tO' find fault with the leaders of this Church, 
who have given counsel and advice to our brethren, with respect to 
this matter because they see dangers that we can not see. The ap- 
peal to selfishness is dangerous, and there never was a period in 
the world's history when it was more rampant than it is today. We 
talk about the time when the Redeemer of the world shall come, when 
peace shall be in the earth, when we shall enjoy universal brother- 
hood. But outside of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints, it seems to me, there never was a period, in modern days 
at least, when there was less universal brotherhrood than there is to- 
day, and more selfishness displayed than -ever before. But you 
brethren, sixty thousand of you, who have filled missions, who left 
your homes, paid your way, to preach this gospel to strangers, what 
was your training? It was a training in universal brotherhood. It 
shows that we love our brothers and sisters in other parts of the 
world, sufficiently, that we not only pray for them but we spend our 
good means and time to bring them salvation. 

THE LAW OF TITHING A REMEDY FOR SELFISHNESS 

The law of tithing which has been revealed to this people makes 
for the destruction of selfishness, and for the establishment of uni- 
versal brotherhood. And how much that is needed now, when we 
think that a half-million people in this country today are on strike 
because of the warfare between capital and labor, wherein the coun- 
try itself, is in danger and in peril, and the whole world is in dis- 
tress because of the conflict between capital and labor. I have reached 
the conclusion that the Lord knew the needs of our times when he 
gave to the Prophet Joseph Smith the law of tithing. And prior 
to that, he gave him the law of consecration, a plan by which, in the 
days of Enoch, men had all things in common ; there were no rich 
and no poor among them. Our people were willing to go forward 



86 



GEXERAL CONFERENCE. 



and enter into that order, but they were not prepared, they lacked 
training, they lacked preparation, and the Lord gave the law of tith- 
ing in his own words, "as a schoolmaster," to bring us to the higher 
law. I want to tell you that the day of graduation from that school 
is coming, but it will not come by a little group going off here, and 
another there, to undertake to precede the Church. It will come 
when God inspires His prophet to step forward and speak the word, 
and many men and women will be prepared for graduation, to enter 
into those principles that are altogether righteous, that God has de- 
creed must be established when the Son of God comes to reign and 
rule among men upon the earth. They will come from that school, 
and be the men and women who have paid their honest tithing, and 
those who have not, will be ready to go back in the primer class and 
start all over. How many are prepared to do greater things ? Flow 
well have we attended school ? I appeal to you now, at this time, when 
men are tempted, because of their financial circumstances, because 
of their distress and inability to pay their obligations, perhaps, to 
depart from the commandment of the Lord, and deny Him that which 
belongs to Him. I say to you, my brethren and sisters — I know it, 
in the very depths of my heart ; I know it, and I say it to you. As 
the Lord lives, if this people will pay their honest tithing and prac- 
tice economy, as suggested by the President of this Church, you will 
meet your debts and your obligations and be free. I promise you that 
if we will keep the commandments of the Lord, we will never lack 
means to the accomplishment of the purposes which he has in store 
for us, if we will use the material things as but a means to a glorious 
end. 

HOW THIS PEOPLE HAVE LEARNED OBEDIENCE AND SELF-CONTROL 

I said that we are men and women who have learned self-con- 
trol. We have learned it in the payment of tithing ; we have learned 
it in obeying the laws of the land. One of the things that men are 
now deploring is the tendency upon the part of the people, even of 
our own country, to disregard and disobey the laws of the land. I 
hold up to the Latter-day Saints and to the world the example of this 
Church, in obeying the law as an evidence of our superior ability in 
self-control. 

President Ivins called our attention to those experiences through 
which we passed in the days of President Woodruff, when we re- 
signed the practice of a principle that God had revealed, when we 
gave it up. What for? In order to obey the law of the land. It 
produced hardship, heart-ache, sorrow and distress. Men had shown 
their devotion to that principle and had suffered bonds and imprison- 
ment, but in order that we might be a law-abiding people, honoring 
and obeying and sustaining the law, we surrendered it, no matter 
what it cost ; the practice of it we gave up, and I hold it before 
the people of this country as an evidence of the ability of the 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD

''Mormon" people to honor and to obey the law. Let us not forget 
it, Latter-day Saints, that there is a duty incumbent upon us, to con- 
tinue, to set a law abiding example. The Lord said (you will find 
it recorded in the 115th Section of the book of Dbctrine and Coven- 
ants) that he called upon the Church to come out of the world and 
to lift up an ensign to the nations. That is what we are here for, 
to show them the way. 

TO REACH THE GOAL WE MUST PAY THE PRICE OF MORAL INTEGRITY 

I speak now of another principle involving the same question. 
No people ever shall reach the heights except they are pure in heart. 
There is coming from abroad, reaching us in some form or another, 
and it will continue to come, the demoralizing influences that are in 
the world ; that have broken down the moral standards of the nations 
of the earth. I care not what they say against us in England. They 
are saying that we have selected handsome boys to go to England just 
now, when there are two million more women in England than men. 
to lure the women and girls of England to come over here for im- 
moral purposes. As Sir Phillip Gibbs said to us privately, in com- 
menting upon it, "You would not need to send boys over to England 
to do that, particularly handsome boys ; if you would just put a little 
advertisement in the paper that you would pay their fare you would 
get a boat-load a week." Let them say what they please in England 
or anywhere else. I care not what they say ; but what I am concerned 
in is what we do. All the world may condemn us and count us as 
the scum of the earth, impure and unclean, but that will not 
keep us down, nor deter us from reaching the heights. On the other 
hand, all the world may speak well of us and praise us and give us 
credit for being a virtuous people, and if we are not, we cannot rise, 
by all the plaudits of the world. So, the secret of our attaining the 
goal is to pay the price of moral integrity. We must maintain the 
standard that has been exalted for this people. I have heard it, as 
you have. From the clays of my boyhood, I was taught by my mother 
to live as clean and as chaste and as pure as the girl I asked to be my 
wife, the mother of my children. It has been taught by this Church, 
that next to murder itself, is the crime of sexual impurity. Jesus 
said, discussing the question of the morals of men, "He that looketh 
upon a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery already with 
her in his heart." In these last days he has said that he that looketh 
upon a woman to lust after her and does not repent, shall deny the 
faith. There never was an immoral people who did not entertain 
immoral thoughts. I believe this generation excels all others 
in doing this wicked thing and we are encouraged by reason of the 
dress and deportment of women, innocently, sometimes, perhaps, and 
yet in others, deliberately to attract the attention and make the sexual 
appeal. They deport themselves in such a manner that their very ap- 
pearance is suggestive to impure and unclean thoughts. The depict- 



88 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ing of the sex stories that we now often see upon the "Movie" 
screen, tends in the same direction, and I could mention other things. 

APPEAL TO YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN TO 
MAINTAIN OUR MORAL STANDARDS 

Now, I say to you, daughters of Israel, do not fall into the 
snares of the world. It is incumbent upon you, not only to preserve 
yourself, but to save your brothers. If the young men of this Church 
do not keep themselves clean, woe, woe unto the daughters of Israel ! 
You, young men, it is incumbent upon you to preserve our standards ; 
to preserve the moral integrity of the daughters of Israel; and re- 
member that next to murder itself, is the crime of sexual impurity. 
Let that be burned into our hearts and our souls, and we will weather 
the storms that beat upon us. 

PARENTS SPIOULD ASSUME MORE RESPONSIBILITY 

Then, parents, let us assume a little more responsibility ; do not 
take too much for granted. I have said to my own sons and daughters. 
; "It isn't that I do not trust you and have confidence in you, but 
I know the temptations of the hour ; I am not going to let you stand 
alone ; I am going to keep a little closer to you than I have ever done 
before. Too many courtships are going on in automobiles, instead 
of next door where father and mother are within the home. I am 
appealing to you, my brothers and sisters, that we shall not follow 
these alluring things, because they are deceptive. 

A CALL TO REPENTANCE 

I say to you that the civilization of this world has reached its 
pinnacle. Except it shall repent and serve God, there will never be 
any greater civilization in this world than there is today. They can- 
not go higher, because their foundation is not solid. They have not 
learned self-control. We who have set out upon a great task of 
doing things, that never have been done, let us remember the lessons 
we are to learn; and if we adhere to these things, we shall "go over 
the top ;" we shall attain the heights. May God help us to get clearly 
in our mind the vision of what we are called to do and the ambition 
to do it, by individually maintaining control, while chaos shall reign 
out there. Do you know what is coming? Oh, my heart is sick 
when I see what is coming in the world. Do you want to know what 
it is? You read what happened when Rome became immoral and de- 
generate; you read what happened on this land of America when 
the Lamanite and the Nephites became degenerate. Kings will be 
murdered upon their thrones, bands of men with common interest 
shall seize the government for a moment, to be overthrown by other 
combinations of interest ; property will be unsafe ; law will be mocked 
at, and the rule that will obtain is the rule of self-interest and selfish- 
ness, except men shall repent. 



ELDER HYRUM G. SMITH

A VISION FOR ZION 

But, I see something different for Zion. I see her rise and shine 
in glory and power and might, because she has the truth, if she will 
only treasure it and live up to it. The day will come when people 
shall come from the east and the west, and the north and the south, 
and say, "Come, let us go up to the mountain of the house of the God 
of Jacob, that there we may learn to walk in her paths." and so, we 
shall attract not only them but we shall attract the angels of God and 
bring to live upon the earth again, among men, the Lord Jesus 
Christ. We can speed that day, for he is waiting upon us. Let us 
rouse ourselves, and go forth from this conference with a determina- 
tion that, better than ever, we will adhere to the standards of Zion, I 
pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

ELDER HYRUM G. SMITH 

(Presiding Patriarch of the Church.') 

In my memory I go back ten years ago from this Conference. I 
was not present, however, but I suppose a great many of you were 
here when the opportunity came for you to raise your hands in vote 
to sustain the patriarch of the Church. You sustained a man you 
did not know, and whom many of you had never seen. Today, I am 
grateful for the testimony which has been strengthened in me, es- 
pecially during the past ten years. It seems only a clay, in one sense, 
since that Sabbath day — the 6th of April 1912 — when, as a branch 
president, seven hundred miles from here, I had entered upon my 
duty as a humble elder in the Church, while the great multitude of 
Saints who had gathered here in this building, raised their hands to 
sustain me as the Patriarch of the Church. 

The Lord has blessed me in my ministry and, before you, my 
brethren and sisters, I wish to acknowledge the hand of God in his 
blessings unto me. and unto this people. I have observed that during 
my tenure of office many important changes have taken place in the 
growth of the Church. Many of its leading men and women have fin-- 
ished their earthly missions and are separated from us. I have seen 
the workings of the Church here at home, in the stakes and wards of 
Zion, and in the mission fields, and I see the Church going on in growth, 
in keeping with the wonderful teachings which you have just listened 
to, in obedience to the true law of Christ, the love of our fellows, liv- 
ing the pure laws of life, which have been revealed from heaven from 
our Father and our Redeemer. I not only see the work of the Lord 
progressing here at home, in the wards and stakes of Zion, but I 
see the honest in heart of the world being brought out of the world, 
through obedience to the teachings of humble elders and the mission- 
aries in general, both men and women, throughout the world, in the 
missions that have been organized by the Church. I see today that 
the missions are gradually partaking of the nature of stakes. Further 



90 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



organization and growth will go forth to gather out the honest in 
heart and those who are willing to take upon them the name of Christ 
and enter into these holy alliances for the establishment and growth 
of truth and righteousness in the world. This work has been organ- 
ized and given to the earth, never more to be thrown down nor given 
to another people. It has been given for a purpose, and the Lord 
will, in his own due time and way, see to it that that purpose will be 
accomplished and fulfilled. The responsibility is upon us today. God 
grant that we may have the power, the courage of our convictions, to 
stand by our standards, and be equal to the responsibilities given us. 
I pray that God will bless and sustain those whom He has called to 
preside in the Church — our President — the First Presidency, and all 
associated in this great work, both directly and indirectly, whether 
called to labor at home or abroad. With all the power that the Lord 
has given me, my heart goes out in blessings to those who are in 
the Church today and those who are willing to come in, in 
the proper way, that we may all rally together and work together for 
the standards of truth and virtue, even in the face of evil witnesses, 
who decry us as untrue and false. 

I suppose there will always be someone to rise up in the world 
to testify against the work of the Lord, but He will triumph in the 
end; and in the present time, the great responsibility of carrying orf 
His work is given to us — the great multitude that is assisting to bring 
about the blessings which were pronounced upon the head of Ephraim 
the son of Joseph, to fulfil the blessings of Joseph, who was separated 
from his brethren, and became a savior unto his people, are being ful- 
filled today in our very lives. We are the nation today that should 
preside and become established in the tops of the mountains, even in 
the utmost bounds of the everlasting hills, where that great salvation 
for all the world should be established, where not only the house of 
Abraham and Isaac and Jacob should be established, and saved, but 
where all of God's chosen children should receive their blessings — 
and they shall receive them at the hands of Ephraim. 

Therefore, my brethren and sisters, as kinsmen in the house of 
Joseph, descendants of his chosen son, let us be true to our birth- 
right — valiant workers in this great cause of righteousness and be 
prepared to administer the promised blessings. 

We were admonished by the President of the Church in repeat- 
ing that great truth that is revealed to us, that all of our blessings are 
predicated upon obedience. No matter how great or how small the 
blessing we desire, we must first learn the law upon which that blessing 
is predicated, and then, in obedience to that law, we must work for 
our blessings. If we are to share in this great work and officiate in 
turning the keys for the blessing of all mankind, of every kindred, 
tongue and nation, we must learn the law and we must obey it. We 
must receive our blessings first, else we cannot share them with our 
fellows. 



ELDER SEYMOUR B. YOUNG

In the name of the Lord, I pray that the blessings of our Father 
in heaven may be upon this people, and upon all those who are called 
to preside and lead in their midst ; that we may get the blessings which 
our Father has provided for us ; that we may stand true and firm in 
the faith; that we may live virtuous lives as sons and daughters of 
God, and be worthy to administer the promised blessings to the world, as 
the people come out, cleansing themselves from the sins of the world 
and espousing the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. There are in 
the Church, as it is organized today, over two hundred patriarchs 
bearing the holy Priesthood, with power to administer blessings unto 
the faithful members of the Church. I pray God to bless and magni- 
fy them, that they may honor that great gift of pronouncing blessings 
upon the people. God bless us all. in our homes, in our fields and 
places of business, bless our labors both temporal and spiritual, and 
bless those who befriend us at home and abroad, in the name of the 
Lord, Jesus Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT SEYMOUR B. YOUNG 

{President of the First Council of Seventy.) 

My brothers and sisters : I trust that I shall be able to make you 
hear some of the remarks that I shall make, if not all. 

On the 30th day of June, 1843, it is recorded that the Prophet 
Joseph Smith was a prisoner in the hands of Mr. Reynolds, a sheriff 
from Missouri, who had endeavored to carry him away, across the. 
border of the state of Illinois, into Missouri, that they might there 
destroy his life. I believe that was their intention, and I believe 
that he was impressed with that thought, for he says, on this occa- 
sion : "I was a prisoner in the hands of Reynolds, the agent of 
Missouri, and Wilson, his assistant. They were prisoners in the hands 
of Sheriff Campbell who had delivered the whole of us into the hands 
of Stephen L. Markham." By the way, Brother Markham was a per- 
sonal friend, and faithful follower, of the Prophet Joseph Smith, so 
that the prophet expressed himself as full of joy and rejoicing that 
he was once more in the hands of his friends. 

Years after the Saints had left the city of Nauvoo, in company 
with my wife I visited the great exposition of the western states 
and of the Union Pacific Railroad combined, held in Omaha, Nebras- 
ka. After the exposition had received our attention and we had vis- 
ited as long" as we desired, we took a journey down to the city of 
Nauvoo. I found the city of Nauvoo consisted of about eight hun- 
dred inhabitants, and they had removed the city from the banks of the 
Mississippi river, and from the homes surrounding the mansion house 
and dwelling place of the Prophet Joseph Smith, up on to higher 
ground and further out on to the prairie, making a new town or a 
new city, as they claimed. The walls of the temple had also been 
taken down and removed, stone by stone, and much of that material 



92 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



composing the lime-rock walls, was taken and builded into a school 
house, just east and north of where the temple stood. A few of the 
marked stones in the temple — the union, clasping of the hands, and 
the faces representing- different individuals or different scenes in the 
history of creation were still held by private individuals, as stones 
representing a curious condition or time of the building of the temple 
by the Saints in Nauvoo. They were retained as a matter of curios- 
ity; not that they had any veneration for these building stones that 
became so sacred in the walls of the temple of the Saints. 

We visited the Mansion House also. A Mr. Sells was in 
possession of it, a young German and his wife. They had gone there 
because they could rent the place, with an acre of land containing an 
orchard, for the small sum of $50 a year ; and so, we found them liv- 
ing in the old home of the Prophet. After it became time for us to 
depart and close our visit with this very interesting young couple, I 
asked the privilege of remaining in the mansion house over night 
and sleeping in one of the rooms where the Prophet once dwelt. 
My wish was readily granted and they prepared a bed for us in the 
reception room, on the east side of the hall. 

[ make mention of this matter to you because my feelings were 
very much wrought up during this visit, and I had deep sympathy, 
in memory of the suffering of those martyrs, of their imprisonment 
and their final murder by an armed mob in Carthage jail, and the 
grief that came over the people at the time of their burial when their 
remains were taken from the funeral services and deposited in the 
earth. I remember very well the feelings of veneration that came 
over me that morning ; and a new love and a new light seemed to 
dawn in my heart, in realizing that I had come to view and had been 
permitted to see the blood-stains of the martyrs that were left at the 
time they lay in that sacred room. 

I remember very well the first time that I ever beheld the Prophet 
Joseph Smith. He sat upon his horse, "Old Charley," as he affec- 
tionately called his saddle-horse, a very fine specimen of a messenger 
horse, dark in color, with a white stripe in his face ; and as I saw 
him sitting upon this noble animal, dressed in his full uniform, as 
Lieutenant-General of the Nauvoo Legion, at the head of that Le- 
gion, in the Spring of the year 1842, as the rank and file were on 
parade in their uniforms, marching to and fro on a prairie lot, ad- 
joining the farm owned by the Prophet Joseph, the sight of the 
Prophet at this time made a lasting impression upon my mind, that 
never has been erased. I felt that I was looking upon the 
greatest man that I had ever seen, and truly his appearance was 
prepossessing, dressed in his full uniform of the State Militia, as 
commanding general of the Nauvoo Legion, this military organization 
composed of Latter-day Saints entirely. I remember often seeing the 
Prophet after this occasion, and every time that I saw him, I was 
more and more impressed with the sacredness of his calling, with the 



ELDER SEYMOUR B. YOUNG 



93 



nobility of his manhood, and in lesser degree with the great work 
that he was establishing for the benefit of human kind. On this 
morning, that I mentioned in the beginning of my remarks (see Vol. 
V., History of the Church, pp. 459-475), he expressed his joy and 
satisfaction that he was once more at liberty, freed from the hands 
of his enemies and among his own people again. He was met on this 
occasion at the outskirts of the city by his brother Hyrum and by his 
wife, Emma, in company with many of the leading citizens of Han- 
cock county, escorted to his home again, on the 30th day of June, 1843. 

The impressions of his greatness, of his prophetic ministry, that 
I received, although but a small boy, only six years of age, I never 
have forgotten. On the morning of June 23, 1844, he passed our little 
dwelling, riding along the road known as Mulholland Street, to- 
ward the town of Carthage, in company with his brother Hyrum and 
some ten or fifteen brethren, members of the Church, who were ac- 
companying him on his way to Carthage. On the steps of our little 
dwelling, some few rods away from Mulholland Street, with my 
mother and her four children, I saw them pass. My mother pointed 
to the company as they passed plainly in our sight, and said, "Chil- 
dren, there go the Prophet Joseph and his brother Hyrum, on their 
way to Carthage," and she added. "1 fear they are going to their 
martyrdom." Those words impressed me with a deep meaning of 
sorrow, for they were prophetic indeed. 

On the 28th day of June, at 5 o'clock, about day light in the 
morning, Jacob Gates, our near neighbor, came to our door and 
rapped upon it, and said: "Sister Jane, are you awake?" addressing 
my mother. He would have said "Brother Joseph, are you awake," 
but my father was on a mission to the eastern states at the time. So 
my mother answered and said, "Yes, Brother Gates," and I never shall 
forget the startled tone in which she asked the question : "What is 
it ?" Brother Gates replied : "The Prophet Joseph and his brother 
Hyrum were murdered in Carthage jail last night at 5 o'clock." I 
never remember of referring to this matter directly, and talking it 
over with my mother, but the memory of her words and the memory 
of the visit of Brother Gates and the statement that he made con- 
cerning the martyrdom of the Prophet and Patriarch of the Church 
comes up before me, and it has never left me, and the recognition 
that I felt in my very soul of the greatness of that man, so far as I 
could comprehend it, have never been separated from my memory 
from that time to the present. 

I rejoice with you today, my brothers and sisters, that I have 
a testimony of the life and labors, acceptable to the Lord, of this 
great man, that he was indeed the Prophet and revelator, the seer 
of the fulness of times, bringing to earth again for the acceptance of 
mankind, the gospel of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, organiz- 
ing the Church under the inspiration that God had given unto him, 
with all its officers complete, and the quorums of the priesthood, all 
put in perfect order, organized before his martyrdom. He seemed 



94 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



never satisfied to rest from his labors until every quorum of the 
priesthood was represented in the organization of the Church. 

In 1834, a company under his direction, went up to the State of 
Missouri to see what could be done in replacing the Saints again 
in possession of their homes, from which they had been driven in 
Missouri, and particularly in the town of Independence. This visit 
was made, and the company making it was styled "Zion's Camp." 
How much they accomplished, the Lord only knows, and the good 
that they did, He knows also, for he directed and led the company 
and piloted them until their safe return, most of them, back to their 
homes, in fulfilment of the promise made by the Prophet Joseph to 
his brethren. 

The quorum of the Twelve apostles was organized the following 
spring, and the quorum of Seventies, all of which evidenced the de- 
termination of the Prophet to complete the organization of the 
Church. He had been warned, as he declared, that his life would not 
be prolonged, only until time had been given him to finish his work, 
which the Lord had assigned him. 

I testify to you today, my brothers and sisters, with what little 
experience I have had in the Church for lo, these eighty years or 
more ; I say I know that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, the Savior 
of the world, and that Joseph Smith was indeed a prophet of the 
living God, and that he has accomplished the purposes and the work 
assigned to him, organizing the Church of Jesus Christ once more 
upon the earth, and I am happy to say that I have a testimony with- 
in my heart today that I am a member of that Church. 

May the Lord bless us all and help us to be faithful and true, I 
pray, through Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen. 

A sacred solo, "The mighty Lord hath spoken," was sung by Mrs. 
Laurinda Brewerton. 

ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 

At this moment I sympathize very heartily with the remark made 
by Dr. Carver last Thursday, as I left him at the Tabernacle door, "I 
have heard of many ways by which a man may lose his breath, but I 
know now that the most effective method is to speak before a General 
Conference meeting in the Salt Lake Tabernacle." Nevertheless, my 
brethren and sisters, I am glad to bear to you my testimony of the con- 
viction in my heart that this is the work of God. 

THERE IS A SPIRIT IN MAN 

Surely every person in this vast congregation, who has tasted of 
the gospel of Jesus Christ, can testify that the words spoken during this 
conference, have been uttered by the inspiration of God, and not of man. 
The Lord has made His servants mighty and strong. "There is a 



ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 



95 



spirit in man, and the inspiration of the Almighty gives them under- 
standing." 

I rejoice to know that, if I obey the commandments of God and live 
in accordance with my best knowledge of His law, when great things 
are required of me, I may, with confidence, draw upon the power of 
God, to secure the assistance I need. 

MATERIAL HYPOTHESES DO NOT EXPLAIN THE WORLD 

As I have listened with great interest to the addresses made at 
this Conference, from the remarkable key-note address given by orn 
beloved president, to the last address made, I have been reminded over 
and over again, of the sober words spoken by one of America's 
greatest chemists, who died only about two months ago. This man 
was a discoverer of two of the chemical elements. He had made many 
other notable contributions to human welfare. Sometime before his 
death, he gave himself to the study of the purification of 'ether, with a 
view of making it more serviceable in the surgeon's operating room. 
A short time before he died, Dr. Baskerville, who was both a great 
chemist and humanitarian, in conversation with some of his friends, 
reviewed the great advances in knowledge during his life and the 
peculiarly intimate knowledge that he had gained of his own field in 
science. In summing up the results of his life's labor, he declared 
that "There is something which cannot be explained on a purely materi- 
alistic hypothesis." This man, standing at the pinacle of scientific 
knowledge — in the full light of man-made knowledge — declared' 
soberly to his friends that w'ith all the knowledge he had 
won in the laboratories and from books, he was constrained 
to say that his knowledge was incomplete, that there is a spiritual some- 
thing which must be taken into account, even in the domain of science. 
This declaration of a modern scientist is the age-old and eternal wail 
of the baffled soul, which, rich in man-made knowledge, stands helpless 
by an impenetrable wall which only spiritual truth can open or move 
away. His declaration is also the great cry of faith for man, when he 
discovers his limitations and learns to understand the value and power 
of faith, cries out, "There is something in the world which cannot be 
explained on a purely materialistic hypothesis." 

THE EXPLANATION OF EXPLANATIONS 

Ever since the beginning of time, men have sought for an explan- 
ation of the universe. Facts are merely the building blocks of -truth ; 
they have no value in themselves ; but when facts are placed in conjj unc- 
tion with each other, in an organized form in the service of gneat ex- 
planations, they leap into life and attain meaning. The world moves 
on, not by the discovery of facts, but by the explanation of the facts 
that men secure ; and the most rapid way of discovering new truth is to 
win the great explanations that make coherent the innumerable facts 
of the universe. 



96 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



It is instinctive in the human soul to seek for the greatest of all 
explanations — the explanation of human existence. The questions : 
Whence comes man? What is his purpose here? What will he do 
hereafter? are the natural questions of every human being who thinks 
about the things about him. Poets and philosophers, from the begin- 
ning of time, have attempted to answer these fundamental questions, 
and thereby give satisfaction to the human soul. Nations have become 
great, or have remained small ; have impressed themselves greatly or 
poorly upon the course of human history, as they have been able, 
in a greater or in a smaller degree, to answer these fundamental ques- 
tions regarding human existence, and to train the people in this knowl- 
edge. A nation with a purposeless philosophy of man's existence has 
never served the world greatly. 

It is the glory of this Church that it possesses, and the glory of the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, that he left behind him, for us and for all 
generations to come, the explanation of explanations, the reason for 
life and reason for human existence. Under the inspiration of God, 
he told us whence we came, what we are doing here and where we are to 
go. This knowledge is a glorious heritage. We lived before this 
life; we were in the beginning with our Father, our God. We were 
begotten by Him, as President Penrose declared last Thursday. In tha. 
preexistent life, we made a preparation and laid a foundation on which 
we are building today : we won our right, as Elder Talmage said, to 
come forth upon this earth, to do our work. We shall live hereafter — ■ 
not a quiet, silent, purposeless life, but a life of development and pro- 
gress, everlastingly achieving, everlastingly growing,-; everlastingly 
becoming more and more like the greatest and highest of our ideals. 
Around such an explanation of life may be clustered in orderly fashion 
all the events of existence. It was such an explanation, I think, that 
our friend Dr. Baskerville had in mind when, a few month ago, he 
spoke the sober words I have quoted relative to the achievements of 
his life. 

ALL ACTS MUST HAVE SPIRITUAL MEANING 

I would like to leave as one of the thoughts, and perhaps the main 
thought, of the few moments I have at my disposal, with this vast 
assemblage of people, that the all-important thing in life, after all, is to 
find a place in the universal scheme of things, for all the acts of our 
lives. There is a Spiritual meaning of all human acts and earthly events. 
The Lord has specifically declared "not at any time have I given unto 
you a law which was temporal." It is the business of man to find the 
spiritual meaning of earthly things. I pay my tithing, for many reasons, 
perhaps, but the one great reason is that by so doing, I am advancing 
this great cause, this great purpose, this great plan to which I am com- 
mitted. I keep the Word of Wisdom to keep my body clean and pure 
and wholesome, but I keep the Word of Wisdom also, because by so 
doinb I make myself an abler colaborer with God in carrying onward 



ELDER JOHN A. W1DTS0E 



97 



this great work. I grow sugar beets, not merely becajuse I want clothing 
and food for my family, but because the cultivation of the soil and the 
consequent increased prosperity among the people, adds to the onward 
progress and nearer fulfilment of the purposes of Almighty God, of 
the great explanation of explanations, beginning in tine vast Before 
and ending in the vast Hereafter. No man is quite so happy, I think, 
as he who backs all his labors by such a spiritual interpretation and 
understanding of the acts of his life. A piece of silver always has a 
certain value as it passes from hand to hand ; it is weighed and we sell it 
in the market place ; but, when that piece of silver is coined into a 
dollar, it receives the stamp of government service ; it becomes a coin of 
the realm, and it moves from hand to hand to accomplish the work of 
the realm. So, every act of man, the moment it is fitted into the great 
plan, the plan of salvation, receives spiritual coinage, and passes from 
hand to hand, from mind to mind, to accomplish the great work of God. 
It is a great theme beyond my powers to develop fully, and far beyond 
the time at my disposal ; but I desire to leave with you as my testimony, 
the thought that the greatness of life is won only when men regulate 
and order the affairs and acts of their lives by an understanding of the 
great spiritual purpose of man's existence. Those who do not so place 
their lives, who act because of selfish purposes, independently of the 
great plan, are as the purblind; they stand in the midst of knowledge 
and light, yet they do not see. In times of material difficulty, like these, 
it is more important than ever to hold to the spiritual significance of life 
and to obey the spiritual law. 

OUR TEMPLES PLACES FOR SPIRITUAL INSPIRATION 

We have on every hand in this Church many opportunities for 
gaining the great spiritual knowledge and strength with which we may 
surround and interpret all the acts of our lives. Every principle, every 
part of the organization of this Church, lends itself to the spiritual 
strengthening and iup-building of our lives. 

Temple work, for example, gives a wonderful opportunity for 
keeping alive our spiritual knowledge and strength. We believe that 
those who die without the faith, may be served by us, as proxies, in the 
holy temples ; and that these dead, because of our unselfish labors, may 
be able to secure blessings, somewhat similar to those that we desire 
for ourselves. Thus, by serving the dead, we commit ourselves defi- 1 
nitely to the great eternal plan of human salvation, which constitutes 
the spiritual basis of all life. The past, the present and the future are 
united by our vicarious acts. The mighty perspective of eternity is 
unraveled before us in the holy temples ; we see time from its infinite 
beginning to its endless end ; and the drama of eternal life is unfolded 
before us. Then I see more clearly my place amidst the things of the 
universe, my place among the purposes of God; I am better able to 
place myself where I belong, and I am better able to value and to weigh.

to separate and to organize the common, ordinary duties of my life, so 
that the little things shall not oppress me or take away my vision of 
the greater things that God has given us. 

TEMPLE WORK A SIGN OF THE LAST DAYS 

My brethren and sisters, we belong to the last days, in this last 
great dispensation, which has unfolded the great explanations of life. God 
has said that this people is to prepare for the last days. The last days 
will come ; there will be a time when this work shall be accomplished, 
and a new work undertaken. One of the great purposes of this Church 
is to prepare for the last days. There shall be signs of the last days ; 
there shall be things that will tell us when the last days are about to 
occur and when they are here. May I say to you that we need not go 
far away to look for these signs ; they are about us. I know of no more 
convincing sign of the approaching end than the work now being done 
in our temples. I heard Elder George F. Richards, president of the 
Salt Lake Temple, say, a short time ago, that five or six times as 
many endowments are now being done daily in the Salt Lake Temple 
as were done a few years ago. This is a sign of the last days. When 
the hearts of the fathers and the hearts of the children, living and dead, 
are tied together in love, and in recognition of God's great purposes 
for the human family, then the Lord has found a people which may 
prepare properly for the last great coming of the Savior and the 
purification of all things, and the re-establishment of the true kingdom 
of God. 

God bless us, that in all we do, in our labors in the home and the 
field, or wherever we may be, we may understand the spiritual mean- 
ing and value of the things we do ; that we may go through life with 
seeing eyes, finding light even in the darkness of earth, I ask in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang, "O say, what is Truth ?" 

ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS 

(Of the First Council of Seventy) 

I have recently returned from attending the National Council 
of the Boy Scouts of America, held in the city of Chicago, on the 
29th and 30th of March. As our Church is very much interested in 
the Boy Scout movement, I have thought that perhaps the best 
contribution I could make to our conference, would be to report some 
things connnected with the National Council proceedings. 

It so happened that the Sunday before going east to attend this 
conference, I delivered, in this Tabernacle, a discourse on the subjects 
that have been dwelt upon, more or less, by the speakers in this con- 
ference; namely, the wave of lawlessness which seems to be sweep-

ing over our land. It was, therefore, somewhat refreshing, to get 
connected up with a movement, and obtain a vision of the other side 
of the picture that represents our country — the good side. If we at- 
tend solely to observation and the summing up of evil alone, we are 
very apt to get a mis-vision of things. Truth is knowledge of things 
as they are — not as they are in wrong vision of them, but as they 
are in reality. And so, attendance upon this National Council of 
the Boy Scouts of America gave me an opportunity to get a vision 
of some of those progressive things that are being done in our land, 
that make for good citizenship, for moral worth, for spiritual uplift, 
and I feel very grateful for that view of the things which came to 
me by reason of my connection with this national council. 

There were in attendance at this council about two hundred men, 
representing the finest citizenship of our land, men interested in 
the future welfare of our country. They came from New England, 
from the Atlantic Coast states, and from the Gulf coast states, and 
from the great Middlewest. They were a fine representative body of 
American men interested in more than eight millions of the youth 
of our land within the Scout age, the age from 12 tO' 18, 

It was reported by those having this work in hand, that we had 
enlisted in this great cause of citizen development of our youth, about 
530,000 men and boys, 403,000 of them being enrolled scouts. Plans 
were adopted by the National Council, looking to the complete oc- 
cupancy of the whole territory of our country, by which all the youth 
of our land would be brought within the territorial organization of 
this great movement. It was recognized that what had been done 
was but little in comparison with what remains to be done. It is im- 
portant, of course, that more than five hundred thousand men and 
boys are enlisted in this cause, but it is of still greater importance 
that plans should be adopted for reaching the eight millions of lads 
within the scout age and not yet enrolled in scouting. This body of 
men from all parts of the country were made up from among the 
leading citizens of the various districts they represented. And not 
only did they represent the organizations directly interested in this 
movement, but also those organizations which indirectly are inter- 
esting themselves in it, and giving it financial and moral support. 
There was spoken of there the business men's organizations through- 
out the land, that are interesting themselves in this movement; the 
Kiwanis clubs were mentioned; and the Rotary clubs, and "The 
Lions," an organization of business men's societies — all these were 
represented as playing the part of the "big brother" to the Boy Scout 
movement, in many localities. The financial aid and moral support 
that these business men's organizations are giving to the Boy Scout 
movement convince me that the reputation America has for being 
materialistic in spirit, and selfishly money-mad, isn't altogether true, 
since so many organizations of business men are interesting themselves 
in a movement that is so purely unselfish, and that has for its pur-

pose the moral uplift of the present boyhood of America, in order 
to provide for the future good citizenship of our country. 

America, notwithstanding the present reign of lawlessness, which 
we all deplore, is not all bad. There is a great volume of good in it, 
and those prophecies of evil that we have in the scriptures that have 
been given to our Church respecting our country — the United States 
— while they sound a note of warning against lawlessness and the 
evil conditions that now obtain, yet they also carry with them an al- 
ternative, to the effect that if the people of our country will repent 
and respect the conditions of righteousness, which God requires of 
any people that inhabit this God-blessed land of America, then He will 
not destroy them, but will secure them, in the enjoyment of their 
rights and of their liberties. His blessings will attend them, and 
they will become a mighty instrument in His hands for good ; and 
He will couple their destiny with the destiny of modern Israel, until 
the Zion of God shall be founded upon this land which is "choice 
above all other lands." I have been thinking of late that if I were a 
younger man, I would be disposed to consecrate all the years of my 
life in sounding that warning to our American people, to outline 
for them, as God has outlined it in our scriptures, the glory, and 
honor, and power, and influence, and world-leadership that God is 
willing to confer upon this mighty people of America, and upon their 
government that He has brought forth through the inspiration of His 
Spirit, upon the minds of the fathers of the republic, who laid deep 
and well the foundations of human liberty by creating and adopting 
the constitution of our country. I would be willing to devote my life 
to that, I say, to the saving of the manhood and womanhood of Amer- 
ica ; and get that manhood and womanhood consecrated to the accom- 
plishment of God's high purposes with reference to our land. 

What I now want to do, however, and more especially, is to 
awaken your interest in this Boy Scout movement. You do not 
know how proud I was to have it said that our state of Utah held 
the record for the highest percentage of enrollment of Boy Scouts of 
America ; that in this state we had registered one in ten ; whereas, in 
other states the nearest number approaching that is about one in 
thirteen. This gives evidence of larger interest in boy scouting in 
Utah than elsewhere. 

Now, what I want to do in these few minutes in which I am to 
address you is to awaken a universal interest in this Boy Scout 
movement. We have gathered here in this meeting, representatives 
from all sections of the territory occupied by the Church of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints, not alone from Utah, but from surrounding states. 
I would like, if I could do so, to send you all home enthusiastic in 
this cause. I would be delighted if all our bishops could go from here 
determined to give full recognition and encouragement to this move- 
ment, until what has become a mission with the General Board of 
Y. M. M. I. A., which, as you know, is assuming the role of "Big

Brother" to boy scouting; I would like to have you officers of the 
Church, everywhere, give welcome to the promotion of this organi- 
zation, and I am sure that you will be inclined to do that if only once 
the great purpose to be achieved through this organization is carried 
home to your hearts. To accomplish that desire I am going to repeat 
to you, but only in "head-lines," the purposes of this great organi- 
zation, to which our Church has given official recognition and en- 
couragement ; and which our Young Men's Mutual Improvement As- 
sociation has taken under its wing, for the purpose of helping it de- 
velop and achieve its highest purposes. "The Scout Promise" — 
sometimes called, "The Scout Oath," is: 

1. On my honor I will do my best to do my duty to God, and 
my country, and to obey the scout law. 

2. To help other people at all times. 

3. To keep myself physically strong, mentally awake, and mor- 
ally straight. 

What a foundation is here ! All that these apostles, with the 
spirit of their apostleship upon them, have urged and asked for with 
reference to our labors among our youth, is pretty well covered by 
this solemn promise that the boy gives upon entering into scouting. 

The further aim of scouting is set forth in the scout law, which 
requires that the scout shall be trustworthy, that he will be loyal, 
that he will be helpful, that he will be friendly, that he will be cour- 
teous, that he will be kind, that he will be obedient, that he will be 
cheerful, that he will be thrifty, that he will be brave, that he will be 
clean, that he will be reverent. What more could be required of 
boydom than that? 

Fathers and mothers in Israel ; presidents of stakes, and high 
councilors ; bishops of wards, Church officers of all grades, who have 
to do with boy life, what a fine program is here, and what co-opera- 
tion and help you will get to the main effort of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints, from this organization, engaged in -lay- 
ing these foundation stones in the life and character of boys! 

Can this program be improved upon? Yes, I think it can be a 
little improved upon. A rather interesting and amusing incident 
happened at the banquet that was given in honor of this National 
Council, gathered in Chicago. Father Cavanaugh, of the Catholic 
Church, who was called upon to deliver an address at the banquet, 
given in honor of the National Council, cautioned the representa- 
tives not to regard scouting as religion. While Rabbi Emil G. Hirsch, 
of Chicago, who was also among the speakers, very boldly proclaimed 
that since so much of scouting had to do with helpfulness to others, 
it was good religion. Mr. J. H. Beveridge, Superintendent 
of Schools of Omaha, and President of the National Education As- 
sociation, held that the movement was chiefly educational. While 
another speaker, Mr. H. H. Merrick, I think, representing the Exec- 
utive Committee of Chicago, stated that he was glad to hear all 



102 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



that had been said by the other speakers in relation to scouting, but 
held that it was an American movement — a movement for good 
American citizenship. And so these parties differed, very greatly, 
but each one contributed a thought worth while, for scouting. 

But now, as to improving upon the scouting program. When 
Brigham Young instituted the Y. M. M. I. Association he said : 

"Let the keynote of your work be the establishment in the youth of 
individual testimony of the truth and magnitude of the great latter-day work; 

the development of the gifts within them, that have been bestowed upon them 
by the laying on of the hands of the servants of God; cultivating a knowledge 
and an application of the eternal principles of the great science of life. It is 
our desire that our young men may grow in the comprehension of and faith 
in the holy principles of the gospel of eternal salvation, and furthermore, have 
an opportunity to testify, and be encouraged in bearing testimony and speak- 
ing of the truths of our holy religion." 

The superintendency of our Mutual Improvement Associations, 
while President Ivins was our superintendent, declared, through the 
Improvement Era, that coupling this spiritual, religious element 
voiced by President Young, with the Boy Scout movement, gave the 
finest program for boy control and guidance, and work, that it was 
possible to conceive. It adds the one other important element to such 
a work; the element that Dr. Widtsoe spoke of a moment since, that 
mysterious, almost indefinable, spiritual ingrejdient anjd power, es- 
sential to the success of things human — it makes it then a genuinely 
religious movement, as well as an educational, a moral, and a physical 
betterment movement. Well, add that religious element to the Boy 
Scout program, and you have, as a means of guidance for the citizen- 
ship of tomorrow, in these United States, the best possible program. 
And so, I commend this movement to you, elders in Israel; bid 
it welcome into your several communities, and grant to it your moral 
and whole hearted support, so that we may extend scouting until 
every Improvement Association shall have its Boy Scout organization. 

Just these words in conclusion. In this thing we cannot as suc- 
cessfully walk alone as we can by keeping step with the national or- 
ganization. I learned a new idea at this National Council, to which 
I have been giving much thought since, namely, a man or a com- 
munity who comes to regard himself as all-sufficient, turns out gener- 
ally to be, and it is the observation of experience, turns out to be in- 
efficient. We cannot be all-sufficient in ourselves in such a work as 
guidance of our youth — such a work as scouting. Wa need the national 
organization. We need it for the classification of scouts, from tender- 
foot to the eagle scout. We need its courts of honor ; we need its system 
of merits and rewards ; we need the "national pull" that is found in 
these things. We need the recognition that the national organization is 
willing to give us. We can not, of course we would not desire, to pla- 
giarize all this organization, and the splendid things that have been de- 
veloped by it. Yet you cannot devise another boy program without 
plagiarizing it — it covers the field so completely — and that being true, 



ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS

there is nothing for us to do but to join in the great national march of 
the boyhood of our land, toward the goal of the highest citizenship. 
Therefore, let us recognize in boy scouting a point of contact with 
our fellow citizens of the United States that is of great advantage to 
us, and through which we also, perhaps, can contribute something to 
the great national movement. Be friendly, therefore, my brethren in 
your attitude towards this great organization, I pray you in the name 
of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

A DELEGATION FROM JAPAN 

I am reminded, by a little note from Elder Junius F. Wells, that 
fifty years ago, February, 1872, a large delegation from Japan, headed 
by Prince Sionii Tomomi Iwakura, Marquis Ito, and other eminent 
Japanese officials, were snow-bound in our great city. We have here 
today a delegation from Japan, and we welcome them with another 
snow storm, which is rather unusual. The above embassy was de- 
tained here for about three weeks. The Territorial Legislature was in 
session at the time and they were extended many courtesies by the 
Mayor, City Council, the Territorial and military officials, and they 
visited this tabernacle and heard the great organ played upon by El- 
der Ridges, its builder. ' Here they had their first glimpse of the 
pioneer work accomplished by the people of Utah, and the great West 
in twenty-five years. They obtained statistics regarding the develop- 
ment and colonization of our beloved country, and studied its gov- 
ernment in our city. It fell to my lot to have the honor of being 
called upon a mission to Japan and open the way there for the spread 
of the gospel, as believed in by the Latter-day Saints. I am very 
glad, indeed, upon this occasion, to welcome some of my friends from 
Japan. 

We also have with us today, as visitors, several members of the 
General Staff of the American Army. 

The choir sang the finale of the Oratorio, "The Restoration," 
under the direction of its composer, Elder Brigham Cecil Gates. 

Benediction was pronounced by Elder James H. Robinson, Presi- 
dent of the South Davis stake of Zion. 

Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock p. m.

An overflow meeting of the Conference was held in the As- 
sembly Hall at 10 o'clock, Sunday morning, April 9, 1922.

ELDER JAMES W. FUNK 

(President of the Benson Stake of Zion.) 

My brethren and Sisters, I have rejoiced in the proceedings of 
this conference thus far, and after the next few moments, I am sure 
I shall rejoice in the remainder of the proceedings. In the midst of 
my surprise at being called upon, and in the fact that I had never 
thought that it should fall to my lot to be called upon, I trust that 
you will bear with me, my brethren and sisters, and that the testimony 
which I may express may find a response in your hearts, and that 
we may have occasion to rejoice together, feeling that God is blessing 
us as He has blessed us in the past, in the worthy work in which we 
are engaged. We are truly grateful for the opportunities we have of 
drawing near unto the Lord through our service in His cause, because 
He said, that if we will draw near unto Him He will draw near 
unto us. And I am sure the experience of every Latter-day Saint 
will confirm that statement of the Lord, that every Latter-day Saint 
who is in His service are, in their humility, drawn near unto Him. It 
is inevitable that, under such circumstances, the Lord will draw near 
unto us. It is the only way of approach to the Lord and to receive 
the blessings of His Spirit, which brings consolation and peace and 
happiness. For, after all, I think little genuine happiness comes to us 
and permanently remains with us, except that it be through the Spirit 
of the Lord, and that sweet influence that comes with association with 
the Spirit of the Lord. No other organization, perhaps, in the world 
affords to its members opportunity for individual effort, and the priv- 
ilege of drawing near unto the Lord by service, as does the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Every member of the Church 
has an opportunity to show faith in the principles of the gospel which 
they have espoused, to show forth faith in God and in His goodness 
and mercy, by their obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel. 
Not only that, but he has opportunity to show faith in his willingness 
to lend a helping hand to his fellow man, and in his desire to be of 
service in this great dispensation of the fulness of times. I am sure 
that those who have had experience in the work of the Lord will 



ELDER JAMES W. FUNK 



105 



bear testimony to this fact, that it is a wonderful work and that 
wonderful blessings follow those who put their heart into it. 

I come from Benson stake, as was announced ; and perhaps some 
of you are inquiring where the Benson stake is. It is not a new stake, 
having been taken from a part of the Cache stake, in the year 1901, 
if I remember correctly the year. It is composed of the northern 
part of Cache county, and was named in honor of Elder Ezra T. Ben- 
son of the Council of the Twelve at one time, and who resided in 
Logan, in the Cache stake, from which Benson stake was taken. 
Cache stake was divided into four stakes. The work is growing there, 
my brethren and sisters, as it is growing in other parts of the vineyard 
of the Lord. This is a day of financial distress, which some of us are 
inclined to call hard times and in fact they are hard times. I some- 
times believe, however, that hard times are more a matter of mental 
attitude than of actual conditions. 

It is hard times because in times of plenty, and a particularly 
easy money market, some of us indulged in the things that we would 
like to avoid, and which we thought, by reason of our prospects, we 
were entitled to; hard times because, in great measure we ignored 
the counsels that were given us, from time to time, by those who' had 
been called to preside over us. In the face of these conditions, I feel 
that the people of the Church have drawn nearer unto the Lord than 
they have done in many years past, and sometimes I have rejocied 
that conditions have so shaped themseves that we are inclined to 1 turn 
toward the Lord, and that we are more inclined to turn toward re- 
ligion, and to be more neighborly, and more sympathetic to our 1 
brethren and sisters than we have been before. 

As a result of the conditions that I have mentioned, I feel that 
the Latter-day Saints are drawing nearer to the Lord today than 
they have drawp before in years past; and the Lord is making good 
His promise to draw near unto the people. 

My brethren and sisters, I know that we are engaged in the 
work of the Lord; that this gospel which has been restored to the 
earth in these the last days is the plan of life and salvation to those 
who believe and do; that the line of succession from the Prophet 
Joseph Smith to the Prophet and President, Heber J. Grant, has been 
unbroken; that the truth which was established in the earth with the 
restoration of the gospel remains upon the earth; that those who pre- 
side over the Church have that same authority that was conferred 
upon Joseph Smith; and that we as a people will be saved and 
exalted just in proportion to our obedience to the laws and ordinances 
of the gospel as promulgated from time to time by the mouthpiece of 
God upon the earth, and his associates. 

May God bless us as Latter-day Saints, and the people of the 
world generally. May He draw, us near unto Him at all times, is my 
prayer, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ELDER HUGH B. BROWN 

(President of the Lethbridge Stake of Zion.) 

I have been shivering ever since I left Canada, and I will be glad 
to get back there, where I can get warm again. I have shivered more 
since I came into this building than before. 

The Lethbridge stake, brethren and sisters, comprises the whole 
of the north end of the world (laughter.) The southern boundary of 
the Lethbridge stake is fifteen miles north of the international bound- 
ary line, between Canada and the United States. I think the northern 
boundary of our stake is, perhaps, the southern boundary of South 
America. We have a very large stake, geographically speaking ; and I 
believe, if we were able to discover all of our people there, we would 
have the largest stake in the Church, numerically speaking, because 
I believe we have in our stake the Ten Tribes. They are up there 
somewhere, although we haven't found them yet. I received a letter 
the other day from some member of the Church, asking me to go up 
into the Peace river country, and organize a branch there. That is 
about 600 miles north of Lethbridge, and Lethbridge is about 700 
miles north of Salt Lake City. We have nine wards and eleven 
branches in the new stake (Lethbridge), and we have some splendid 
people. 

I rejoice in this great work. I thank the Lord for the opportunity 
of working in this cause. I have come to/ realize, in the last few years, 
that men sometimes place high values on things that are not really 
worth while. Sometimes we are found chasing bubbles. 

If you will pardon me, I will refer to a personal experience that 
I had during the late war. It appealed to me more than anything 
else I ever had in my life — some things that are really worth while. 
I had taken a few years in school, in Canada, preparing for military 
work, at the request of the president of the stake ; and at the outbreak 
of the war I held a commission in the Canadian army, and it became 
my duty to put on a uniform, and go and do what little I could dur- 
ing the war. And I had the opportunity of serving, in a weak way, for 
a little over three years, and during that time I had the opportunity 
of preaching the gospel of Christ more than I had during my mission- 
ary experience in England, some seventeen years ago. And while I was 
in uniform, I had the oportunity of extending a helping hand to some 
of our boys. Quite a number of Latter-dav Saint boys went from south- 
ern Lethbridge, from our stake there, and some of them did not return. 
And upon several occasions, while I was in England and France, ap- 
peals came to me from some of the boys who had been wounded who 
were sick in the hospital, asking me to intercede for them with officers 
higher up to make an appeal, if need be, to His Majesty, the King, 
asking that they might be returned home while they were convales- 
cing ; asking, perhaps, that they might have leave of absence. And on 



ELDER HUGH B. BROWN 



107 



several occasions it was my privilege to intercede for the boys and to 
get favors for them. When in London, one morning, I received a 
message that some boy wanted to see me in the hospital ; and imme- 
diately I thought, here is another boy who would like to return to his 
mother, who perhaps is asking me to intercede for him with the pow- 
ers higher up, by reason of the authority that I held as an officer in 
the army. And as I went in response to that call to the hospital re- 
ferred to, I believed that I felt just a little pride in my heart because 
I had the honor of wearing the uniform ; and as I went down to 
that hospital I believe that my head was working, feeling that I was 
going in to do a favor to one of my brethren, by virtue of the fact 
that I held the right to ask for a favor, perhaps, for him from the 
king. With this feeling I went into the hospital, and -as I was ushered 
into the little ward where that boy was sick, with a feeble hand he 
reached out and said, Brother Brown, I sent for you to come and ad- 
minister to me ; I'm afraid I'm going to die, and I want you to ask God 
to spare my life that I can return home to my mother. Upon, that occa- 
sion it seemed to me my uniform fell from me. All the pride that I had 
felt in standing in that uniform of the king vanished. And at that 
moment I was made to realize, that there is an authority, there is a 
power inestimably greater than any authority or power that can be 
given by man. And as I laid my hands upon the head of that boy, 
I interceded for him, not, with the king of England, not with any man, 
and not by virtue of my authority as an officer in that army. But 
as I laid my hands upon his head, I said, "In the name of Jesus Christ, 
and by authority of the Melchizedek Priesthood." 

Brethren and sisters, I came to realize that the most valuable 
thing in this world is the Priesthood of God, the right tot speak and to 
act in the name of God. And as I stood there, as it were clasping 
hands with that boy and his Maker, by virtue of the Priesthood that had 
been given unto me, I forgot any honor that had come to me in tht 
army. And as I knelt at his bedside, my prayer to God was, that 
never again in my life would I be found seeking the honors of men, 
that I would remember that the things that are really worth while in 
this life come to us through the gospel of Jesu3 Christ. 

I thank the Lord for that experience, my brethren and sisters. 
I bear you my testimony that I know that this work is true. That 
time, after a vear "over there," when I came and endeavored to raise 
my voice in defense of this work, I had the joy, the satisfaction, the 
consolation of testifying to the men of the world, that here in the 
west there were a people who were living clean lives, who were obey- 
ing the commandments of God. 

I thank the Lord from the bottom of my heart for the work and' 
the life of the Prophet Joseph Smith. I thank the Lord for the testi- 
mony that I have as to the mission of Brigham Younp". the mission of 
Lorenzo Snow, of John Taylor, of Wilford Woodruff, of Joseph F'.

Smith ; and I thank the Lord, from the bottom of my heart, for the 
mission and the life of Heber J. Grant today. I don't want to be 
classed among the poeple of whom it was said, "You build altars to 
dead prophets, and you hate the living." I honor today men whom 
God has called. I pray you, brethren and sisters, to sustain and sup- 
port these men, for they are ordained of God. 

I hope w,e look upon men from a deeper experience, and judge 
them by that. God looketh upon the heart. He looks into the hearts 
of these men, and he has honored them, and called them to lead this 
people. The Lord makes no mistakes. Let us support these men; 
let us rally round them ; let us let them know that we support them. 
And let us not be found questioning the wisdom of God in any choice 
that He makes. Remember what He said to Samuel, when he went 
down to anoint a king of Israel. When the oldest son of Jesse came 
up, he said: Why, this is the man; look at him; just a fine looking 
fellow, he should be king. But the Lord, said Samuel, did not look 
upon the outward appearance ; God looketh upon the heart. Brethren 
and sisters, let us remember, let us try to do that. But remember that 
God alone possesses the perfect power to look into the hearts of 
men ; and He has chosen these men. May we never be found chasing 
bubbles. May we get the real value fixed in reference to these men. 
Let us go for those things that are really worth while in life. 

Let us pray God for the spirit of humility and meekness. Let 
us keep clean, doing the right as God has given us light to see it, and 
to do your duty. Let us have the courage of our conviction. This 
work is strong, and it will continue to grow. It must go on. The good 
ship Zion has set sail, and if any man wishes to jump overboard, he 
must take the consequence. The good ship will go on. God help 
us to remember that, and to be true to our covenants, true to the 
trust that has been given to us, and always found in the line of duty, 
so that when the call comes, as it came to me on that occasion — the 
call to duty, we will be worthy and ready to respond. Amen. 

ELDER LEWIS R. ANDERSON 

(President of the North Sanpete Stake.) 

My brethren and sisters, if I did not have a testimony of the 
gospel of Jesus Christ, I do not think that I would have the courage 
to face this audience at this time. But I feel I know that I am in the 
house of my friends, associated with my brethren and sisters in this 
great work in which we are engaged, and that their love and faith 
and sympathy go out to one who is placed in this responsible position. 
I had not dreamed of being called to address you here today. But 
I have learned in my experience in the work of the Lord to go where 
I am sent, and I would rather be where I am at this time than any 
place on earth, because I have been called to be here. 



ELDER LEWIS R. ANDERSON

I remember, more than twenty years ago, I received a letter of 
inquiry, asking" if I would accept a mission. It came from President 
Wilford Woodruff, and after I had answered that I would be pleased 
to accept a mission, if I was thought worthy of it, I remember that 
I hoped that when the call came it would not be to the Southern States. 
I had considerable prejudice in my heart against the people of those 
states, because so many of our elders had been mobbed and mistreated 
in that section. And so I hoped in my heart that I would be sent to 
some other part of the world. But when my call came, it read to the 
Southern States mission. And when I got to the headquarters of that 
mission, I was assigned to the middle Tennessee conference, and I ex- 
pected then that I would next be assigned to labor in Lewis county, 
Tenn., where our brethren, Gibbs and Berry, as you remember, were 
killed. But I came to know the Southern people and to appreciate 
their worth, to love the people with whom I had been called to work. 
And, like all missionaries who enjoy their mission and get the spirit 
of their office and calling, I felt that I would rather be working in 
the Southern States than in any other' mission in the world. 

I have been imbued with the spirit of this conference. It has been 
a conference of the foundation of things — getting back to normalcy, 
and I appreciate it. The instruction that we have received from 
President Grant, and the other speakers of this conference, have been 
by the inspiration of the Lord Jesus Christ, and have treated of re- 
pentance, of integrity, dependability, thrift — things which go to make 
up a true life. 

I was impressed with a remark that was made by President Rud- 
ger Clawson, in the talk he gave upon the Bible, admonishing us to* 
study it ; for, said he, if we study it and get a good hold of it, it is 
equal to a college! education, because it treats of every phase of hum^an 
nature, and it contains some of the most beautiful literature that was 
ever penned. And I thought of our great President of this nation, 
Abraham Lincoln, and the books that he had. He had the Bible, 
and was a close student of it. He also had, we are told, the life of 
George Washington, and also had access, I believe, to Aesop's Fables, 
Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress, and possibly one or two other books. 
Now Abraham Lincoln undoubtedly was a learned man. These books 
which he had access to contain the fundamental things, and they were 
ground into his soul, and made him great. And sometimes I think 
that is one of the things that is the matter with us in these troublous 
times, that we do not hold to, and have not had ground into' ouc 
souls, the fundamental things. 

Up at the University the other day, as has been said, we listened? 
to a very notable address by Dr. Carver, Professor of Political Econ- 
omy in H-fvard University. And in one of his comparisons, he likened 
the ho-rs'. hrifty community with one that was dishonest and un- 



110 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



thrifty; and the thought came to me there, that if all the bad people 
— unthrifty, dishonest — were put together in one place where they 
could not take advantage and deceive the good people, they would 
have about all the hell that they are entitled to. 

My brethren and sisters, I rejoice in the gospel, and in all the 
principles thereof, and, as President Brown has said, I trust that we 
will give every loyal support in every way to those who were placed 
over us to lead and to guide us at this time. In that remarkable ad- 
dress of president Ivins, the other day, he pointed out to us in a 
very clear manner, the administrations of the respective prophets who 
have presided over us since the organization of the Church, and that 
each had his special work to perform. Now it is up to us. President 
Grant is our Prophet. We have our problems to solve. We love and 
appreciate the brethren, those in authority who have gone before ; but 
this is our day, let us make the best of it. Let us give full support 
to the living prophets, and may we be able to do so with all our 
might, mind and strength, is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen.

thrall," solo parts by Mrs. Josephine Brower and August Glissmeyer. 

ELDER WINSLOW FARR SMITH 

(President of the Northern States Mission) 
How wonderful is the gospel of Jesus Christ! When I say this 
I refer, not to the religions of the world as we find them, but to the 
gospel of Jesus Christ in its fulness, as it is found in the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints — the gospel as it was given to us, 
the children of our Father, with the grave responsibility of bearing 
its glad message to all the world. In it, I see not only a religion 
for Sunday, which merely brings us together in our place of worship 
for the purpose of singing the praises of our Maker, and listening 
to the words of advice and counsel, but I see in it a religion suited 
to the weakest and the strongest, to the unlearned and the most 
profound student, to the wisest of us all, and yet adapted to the 
needs of every boy and girl. I see in it a force that fits you and 
me for every walk of life. I see in the working of the great Church, 
which God has commissioned to teach this gospel, a vital interest 
in the spiritual and temporal welfare of every one of its members. 

I have rejoiced during this conference to hear divinely com- 
missioned servants of the Lord admonish the Latter-day Saints in 
temporal affairs. I have rejoiced in the counsel of President Grant, 
that the Saints should rally in the support of the institutions of 
Zion to the fullest of their capacity; build them up and strengthen 
them, that there might be means all through the land to carry 
on the great work, and fill the mission that the Church has. When 



ELDER WINSLOW FARR SMITH 111 



we realize that we must buy many things from the outside and 
ponder the fact that every cent we pay for these things, of necessity, 
must go to the outside, shall we not support home institutions ; buy 
the things that can be made here and that can be grown here, so 
that every dollar that these products bring may remain at home 
to build up the institutions that are ours and in turn enrich us as 
a people? 

I believe God inspired Wilford Woodruff to back the great sugar 
industry with the credit of the Church ; and I believe that in these 
trying times, when the men at the head of the Church have placed 
the resources of this people back of these great institutions, it has 
been done with one thought only, and that thought is, that the 
institutions that have made us prosperous shall be preserved to the 
people here at home, and shall not fall into the hands of capitalists 
not interested in us. 

I have listened to criticisms of the policy of the Church in these 
matters, and I am free to say, that I have, in each and every case, 
expressed my opinion that at this time the Saints dare not resort 
to any criticism,, lest they lose their faith. Criticism of the men 
God sustains is the beginning of the loss of faith, and the children 
of our Father who have been called from all the nations of the earth 
to love and rejoice in all the wonderful blessings of the gospel, 
should realize that these men have, deep in their hearts, the interests 
of every one of us. 

I wish every one of you could have come into close contact 
with President Grant in the trying times that we have been passing 
through, when it looked as if our great industries might go to 
the wall. He was in my home in Chicago, in the mission home, 
weighed down with worry and trouble — not personal trouble, but 
anxiety for the interests of the people God has called him to preside 
over ; and I believe that if every true Latter-day Saint realized what 
President Grant went through for the people, in trying to save 
their interests for them, they would be more loyal to the work of 
God and to his divinely appointed servants than they have been in 
the past. I hope and pray that the Saints will consider this matter 
and will awaken to the realization that this difficulty has been met 
largely by the work of the man that God sustains as President of 
His Church upon the earth, and that he should be sustained by every 
member of the Church. 

What does the gospel mean to you? What does the Church 
mean to you ? Is it merely an opportunity that you have of mingling 
together socially, in coming out and studying in the various organ- 
izations and auxiliary associations the outlines that are placed be- 
fore you? Does it mean merely an opportuntiy for you to get for- 
ward in the world? If it does, then you have failed to grasp the 
great mission and the wonderful message and power of the gospel of 



112 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Jesus Christ. It is, my brethren and sisters, not for our spirits only, 
but for our bodies. It is not for time only, but for all eternity. It 
did not begin for you and me when we came here to receive it, but it 
began when time began, and it will continue through all the ages. 
The gospel of Jesus Christ was and is planned for the eternal sal- 
vation and exaltation of His children, a scheme that was devised 
in the heavens, a plan that was laid down with definite laws, with 
commandments, with ordinances that we must hearken unto and to 
which obedience must be rendered, if we will have the blessings that 
this gospel promises. 

God has made us free, has placed us here on earth to live our 
lives just exactly as we want to live them. This gospel of Jesus 
Christ is the perfect law of liberty, and no man, be he weak or be 
he strong, is forced to obey its behests ; but every man is given the 
opportunity, is given the privilege of obtaining perfect liberty con- 
tingent upon rendering obedience to its laws. We came here free, 
free as the very air we breathe, and can elect to go forward along 
the path of righteousness, or can follow along the path of 
unrighteousness and error. But we cannot look for, we can- 
not hope for, nor will we receive, the blessings predicated upon the 
keeping of these laws unless we live them. It is necessary that we 
live righteously to gain eternal life. I tell you, my friends, it is a 
serious thing and the temptations that come to us must be met. We 
hear people say, occasionally, "What a terrible thing it was that 
Adam sinned." They do not realize that the sin of Adam, so- 
called, was in fact a great blessing to you and me, for it made 
possible the establishing of the human family; the bringing of our 
souls into mortality, and permiting us to enjoy the experiences of this 
earth life. By successfully completing the course in this school of 
experiences, we qualify ourselves to live eternally with God and 
Christ in the everlasting kingdom of our Father. "Adam fell that 
men might be, and men are that they might have joy." And so 
it rests with us, whether we will measure up to the standard, avoid 
the temptations that come in our way, and gain that experience, that 
wonderful experience, of the school of mortality, which is absolutely 
necessary to an exaltation in the kingdom of God, our Father. 

When we see temptation round about us, we have the duty of 
meeting it ; of fighting against it and of triumphing over it. If we 
will meet it nobly and exert ourselves to the fullest, giving every 
measure of strength that we have to the great work, then there will 
come to our lives the wonderful joy that God has promised. And 
truly, the happiest man, the happiest woman, on the earth, are 
they who keep the commandments of God. The worth while thing 
is not the wealth of the world, not the honors of men, but that gen- 
uine, deep-seated joy that comes into our hearts, placed there by 
God the eternal Father through the Holy Spirit, when we do our 



ELDER WINSLOW FARR SMITH 



113 



duty. O that every child of our heavenly Father, and every member 
of His Church in particular, might realize what it means to keep the 
commandments of the Lord, and that we, as one united whole, might 
put forth a mighty effort to combat evil in its every form. Then day 
by day we would approach nearer to our heavenly Father, and our 
righteous example would draw into our ranks many souls to aid us 
in the great work of redemption, and the joy of all would be in- 
creased many, many fold. 

It was my privilege recently to visit the site of the City of 
Nauvoo. As I stood on Temple Hill and looked down upon the 
majestic sweep of the river, and recalled that there the Saints had 
been established and had been prospered, only to be driven away and 
to make that memorable journey across the plains, I thanked my 
heavenly Father for the class of men and women who came out of 
the world to accept the gospel, who lived their religion, near to their 
heavenly Father, and who withstood the persecutions that were 
heaped upon them. I thanked God for my parentage. Arid as I 
looked upon the old homes of my ancestors, and the old residences 
of ethers with whose names you are familiar, I could not help say- 
ing, God knew what He was doing when He permitted persecutions 
to come to those people, for they were tried in the fiery furnace; 
they grew stronger under opposition; they were victorious over 
temptations and trials that were placed before them; and they 
were blessed and sustained, and though they came into' this wil- 
derness with hardly enough food to sustain them through the first 
season, and though they were opposed by the nation and harassed 
by the Indians; yet they were true to their covenants, to their 
heavenly Father, and He blessed them and sustained them, and 
buoyed them up, and now we are enjoying the fruits of their faith- 
fulness. 

If we could only heed that admonition of our president to leave 
those things alone that come from the outside, that are a curse to 
us, — I refer to those things decried in the Word of Wisdom — and 
could the money that we send away from home for tea, coffee, 
tobacco, liquors and coco-cola be applied to the establishment of 
industrial institutions, and in the carrying on of the work of the Lord, 
and if we were to live this holy law, then the peoples of the earth 
would have to look up in admiration to the people of God. 

My brethren and sisters, this gospel is for you and me. It is 
a reality, a genuine thing, and not a passing fancy Those who keep 
every one of the commandments of our Father and live near to Him, 
and do the things that He has laid down for them, are happy. All 
others receive joy in a direct ratio to the effort they put forth. 

We are today passing through a period of persecution. In the 
British Isles it is especially severe and trying, while in our own 
country there are some who attempt to injure us by their malicious

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



stories. The lives of the Saints and the achievements of the Church 
stand up before the world greater and more glorious than ever, 
despite the vituperations of the hirelings who do that work. The 
gospel of Jesus Christ is genuine. It is the power of God unto sal- 
vation. It is the true way for you and for me. It stands for good 
citizenship. Good Latter-day Saints are loyal citizens ill the coun- 
try, regardless of the party they may individually belong to. A good 
Latter-day Saint is a credit to his nation, for he upholds the men in 
power and he is striving continually to do his part as a man, being 
honest with his fellow men, and with his Master. I believe that 
this great nation of ours was divinely brought forth, that it might 
be a place for the coming forth of the gospel of Jesus Christ. I 
believe that that grand old flag of ours, the red, the white and blue, 
will always shine out as an emblem of liberty to the nations of the earth. 
I believe that God will not permit men to come into power as leaders 
in our nation who will disgrace those jnoble colors. That banner 
of liberty was given to the world that under it the gospel of Jesus 
Christ might come forth ; and when the time had arrived, when 
the hour had struck, when the world was ready, God chose a humble 
boy in the backwoods of New York and gave him the divine com- 
mission to go forth and establish His Church. 

He did as commanded, and though the Church has been perse- 
cuted, and men have heaped upon it all manner of opposition ; yet, 
after ninety years, it stands unimpeached and unimpeachable, be- 
cause it is the work of Almighty God. Its destiny is to fill the earth ; 
its mission is to preach the gospel to all mankind ; its purpose is to 
prepare the human family for the coming of Jesus Christ to reign 
as king of kings and Lord of Lords. And we, who remain true, 
who keep the commandments of the living God, will when Christ 
comes to take His place be found in our places, glorified, blessed of 
our heavenly Father, and He will say unto us, "Well done, thou 
good and faithful servant." 

Let us be true, my brethren and sisters. Let us be loyal to our 
state and to our. nation ; loyal to ourselves and to the Church. Stand 
back of the men God chooses and sustains to preside over us. 

If we will do this, our hearts will be joyful; our lives will be 
filled with blessings, and the fame of the Latter-day Saints will go 
forth to all the world. Then nothing can stop the onward march 
and the work of God will triumph. 

A duet, "Grant us peace," was sung by Agnes Bolto and Don 
Priestly, obligato part by Ruby Childs, and a mixed double quartette.

ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 

{President of the Southern States Mission) 

I humbly pray that I may be blessed with the Spirit of the Lord 
and speak lunder that divine power by which words are carried unto the 
hearts of the children of men. 

"The rights of the priesthood are inseparably connected with the 
powers of heaven." This comforting truth has been abundantly mani- 
fested in this conference thus far, for by the rights of the Priesthood, 
the President of the Church, his counselors, and other general authori- 
ties have spoken unto Israel, and the powers of heaven have responded, 
to the instruction and comfort of the Latter-day Saints. We are half 
in heaven and half on earth when we do the will of the Father; for 
there is no liberty so sweet and enduring as the liberty of the gospel ; 
and the wealth, the honors, the dignities of the world cannot equal 
nor bring that peace which comes from a still and quiet conscience, 

Isaiah said: 

"For unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given; and the govern- 
ment shall be upon His shoulder; and His name sholl be called Wonderful,, 
Counsellor, the mighty God, the everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace." 

It was the Prince of Peace who inspired President Warren G. 
Harding to call that notable assembly, the Disarmament Conference. 
Under the Spirit of the Prince of Peace, that conference labored to do 
away with the horrors of war, and 'bring peace to a troubled world. 
Is it not the beginning of the fulfilment of that great prediction that 
swords shall be beaten into plowshares and spears into pruninghooks? 
As the Lord can send peace to the nations who seek him t so can he send 
peace to the laboring conscience. In the beginning of this dispensation 
God commanded that the elders of this Church should preach repentance 
unto the people, because if people do not repent, they become ripened 
in iniquity, and then their doom is sealed, for the fulness of the wrath of 
God comes upon people and nations when they are ripened in iniquity. 

By the word of the Lord this land was designated as the land of 
promise, which was choice above all other land's, which the Lord God 
had preserved for a righteous people * * * whoso should possess 
this land of promise, from that time henceforth and forever, should 
serve Him, the true and only God, or they should be swept off when the 
fulness of his wrath should come upon them.. * * * And the 
fulness of His wrath cometh upon them when they are ripened in 
iniquity. Moroni, in the second chapter of the book of Ether, gives 
this solemn warning to the people of this dispensation. He had in mind 
the people of the world today when "he spoke this word of warning: 

"And this cometh unto you,, O ye Gentiles, that ye may know the 
decrees of God — that ye may repent, and not continue in your iniquities 
until the fulness come, that ye may not bring down the fulness of the wrath 
of God upon you as the inhabitants of the land have hitherto done." 



116 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



In the same book is a fateful prophecy. The prophets "testified 
that a great curse should come upon the land, and also upon the 
people, and that there should be a great destruction among them, such 
an one as never had been upon the face of the earth, and their bones 
should become as heaps of earth upon the face of the land, except they 
should repent of their wickedness.'' On the banks of the Tennessee 
river, near Chattanooga, is an artificial hill, called the Citico Mound. 
The officials of the county in which the mound is situated were build- 
ing a road and had commenced to plow away the mound ; but the lead- 
ing Presbyterian minister of that city protested against it as an act of 
desecration. Why? Because scientists who had explored that mound 
discovered it to be a vast tomb filled with the hones of men and women 
upon whom judgments had fallen because of their iniquity. This is 
one evidence of the fulfilment of that prophecy. I ask you, is that not 
a proof that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God and that the Book of 
Mormon was translated by the gift and power of God? 

What sin brings men and women in the ripeness of iniquity? I 
tell you, my brethren and sisters, it is immorality. Coming from 
Miami, a few weeks ago, to Jacksonville, in an automobile, a distance of 
four hundred miles, we saw many automobiles on the road in the dead' 
of night, after the clock had tolled the hour of midnight, and in these 
automobiles we could see by the light of the moon, girls of tender age, 
young women and young men, ofut riding that time of night in the 
country over lonely roads. Such practice will result in disaster. Young 
men and young women, who go automobile riding in the dead of night, 
when it is not necessary to make such journeys, so sure as God lives are 
sowing the seeds of misery and sorrow. "Woe to them," says the 
prophet, "that are at ease in Zion." Woe to the parent who is at ease 
when his sons and daughters are out pleasure-riding at night. Woe to 
the parents who are lulled into a sense of fancied security concerning 
their sons and daughters. These precious and splendid young men and 
women who come to the missions to preach the word of God are choice 
spirits — the greatest blessing that God has given to His people. 
' Isaiah declared that Jesus was "a man of sorrows." 

"But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our 
iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon Him; and with His stripes 
we are healed." 

Physicians find diseases that baffle their skill, but 

"Earth holds no sorrow that heaven cannot heal." 

Jesus Christ is the 

"Joy of the desolate, light of the straying, 
Hope of the penitent, fadeless and pure." 

He, hy His gospel, will heal the diseased mind ; He will pluck from 



ELDER CHARLES- A. CALLIS 



117 



the repentant heart the sting of sin and wickedness. He will remove 
that awful torture of remorse of conscience, if the sinner will surrender 
unconditionally to Him and obey the gospel. The Apostle John says, 

"But if we walk in the light, as He is in the light,, we have fellowship 
one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ, His Son, cleanseth us from 
all sin." 

But suppose the sinner elects to take the downward path and 
become a law unto himself. What then? Listen to what the Lord says : 

"For behold, I, God, have suffered these things for all that they might 
not suffer if they would repent." 

What wonderful goodness ! Well might Paul say, 

"For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was 
rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty, might 
be rich." 

Not rich according to the things of the world, but rich as to the 
things of God — the gift of salvation, the boon of eternal life, which will 
exalt us in the presence of God. 

"But if they would not repent, they must suffer even as I." 

Now Jesus describes the suffering of the sinner. Listen to Him : 

"Which suffering caused myself, even God, the greatest of all, to 
tremble because of pain, and to bleed at every pore, and to suffer both 
body and spirit; and would that I might not drink the bitter cup and shrink. 

"Nevertheless, glory be to the Father, and I partook and finished my 
preparations unto the children of men: 

"Wherefore, I command you again to repent,, lest I humble you with 
my almighty power, and that you confess your sins, lest you suffer these 
punishments of which I have spoken, of which in the smallest, yea, even 
in the least degree you have tasted at the time I withdrew my Spirit." 

What makes an apostate bitter? What makes a man rebellious at 
heart, and fight with fury and bitterness of soul the Church and the 
leaders whom God hath appointed?. I tell you, my brethren and sisters, 
it is the sins which were forgiven him at baptism that have returned 
unto him ; for so hath the Lord said. He commands men to retain by a 
godly life the remission of their sins, but if they sin, he withdraws His 
Spirit ; they are left to themselves, they are filled with bitterness and 
hate for the work of God ; no matter how bright, how glowing, how 
strong the testimony of the gospel, it cannot live, it will not abide, 
when men who had that testimony do wickedly. And they return to 
their former sins, as the dog to his vomit, and the sow to her wallow- 
ing in the mire, their former sins return to them and they are left in 
the bitterness of sin and in the thralldom and bondage of Satan. 

"Salvation," said the prophet Joseph Smith, "is for a man to be 



118 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



saved from all his enemies ; for until a man can triumph over death 
he is not saved. A knowledge of the Priesthood alone will do this." 
By the power of Jesus Christ the faithful Saints shall arise in the glory 
of the resurrection, clothed in white, heirs of God, and joint heirs of 
Jesus. 

Brethren and sisters, I bear you my testimony that this gospel is 
the power of God unto salvation. Just as surely as I know that I 
stand here, I know that Jesus is our Redeemer, and that He liveth and 
maketh intercession with God for the children of men. By the same 
Spirit I know that this gospel is the power of God Unto salvation — 
that salvation which shall conquer death and bring light, immortality, 
and glory and exaltation in the kingdom of God. 

Those here who do not belong to this Church, who have not 
tasted of the sweetness of the fruits of the gospel, I invite to 
repent and to be baptized for the remission of their sins, and they shall 
receive, by the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost, a 
testimony that Jesus is the Christ, that Joseph Smith was and is a 
prophet of God, and that this gospel is in truth and in deed the power 
of God unto salvation, which I testify in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

The anthem, "Send out Thy light," was sung by the combined 
choir. 

Benediction was pronounced by Elder George J. Cannon, a mem- 
ber of the General Board Y. M. M. I. A. 



SECOND OVERFLOW MEETING 

The second overflow meeting was held in the Assembly Hall, 
Sunday afternoon, 2 o'clock, April 9, 1922. 

Elder Samuel O. Bennion, president of the Central States mis- 
sion, presided.

ELDER REY L. PRATT 

(President of the Mexican Mission.) 

"And it shall come to pass, that if the Gentiles shall hearken unto the 
Lamb of God in that day that He shall manifest Himself unto them in word 
and also in power, in very deed unto the taking away of their stumbling 
blocks, and if they harden not their hearts against the Lamb of God, they 
shall be numbered among the seed of thy father : yea, they shall be number- 
ed among the house of Israel; and they shall be a blessed people upon the 
promised land forever; they shall be no more brought down into captivity; 

and the house of Israel shall no more be confounded And 

it came to pass that the angel spake unto me, Njephi, saying, Thou hast 
beheld that if the Gentiles repent it shall be well with them; and thou also 
knowest concerning the covenants of the Lord unto the house of Israel; 
and thou also hast heard that whoso repenteth not must perish. Therefore, 
wo be unto the Gentiles if it so be that they harden heir hearts against the 
Lamb of God. For the time cometh, saith the Lamb of God, that I will 
work a great and a marvelous work among the children of men; a work 
which shall be everlasting, either on the one hand or on the other — either 
to the convincing of them unto peace and life eternal, or unto the deliverance 
of them to the hardness of their hearts and the blindness of their minds 
unto their being brought down into captivity, and also into destruction,, both 
temporally and spiritually, according to the captivity of the devil,, of which 
I have_ spoken." I Nephi 14: 1-7. 

These are the words that the Lord spoke through His prophet 
Nephi, when He gave unto him the vision of what should be upon 
this continent in the last days. He beheld that the remnant of his 
seed that should be mingled with the Lamanites, should be brought 
down by the hand of the Gentile nations that should come in among 
them. He prophesied also that the Lord would not permit the Gen- 
tiles to remain in a state of darkness, described by him incident to, or 
touching, the great and abominable church in their midst, incident 
to the fact that the holy scriptures had been wrested and twisted 
among them, to the end that the people were not able to discover or dis- 
cern which was right or which was wrong ; but the Lord would through 
his mercy, establish among the Gentiles the fulness of His everlasting 
gospel. And he made wonderful promises unto the Gentiles, who 
should be blessed. And here he sets forth very plainly, that if they 
would give heed to the teachings of that gospel that would be restored 
among them, they should be numbered among those of the house of 
Israel, they should be blessed for ever, they should not be molested 
in their possession of this land of promise. But there is another side 
of the question here, and it is specifically set forth that if they should 
not serve the Lord with full purpose of heart, if they should turn 
from Him, they should be destroyed, and that not only temporally but 
also spiritually. I find in this Book of Mormon things that to me 
are very pertinent, for this is the very nation described. This book 
is one that has come into the world with the restoration of the 
gospel. It is true, it is the word of the Lord given through His 
ancient prophets and apostles upon this land, who foresaw our day. 



120 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



And inasmuch as the note has been sounded in this conference, of 
repentance, it seems to me timely to call attention to some of these 
things that so specifically point to our day; for if we are not mindful 
as a people, if we are not mindful as a nation, if the Gentile people 
who have come here do not give heed to the inspired word of God, 
do not accept the gospel as offered to them, this scripture foretells for 
them an awful destruction. 

I would like to read to you the Lord's decree, the first decree 
that we have any account of having been given, concerning this land 
on which we dwell. This decree was given to the brother of Jared, 
a great prophet who led his people to this land at a very early day. 
You will find it in the words of the brother of Jared given in the 
second chapter of the Book of Ether, through Moroni, who abridged 
the history of the Jaredites found on the gold plates. It is there 
stated : 

"And it came to pass that they did travel in the wilderness, and did 
build barges, in which they did cross many waters, being directed continually 
by the hand of the Lord. And the Lord would not suffer that they should 
stop beyond the sea in the wilderness but He would that they should come 
forth even unto the land of promise, which was choice above all other lands, 
which the Lord God had preserved for a righteous people. And He had 
sworn in His wrath unto the brother of Jared, that whoso should possess 
this land of promise from that time henceforth and forever should serve 
him, the true and only God,, or they should be swept off when the fulness of 
His wrath should come upon them. And now, we can behold the decrees of 
God concerning this land, that it is a land of promise; and whatsoever 
nation shall possess it shall serve God, or they shall be swept off wjhen 
the fulness of His wrath has come upon them. And the fulness 
of His wrath cometh upon them wh'en they are ripened in 
iniquity. For behold, this is a land which is choice above all other lands; 
wherefore he that doth possess it shall serve God or shall be swept off; 
for it is the everlasting decree of God. And it is not until the fulnes of 
iniquity among the children of the land that they are swept off. And this 
cometh unto you, O ye Gentiles, that ye may know the decrees of God — 
that ye may repent, and not continue in your iniquities until the fulness 
come, that ye may not bring down the fulness of wrath of God 
upon you as the inhabitants of this land hath hitherto done. Behold, 
this is a choice land,, and whatsoever nation shall possess it shall be 
free from bondage, and from captivity, and from all other nations under 
heaven, if they will but serve the God of the land, who is Jesus Christ 
who hath been manifested by the things which we have written. " 

Here again we find the perfect warning voice of God coming 
to the Gentiles who should possess this land. Now the question of 
all importance to us is not armies, not navies, is not ambition, is not 
universities, is not learning, but the question to us is, wherein lies 
the security of this great Gentile nation? Not only the one but the 
many Gentile nations commingling, making a nation that has built one 
of the greatest governments that has ever been known, that has es- 
tablished better laws and better living conditions than have ever be- 
fore been known among the children of men since the creation, things 
that are in every way desirable? But I repeat, that the continuance 



ELDER REY L. PRATT 



121 



of these conditions depends upon the fact as to whether the people 
will accept and subscribe to the principles of the gospel. And to ac- 
cept the gospel is none other, nor aught else than to put our lives in 
harmony with the laws of eternal truth, which are God's laws ; the laws 
by which all that is was created, and all that is, is sustained in 
the universe ; and when those laws are controverted, when those laws 
are disobeyed, that disobedience brings disintegration, and destruc- 
tion, and the ultimate annihilation of those who indulge in breaking 
them. Is there not today, by the prophets, seers and revelators, who 
stand at the head of Israel, who are God's mouth-pieces unto the 
world today, who sound the cry of repentance today, and also to 
the whole earth — is there not again a sounding of that decree ? 

We have not only the testimony of your sons in the mission 
field, who come in contact with the world ; the testimony of mission 
presidents who sound their voices to and mingle their voices in, all 
parts of this fair land, Canada and Mexico ; but we have the testimony 
of this nation's statesmen and great men, that there has never been a 
time in the history of this country, when there was so crying a need 
for repentance as there is today. I believe we are living in the ful- 
filment of the time spoken of by Paul, in his Epistle to Timothy. This 
is as I find it, and I hope you will not take it that I am a calamity 
howler, and that I do this for effect. I consider it incumbent upon 
me to raise my voice abroad and at home ; and I do not let an oppor- 
tunity pass, to sound my voice, even the cry of repentance, in the 
ears of the people, so that not only we, but the nations and people 
with whom we dwell, might repent, and be saved in the kingdom 
of heaven. I believe we are living in the time of the fulfilment of 
the words spoken by the Apostle Paul to Timothy: (II Tim. 3:1-7.) 

"This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For 
men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, prou<A, blas- 
phemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural af- 
fection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce,, despisers of those 
who are good, traitors, heady highminded, lovers of pleasures more than 
lovers of God, having a form of godliness,, but denying the power thereof; 
from such turn away. For of this sort are they which creep into houses,, 
and lead captive silly women, laden with sins, led away with divers lusts, 
ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth." 

I request you candidly, brethren and sisters, to ask yourselves the 
question, was there ever a time when you have seen manifested so 
great a spirit of selfishness as there is today, individually, in groups, 
in cities, and nationally? We find this selfish instinct more apparent 
than I have ever seen it in my life. Do we not find ourselves to be 
deceivers, truce-breakers, and find the same in others? And do we 
not find ourselves hating one another, partaking of practices of the 
world that are not righteous? Why, I am constantly kept in hot 
water. I came up here, in the last two weeks, from the interior of 
Mexico, and I find here, in the newspapers and among the people, 
things that are slanderous to the Mexican people, things that are 



122 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



given out as facts without facts to support them. But they are slan- 
derous to those people ; they stir up hatred against the people there, 
and when I return I am, of course, asked about such things, and hence 
am kept in hot water. We go to the southern republic, and we find 
the press of that country rampant over the treatment that they re- 
ceive, that is heaped upon their citizens who happen to be here, and 
I have to act in the roll of a pacifier in both countries. I try to make 
them see that it is not the work of the masses, but of agitators, and 
I think likely that class is to be found here. 

In the religions of the day do we find the power of God, or is 
there more likely to be found a form of godliness, and the men en- 
gaged in religious pursuits denying the power of godliness, more than 
we find in them a living and loving faith, and the love of God and His 
righteousness? I wish to read a little extract from the Literary 
Digest of February 25 : 

''Interviewed by a reporter of the New York Times, several clergymen 
exhibit, we _are told,, a decidedly 'liberal' tendency, one of them going so 
far as saying that many Methodists in good standing had only a 'technical' 
belief in the verbal inspiration of the Bible, and that in his opinion a man 
might be a good Methodist and believe, for instance, that the Biblical 
account of the creation, literally understood, was not in accordance with 
the fact." 

. Further on in the article it says : 

"People widen their experience. They are simply out-growing these old 
points of view. There has been an emancipation in theological views about 
the verbal inspiration of the Bible. The belief in verbal inspiiation is only 
technically held today by a great many people. Today we "emphasize 
the spirit of the word. The great thing is to exercise discrimination. There 
are good books and bad, and you have to discriminate but nobody can do 
that for rne. The attitude of most Methodists toward Darwinism, I think 
is that it is accepted with reservations. There is a certain type of mind which 
carries it too far, and makes it odious. But the principle is believed in 
general'y. It is the great fundamental law of life." 

My brethren and sisters, if God does not exist, why then the 
need of any ism in all the wide world ? If the world does not need 
I will say, any moral life, and God did not create us, why then con- 
tinue any nonsense along that line? They go further than this and 
many ministers tell you that Jesus Christ is a fiction, as a living entity 
never did live; that the Christ story is only a beautiful story con- 
cocted for whatever end it might serve. So they have, I say, a form 
of godliness, but they deny the very foundation upon which' it rests 
and must rest. I thank God I believe in Him as a literal tangible 
Being, who is my Father, and whose child I am, and I feel that I can 
go to Him in all of my anxieties, if I would go in the true spirit- 
and I can get salvation ; I can get help. I am" thankful, but not in 
the spirit of the Pharisee, who thanked the Lord that he "was not as 
other men," but from the bottom of my heart I thank the Lord that 



ELDER REY L. PRATT 



123 



I know I am created in the image of the Lord, my Maker; that I 
know that Jesus Christ came into the world, and was and is the Son 
of God, that He taught wisdom to men, whereby they may be, as He 
has again been, exalted into the celestial kingdom of our Father in 
heaven. 

Perhaps I would not have spoken in this vein, had it not been 
sounded in this conference; but I lift my voice with those who have 
spoken in this conference, and those who are crying, "Repent, ye 
nations of the earth, for the kingdom of God is at hand." 

Do I fear for this Church that has been established, although we 
are surrounded by temptations and the evils of the world? No. But 
I do know that this Church was established in these last days on 
the rock of revelation, and it will go on to its success. And I do 
know that we have a duty incumbent upon us to tell it to those who 
do not see as we see. That obligation comes with the knowledge we 
have of the gospel. I am perfectly positive and sure that the Church 
will go on to ultimate success and triumph. The only fear I have 
is, will I be able to stay with it? Will I be able to keep myself clean 
and unspotted from the sins of the world? And next to that, will my 
children, surrounded as they are by the evils and temptations of the 
world, be able to keep themselves pure and clean and unspotted from 
the sins of the world, and triumph with the work of God? 
And, next to that, will you, and particularly your children, 
be able to do likewise? That is the concern I have for 
Israel. After that, my concern is to gather from the world those who 
are honest at heart, who are, like ourselves, our Father's children — 
millions of them in the world ; and we want to teach them the way 
that they may escape calamities that will come upon them, if they do 
not repent. 

Now, is this promise of destruction a myth? I will only say 
that its fulfilment or non-fulfilment depends upon this people. You 
will find in the words of Moroni, that the Lord will destroy the 
people if they do not repent, even as He has hitherto done. I am a 
witness. As I have traveled over the valleys of Mexico I have seen 
evidences of the mighty judgments that came upon the people of a 
former generation that have lived upon this land. One month ago 
yesterday, with some fellow missionaries — perhaps some of your sons 
— I stood in the midst of a majestic ruined city. If Salt Lake City 
were to be ruined, and be left in a state of decomposition for as long 
a time as that one has been, it would leave, in comparison, but a mere 
scratch upon the land. . Those were a mighty people that have built 
cities that are wonderful even in their ruins today. I stood upon 
the summit of a mighty building in that city of Mexico, covering 
more ground at its base than the block on which we stand, the other 
day, and looked as far as I could see, and saw the mounds of that 
ruined city. They were a cultured people and highly civilized who 
had built that city. But the Book of Mormon recounts to us that 



124 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



there came a time when they became ripened in iniquity. And what 
did God do? He swept them off the land as completely as if they 
had never been, according to appearances which remain. Will he 
do it again? My knowledge is, that he will, except the people serve 
the God of the land, who is Jesus Christ. Therefore, I repeat to you 
that there lies for Israel, aye for America, no other way of safety 
but in keeping and living the commandments of God. 

This is the Lord's Church. I know that it is true. Sometimes 
the preaching of the elders, or sometimes even the word of the 
Savior, incites the ill-will of those who cannot see just exactly as we 
do. I wish to read you the words of the Savior Himself as recorded 
in the 15th chapter of Matthew: 

"Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees;, which were of Jerusalem, 
saying, Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? For 
they wash not their hands when they eat bread. But he answered and 
said unto them, Whyi do ye also transgress the commandment of God by 
your tradition? For God commanded, saying, Honor thy father and mother: 
and, He that curseth father and mother, let him die the death. But ye say, 
Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother. It is a gift, by whatsoever 
thou mightest be profited by me; and honor not his father or his mother, he 
shall be free. Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect 
by your tradition. Ye hypocrites;, well did Esaias prophesy of you saying, 
This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth and honoreth me with 
their lips; but their heart is far from me. But in vain they do worship me, 
teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. And He called the 
multitude and said unto them, Hear, and understand: Not that which goeth 
into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, 
this defileth a man. Then came his disciples, and said unto Him, Knowest 
thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying? But 
He answered and said, Every plant which my heavenly Fr.ther hath not 
planted,, shall be rooted up. Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the 
blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch." 

So we say, that every plant that is not planted of our heavenly 
Father shall be by Him rooted up. And what care we, though the 
world scoff and scorn. This Church has been nurtured on persecu- 
tion from the day of its inception ; and if it brings persecution to 
declare ihe truth, let it come, for our duty is to warn the world and 
call men unto repentance. 

Oh, we do not preach that all men are lost. There are none, 
so far as we know, lost, only if they continue to do evil. Then they 
will be lost. But today, even as in the times of old, the Savior, 
through His disciples, through His ministers, through His mission- 
aries that are sent into the world, is crying to the world to come 
to Him. I almost fancy I can hear His voice, as He said to Jeru- 
salem : "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and 
stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gath- 
ered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens 
under her wings, and ye would not ! Behold, your house is left unto 
you desolate." But how literally has that promise been fulfilled upon 
the Jews. They still have an opportunity, but they have no oppor- 



ELDER KEY L. PRATT 



125 



tunity to return, save by the road of repentance, and acknowledging 
Jesus as the Christ, the Son of the living God, their King and their 
Ruler whom they have to look upon as their Lord and their Savior. 

God help us, my brethren and sisters, to realize our true position 
as fathers and mothers in Zion, to teach our children lessons of chas- 
tity, purity and truth, that they may know how to pray to our 
Father in heaven ; teach them the principles of the gospel, of life, of 
health. All you fathers and mothers, get close to your boys in this 
age, get close to your daughters, and know where they are, and what 
they are doing, for man)' times they suffer by coming in contact with 
evil and ignorantly embracing it, not knowing the consequence ; and 
the responsibility may rest, in many instances, upon the father or 
the mother, who has not taken proper care in teaching their young 
folks. It is a time when men want wealth, they want riches, want 
commodities and comforts; but, my brethren and sisters, my .concern 
is not so much for these things as for the eternal truth, and those 
things which are of God, for our true and proper living. These 
are the pearls of great price. They are greater than all other things 
given to man. 

May God help us to fulfil our mission and destiny upon the 
earth in righteousness, I pray, in the name of the Lord, Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

ELDER NEPHI JENSEN 

(Presidept of the Canadian Mission) 

I sincerely pray in my heart, that the Spirit of our heavenly 
Father shall attend me and give me utterance while I stand before 
you this afternoon. I appear before you with a sense of humility and 
obligation, and I ask you to pray for me, that I shall be your spokes- 
man, and deliver to you counsel and instructions that will be edifying 
to you as well as myself. 

I am thankful, with all my heart, for membership in this great 
Church. I am thankful for the opportunity of coming here from 
my home in Eastern Canada, to participate with you in the worship 
of our Father. I am thankful for the impressions and inspiration 
that have come to my heart while attending the sessions of this great 
conference. 

We think it is stormy here at the present time. But we have 
had a storm in Toronto, Canada, recently in comparison with which 
our storm here is but a gentle summer zephyr. We have had, back 
there, a storm of agitation against this people, and the message of 
truth that this people is endeavoring to deliver to the world. 

We have passed through a fierce storm of newspaper agitation 
in the city of Toronto during the last few weeks. Through it all 
I have been reminded of the statement of the great Emerson, that 
there is a compensation in all things. I noticed, as I have often 



126 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



noticed in the past, that when men commence to speak against us, 
they very frequently unwittingly bear testimony to the divinity of 
this great work. I recall an incident of this kind some years ago. 
There was held, as I now remember, in the state of Idaho, in the 
year 1908, a convention of the Christian Endeavorers. One of the 
speakers at that convention was Mr. G. W. Barnes, the president of 
the association. He was so close to the "Mormon" territory that he 
could not quite resist the temptation to throw a few rocks over into 
the state of Utah. But a singular thing among the statements he 
made against this people and our religion, is the fact that he unin- 
tentionally testified of the vitality and the fervor of spirit which are 
found in this great Church. He said, "We can never hope to crush 
'Mormonism' until we have a zeal equal to that of the 'Mormons.' " 
I have often wondered why any minister of religion should have a 
desire in his heart to destroy a religion which plants in the human 
heart living faith in the living God, and inspires them with a self- 
forgetting zeal that sends them to the ends of the world to testify 
of the great things of our God. But, singular as it is, it is never- 
theless a fact that the men who endeavor to bring to naught the pur- 
poses of this- great work, unwittingly testify of the greatness of 
God's Latter-day kingdom. 

Another instance of this kind came to my attention a few months 
ago in the Dominion of Canada. There lives up there in our country 
over in the province of Saskatchewan a minister of a Protestant 
church, by the name of Toombs. He wrote a lengthy pamphlet against 
our religion. In the course of his article he said that the organiza- 
tion of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was most 
wonderful. He became even more superlative, he said: "It may be 
even said to be perfect." Shortly after the publication of this pamph- 
let, the great Anglican church, which is a division of the Church of 
England, deemed it necessary to put out a pamphlet against the pro- 
paganda of our Church in the Dominion of Canada. They could 
find nothing that suited their purpose better than the article written 
by Mr. Toombs. And so in the month of July, 1921, the great Angli- 
can church published the Toombs article as its Bulletin No. 44, against 
"Mormonism." That bulletin contains the significant statement that 
the "Mormon" Church "may be said to be perfect." When I read 
that statement in that bulletin, I felt deeply grateful to the great 
Church of England. I have felt like writing them a letter, thanking 
them heartily for testifying officially" to the divinity of the Church 
of which we are members. For this bulletin does contain a very im- 
pressive testimony of the divinity of our Church. 

We have always been led to believe that when you say that any- 
thing is perfect, it is equivalent to saying that it is divine. If we were 
to select that adjective which most completely describes God's attri- 
butes, we would select the adjective "perfect." God is perfect. And 
that which he establishes in the world is perfect. So we might well 



ELDER NEPHI JENSEN 



127 



be truly thankful in our hearts, that from the seats of the mighty, 
men are commencing to testify, even though it be unwittingly, to the 
divinity of this great work. 

Not only is this great Church of ours perfect in organization, but 
there is in it also the perfect Spirit of Jesus Christ. What is it in 
the ministry of the Son of God that impresses us as being most di- 
vine? All of you would say that it is His great spirit of self-sacrifice, 
And so it is. 

Just a few days ago, I had the opportunity of attending a won- 
derful priesthood meeting, in one of the wards of this city. There 
were present at this priesthood meeting several hundred splendid men 
of all ages who bear the Priesthood of the Son of God. At that meet- 
ing a number of men, who had recently been called to go out into the 
world to preach the gospel, were called upon to speak briefly. I 
recall distinctly one of them. He was a German. He had been con- 
verted to the Church in far-away Germany, some eight or nine years 
ago. This plain man came to this country with his family. Since 
his arrival here he has been pursuing the plain occupation of a laborer. 
Through his industry, thrift and frugality, he has been able to save 
a few hundred dollars. Because of the beautiful, divine spirit of 
self-sacrifice in his heart, he has accepted a call to go to his mother 
country to preach the gospel. He is going out to spend the money 
that he has earned by hard labor, in testifying to the world of the 
- restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ. I want you to know that 
when I heard that plain man's testimony, my heart thrilled with grati- 
tude because I was a member of that Church which puts this splen- 
did, divine spirit of self-sacrifice into the hearts of men. 

There is in this great Church also the power of the living God. 
T recall today, with deep emotion, and a sense of gratitude, thje 
blessing which came to me on the first Sunday of the month of March 
this year. At that time the storm of agitation, in the city of Toronto, 
had reached its crest. Because of the strain I underwent in writing 
newspaper articles in defense of our people, I felt that a nervous 
break-down was coming upon me. I requested the Saints and the 
members of the Church in Toronto to fast and pray for me the first 
Sunday in the month of March. Before our good people had con- 
cluded their fast on that day, our missionaries came to the Mission 
Home and held a prayer circle for me. While these young men and 
women prayed for me, my flesh quivered all over, because of the 
power of God's Spirit which came upon me. One of my companions, 
a mere boy, scarcely out of his teens, laid his hands upon my head, 
and said, "You shall be made well from this very day." I can testify 
today, in the sincerity and gratitude of my heart, that those words 
came to me by the voice of the Holy Ghost. I can testify moreover 
that my heavenly Father has remembered those words, and made 
them true in my life. God be praised for His goodness and kindness 
to me. With all my heart I thank my heavenly Father, that I belong 



128 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



to this great organization. With all my heart I thank him that I 
have had the opportunity of spending six years of my short life on 
the firing line of truth, telling the people of the marvelous things God 
has wrought in our day and time. 

I know that there is in this great Church the spirit and power of 
God. I know that outside of this wonderful organization there is no 
peace, but chaos, confusion, destruction and misery. It is good to be 
in the house of God in these days of strife and turmoil. Let us re- 
member, in sincere humility and deep gratitude, the goodness of our 
heavenly Father to us, in committing to us these great riches, these 
great graces and powers which are found in this Church. 

God help us to walk through this life with bowed heads and 
broken hearts. God help us to trust in Him, and hold fast to the iron 
rod, that through His mercy and His power, we shall receive salvation 
and exaltation in His kingdom, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER HEBER C. IVERSON 

(President of the Northwestern States Mission.) 

Two thoughts expressed by our beloved President in his opening 
address, and emphasized by nearly every speaker who has followed, 
are these : A call to repentance and greater diligence in keeping the 
commandments of the Lord, and an appreciation of changed condi- 
tions in which our motives and the results of our efforts are better 
understood and are bringing, forth merited praise. 

Notwithstanding the fact that in the past we have been, and at 
present are being, basely misrepresented, yet the light of truth has 
pierced the darkness, and many honest-in-heart are beginning to recog- 
nize us as we are and not as we have been falsely reputed to be. 
Among those who have been thus favorably impressed with our 
achievements, the fruits of the gospel, are men of eminence. You who 
were present at the opening session of this conferenc heard the words 
of three distinguished visitors who spoke on that occasion. These are 
three educators of high standing who spoke ; one, Doctor Carver, 
of Harvard University, Professor of Political Economy, who said in 
substance that were he looking for a people among whom the pro- 
cesses were going on under which a great nation is built, among the 
Latter-Day Saints is the one place in the world where one can see this 
in operation in the field itself. The other two noted scholars, Doctor 
Clark, President of the University of Nevada, and Doctor Lory, Presi- 
dent of the Agricultural College of Colorado, spoke also in terms of 
high commendation and praise. 

A book which has recently been written by one William E. Smith, 
which book bears the title, City Homes on Country Lanes, has much 
to say of the "Mormon" Colonization experiences. Among other state- 
ments the following appears: "Utah is a monument to leadership — 
to a quality of leadership that has been creative and inspiring. This 



ELDER HEBER C. IVERSON 



129 



leadership has been generally attributed to the 'Mormon' Church, 
and justly so. It is often said, 'Yes, the Church could do it but 
nobody else could do it.' " It is a shallow remark, based on the most 
superficial knowledge of "Mormon" institutions. Leadership is 
leadership, and great as is the "Mormon" Church, it is a very small 
thing when compared to the government of the United States. 

The writer appears unconscious of the secret of this superior 
leadership. He seems to think it lies in the kind of form of organi- 
zation, and is unconscious of the real source of power whence it eman- 
ates. 

Doctor Thomas Bicknell, for many years president of the Nation- 
al Education Association, great writer and philanthropist, after pay- 
ing high tribute to the educational achievements of our people, con- 
cludes his statement with these splendid words : "The vitality and 
force of all societies and organizations founded on Christianity lies 
in the self-sacrifice of its adherents. No other church, no other or- 
ganization, can produce such manifestations of self-sacrifice as that 
shown in the 'Mormon' missionary system." 

Our missionary system is truly a source of power, a marvelous 
work and a wonder. You may recall the words of the Lord to the 
prophet Isaiah recorded in the 29th chapter of the book bearing his 
name, in which the Lord foretells the coming forth of the Book of 
Mormon. Following this wonderful prediction He says, "For inas- 
much as this people draw near me with their mouth and with their 
lips do honor me, but have removed their hearts far from me, and 
their fear toward me is taught by the precepts of men, therefore I 
will proceed to do a marvelous work among this people, even a marve- 
lous work and a wonder, for the wisdom of their wise men shall per- 
ish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid." 

From the midst of the deep distress, following the terrible world 
happenings of the past few years, men are crying for superior, aye, 
for inspired leadership, because they have come to recognize the fact 
that human wisdom is wholly inadequate to solve the mighty problems 
of the present and future, and herein we see the fulfilment of the 
Lord's words I have just quoted from Isaiah. The wisdom of the 
worldly wise has perished, come to naught, and the understanding of 
their prudent men is hid in overwhelming uncertainty and distress. 

Many eminent characters have spoken in high praise of the 
fruits of "Mormonism" and many popular magazine writers, within 
the recent past, have written very complimentary articles concerning 
our people. In 'fact it appears they are vieing with one another in 
declaring our virtues. I fear that herein lies great danger to us for 
we are but human and liable to think ourselves great, forgetting the 
source of our strength, the secret of our greatness. Here the words 
of Apostle Paul are apropos, he says: 

"I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago (whether in the 
body, I cannot tell, or whether out of the body, I cannot tell; God knoweth;) 



130 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



such an one caught up to the third heaven. And I knew such a man, 
(whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knowfcth;) 
how that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words,, 
which it is not lawful for a man to utter. Of such an one will I glory: 
yet of myself I will not glory, but in mine infirmities. For though I would 
desire to glory, I shall not be a fool ; for I will say the truth : but now b 
forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to 
be, or that he heareth of me. And lest I should be exalted above measure 
through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn 
in the flesh, the messenger of Satan 'to buffet me, lest I should be exalted 
ajbove measure. For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might 
depart from me. And He said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee : 
for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will 
I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me." 

Whatever strength or power we possess has its foundation in 
humility and devotion. The greatest among us are always the most 
humble. Among the many glorious sayings of the Master is this: 
"He that would be greatest among you, let him be servant of all." 
In a revelation given to the Prophet Joseph Smith found in the Doc- 
trine and Covenants, section 121, the Lord reveals in plainness the 
source of real power, the path to true greatness and glory. Speaking 
of the holy Priesthood, which is the power of God delegated to man 
he says: 

"Behold, there are many called but few are chosen. And why are they 
not chosen? Because their hearts are set so much upon the things of this 
world" and aspire to the honors of men, that they do not learn this one 
lesson — That the rights of the Priesthood are inseparably connected with 
the powers of heaven, and that the powers of heaven cannot be con- 
trolled nor handled only upon the principles of righteousness. That they 
may be conferred upon us, it is true; but when we undertake to cover our 
sins, or to gratify our pride^ our vain ambition, or to exercise control, or 
dominion, or compulsion,, upon the souls of the children of men, in any 
degree of unrighteousness, behold, the heavens withdraw themselves; the 
Spirit of the Lord is grieved; and when it is withdrawn, Amen to the 
Priesthood or the authority of that man. Behold! ere he is aware he is 
left unto himself, to kick against the pricks; to persecute the Saints, and to 
fight against God. We have learned, by sad experience, that it is the nature 
and disposition of almost all men, as soon as they get a little authority, as 
they suppose, they will immediately begin to exerice unrighteous dominion. 
Hence many are called,, but few are chosen. No power or influence can or 
'ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood, only by persuasion, by 
long-suffering, by gentleness, and meekness, and by love unfeigned; by 
kindness, and pure knowledge, which shall greatly enlarge the soul without 
hypocrisy and without guile, reproving betimes with sharpness, when moved 
upon by the Holy Ghost, and then showing forth afterwards an increase 
of love toward him whom thou hast reproved, lest he esteem thee to be 
his enemy; that he may know that thy faithfulness is stronger than the 
cords of death; let thy bowels also be full of charity towards all men, and 
Ito the household of faith, and let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly, 
then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God, and the doc- 
trine of the Priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as the dews from heaven. 
The Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion, and thy scepter an 
unchanging scepter of righteousness and truth, and thy dominion shall be 



ELDER HEBER C. IVERSON 



131 



an everlasting dominion, and without compulsory means it shall flow unto 
thee forever and ever." 

Here we discover the source and secret of whatever real power 
or greatness we possess, the manner in which it may be obtained, and 
the manner in which it may be lost. The most destructive of all 
agencies is selfishness ; such as inspired the rebellion in heaven, and 
which manifests itself in a lesser degree in a thousand different 
ways by mortals on earth. One of the most common expressions 
of selfishness is the one against Which the Lord sounds a signifi- 
cant warning. I fear that, too frequently, we consider what our 
efforts in this work will mean by way of "honors of 'men/' of 
self glorification; if so, we violate the spirit of this revelation, and St 
is truly Amen and Amen to our power and Priesthood. The Lord has 
said, "Whsoever shall exalt himself shall be abased, and he that shall 
humble himself shall be exalted." Again, "Whosoever will lose his 
life, for my sake and the gospel, shall find it." I take it that these 
words are equivalent to saying that whosoever will lose self in the 
Lord's great cause, consecrate every energy of his being, every sym- 
pathy ot his soul, to its up-building, and, that with an eye single to 
the glory of God, shall find eternal life in His kingdom. 

"Let thy bowels also be full of charity towards all men and 

let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly then shall the Holy 

Ghost be thy constant companion." What a glorious possession to have 
the Holy Ghost as a constant companion. This Divine companionship 
is wholly contingent upon our absolute chastity of mind and charity 
of soul. 

How timely these instructions, "let virtue garnish thy thoughts 
unceasingly," for the world is truly in the midst of a veritable mael- 
strom of immorality. During the past decade, especially since the great 
world war, there has been a decided weakening of moral fibre through- 
out the world. 

In conclusion, may I repeat some ringing words spoken this morn- 
ing to the officers of the Y. M. M. I. A. by our worthy General Super- 
intendent George Albert Smith. Speaking of our moral standard he 
declared that second only to murder is unchastity. He also repeated 
some very impressive words spoken to him in his boyhood days by 
his illustrious father. His father said, "Son, if an evil-minded man 
were to come into your home for the purpose of assaulting your 
mother or sister, you would protect her honor, her virtue, with your 
life. And just so, I would have you defend the honor and virtue of 
every other woman, for she is the daughter of some father and mother, 
and the sister of some man." 

May virtue garnish our thoughts unceasingly that we may be- 
queath to posterity a most wholesome influence, and if possible, a 
definite disposition toward a positive disapproval of all that is inde- 
cent and immoral, whether upon the movie screen, in literature, in 
music, or in dress, for it is everywhere to be found. It is Satan's 



132 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



trump card, and should these demoralizing agencies succeed as he 
hopes they will, inevitable destruction will come to individuals and 
nations who abandon themselves to his vices. 

May the Lord help us to maintain the high moral standards 
vouchsaved unto us by our faithful parents, that we may be among 
the Saviors on Mount Zion, not alone in this our beloved na- 
tion but throughout the world, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem, "The Heavens are telling." 

ELDER GEORGE W. McCUNE 

(President of the Eastern States Mission.) 

I have sat in fear and trembling so far throughout every session 
of this Conference lest I might be given this opportunity of talking 
to you, and then to come to this final session knowing that I would 
be expected to talk, and here be compelled, by our beloved brother, 
President Bennion, to keep silent until the last, has almost made a 
nervous wreck of me. Therefore, I beg of you, brethren and sisters, 
sustain me by your faith and prayers that I may say nothing which 
will mar the sweet spirit which has prevailed throughout our entire 
Conference. I know that we have been blest of the Lord with a rich 
portion of His Holy Spirit, without which we could not be fed with 
the bread of life. 

Many great truths have been spoken upon during the various ses- 
sions of this Conference and I desire to say a hearty amen to all of 
them, and for one I have a sincere desire in my heart to try and carry 
out in my daily life these valuable instructions given by our leaders. 

One of our visiting educators, I think it was Dr. Clark, of the 
University of Nevada, who visited the first session of our Conference 
in the Tabernacle, Thursday morning, made a statement to the effect 
that science did not satisfy the soul of man and that it was essential 
that we keep our souls open and susceptible to spiritual instruction, 
in order that we may have soul satisfaction, and I know that this is 
true, and that the sincere seekers for truth, the world over, are fast 
finding it out. Scientific facts or truths which have been established 
beyond question do not disagree with revealed religion, and they are 
good, and we accept them, because all truth is a part of the gospel of 
Jesus Christ, but scientific theories are not truths, and may at any 
time be overthrown by the establishment of truth. Scientific theories 
are one thing today but may be quite a different thing tomorrow; 
hence, they do not satisfy the soul which hungers and thirsts for 
truth. 

During a recent visit to our Boston conference we were favored 
with the presence of one of our leading scientists, Professor Ralph 



ELDER GEORGE W. McCUNE 



133 



Chamberlin, formerly at the University of Utah, but now holding an 
important position in the great Harvard University, who gave us a 
wonderful talk, during which he made a similar statement to the one 
mentioned before, to the effect that all his labors and reserches 
in the laboratories of science, while very interesting, and to a great 
extent satisfying to the intellect, did not satisfy the soul of man, and 
that he yearned for something more. He bore a beautiful testimony to 
this effect, adding that he felt in this meeting a spirit which was soul- 
satisfying and bore testimony that he knew that ours is the true 
Church of Jesus Christ. 

My dear brethren and sisters, when we were baptized into this 
Church and received the gift of the Holy Ghost, we were given a 
most wonderful blessing, which, if cultivated and developed, will 
prove to be the source through which the soul may be fed and satis- 
fied, but it must be kept in tune to the great broadcasting station from 
whence all messages of uplift and good cheer are sent. Two weeks 
ago today I had the pleasure of dining with Brother David P. Howells 
and his family in New York. Perhaps many of you know Brother 
Howells. He formerly lived in Salt Lake City, and is one of our 
very successful young men, who by his course in life, is preaching 
the gospel daily to all with whom he Gome's in contact, because he 
follows out in his daily life the teachings of the gospel to a very 
great degree. After dinner had been served Brother Howells invited 
us into the living room where he showed us the wireless telephone in- 
strument which had recently been installed in his home, beside which 
was a program telling of the various messages of interest which would 
be broadcasted at certain hours of each day from the central station. 
Brother Howells preceded to make some slight adjustments by turning 
certain keys to the right or to the left, as he found it necessary, in 
order to put this instrument in strict tune to the central station. When 
this had been accomplished, behold beautiful strains of music burst 
forth in the room, very much clearer than the ordinary music box 
in which there is some metallic sound. It was not necessary for each 
one in the room to have something to their ears, but all could hear 
distinctly the sweet strains of music which were being played at the 
broadcasting station some twenty-two miles distant. This, of course, 
is a marvelous accomplishment of man's and I could not help comparing 
it with the divine instrument God placed in each and every one of 
His children entering into the world — an instrument which if kept 
in tune with our Father's Kingdom will bring to its possessor rich 
messages of love, encouragement, patience, gentleness, meekness, kind- 
liness and all the virtues and fruits of the gospel of our Redeemer. 
We might make a comparison of these matters at great length but 
suffice it to say, my dear brethren and sisters, that this divine in- 
strument within us is even more sensitive than the wireless telephone, 
it will easily be put out of tune by sin, either through acts of com- 



134 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



mission or omission. The little keys referred to on the wireless in-> 
strument which Brother Howells turned to the right or to the left in 
order to put the wireless instrument in tune with the great broadcasting 
station may be compared to the principles of the gospel which, if ad- 
hered to, will put us in strict tune with our Father's Kingdom, and 
should we find our instrument made discordant through sin, as in- 
dicated above, we can always turn to the glorious principle of re- 
pentance, of which we have heard so much throughout this entire Con- 
ference, and if we sincerely repent of our wrong doing, having com- 
plied with the other ordinances of the gospel, our Father in heaven 
will accept of our repentance and forgive our sins. 

I want to heartily approve of what our brethren have said re- 
garding this great principle of repentance. It is a fact that repentance 
is a gift of God and, as stated by our beloved President Penrose, 
there is a possibility of sinning away the time of repentance, for the 
Spirit of God will not always strive with man. It is indeed a sad 
spectacle to see one of our companions or associates who has been 
faithful for many years, fall by the way side, but, my dear brethren 
and sisters, it is a sadder sight to see one of such incapable of laying 
hold of this glorious principle of repentance, to find him lifted up 
in pride and justifying His actions. I say this is a far more serious 
condition than the fact of our sinning, because, as I have indicated 
already, our sins shall be forgiven through the glorious principle of 
repentance, but if we halve not lived or acquired this gift of God, 
there is no avenue through which our sins can be forgiven, we will 
go on through life justifying ourselves and thus sinning away the 
time of repentance. Now, we need to teach this principle in our 
homes. All great movements and reformations must begin at the fire- 
side. We must put our own house in order first, then we can, with 
good grace, cry repentance to the world. 

In the remarks of President Ivins, we heard regarding condi- 
tions throughout the world as to disrespect for law and order which 
are indeed appalling; as Latter-day Saints we must be zealous in 
guarding against such evils. The most effective way, in my estima- 
tion, to guard against evil will be, first, to show by our actions abso- 
lute respect for all constituted authority in our conversation and in 
our lives, not only the ecclesiastical authorities, the authorities in 
our Church, but all c onstituted authority ; municipal, state, or national, 
let us learn the joy of upholding and sustaining them. Do not let us 
be guilty of indulging in destructive criticism. Someone has said, 
we must first learn to obey orders before we attempt to give orders. 
We must certainly learn to first uphold authority. I for one certainly 
intend to take to heart these splendid instructions and go from this 
Conference with a greater determination to repent of my sins if I 
have been guilty of showing any disrespect for constituted authoritv. 
I have learned to love the brethren of the Church, those who preside 



ELDER GEORGE W. McCUNE 



over us, and I find' great joy and satisfaction in honoring and sus- 
taining them and I also find a feeling of genuine pride in seeking 
for and talking about the good acts of our civil authorities. On the 
other hand, I always feel a sort of unworthiness if I have indulged 
in unjust criticism of any constituted authority. Someone has said 
of our people, that we are like the blind leading the blind, and yet it 
is a fact that within our Church there is the greatest opportunity for 
individual development. 

This Church organization is designed to develop and cultivate 
the talents of each and every individual in it, and it will do so to the 
extent that such individuals will respond to the opportunities af- 
forded them and respond to responsibilities placed upon them. In the 
the various organizations of man. it is the custom to have a select 
few designated to do the thinking, preaching, speaking, writing, and 
so forth, hut this is not the case in the Church of Jesus Christ. Our 
heavenly Father instructs each and every one of His children how to 
live their individual lives and make the most of their opportunities. Now 
my brethren and sisters, these deplorable conditions of disrespect for 
law and order and morahty are of the world, and we are in the 
world and must be prepared to fight and withstand the onslaught of 
Satan's hosts for he will tempt our young people and lead them away 
in the most alluring fashion. While we are far from perfection I am 
indeed happy to know that we are above most of the world morally 
and I hope we shall continue to maintain this lead and improve upon 
it. The Gospel of Jesus Christ as revealed to Joseph Smith in latter 
days has certainly given to the world high ideals for their salvation, not 
only morally but intellectually and physically as well as spiritually. 

I will relate a little incident which happened in Utah during the 
recent war, which illustrates to my mind the status of Latter-day 
Saints morally. When our splendid young men were being called to 
the Colors there was a good mother who accompanied her son to the 
railroad station to bid him farewell. Just before the departure of 
the train, on which this young man must leave home, his mother 
looked him straght in the eye and said, "My boy, your country has 
called you into service. I want you to go like a man and do your 
full duty. Honor and respect those who are in command. Be faith- 
ful to every trust placed upon you, and if your country shall require 
your life, be . a man and give the same, for I could stand to see you 
come home in a box if it should be necessary. God grant that it will 
not be, but there is one thing I want you to promise me. I could not 
stand it to have you come home contaminated with the sins of the 
world. Therefore, I want you to come back to me clean, or come back 
not at all." 

I believe, my brethren and sisters, that this is the sentiment of all 
Latter-day Saints. We have all been taught from infancy that it is 
better to lose our lives than to lose our virtue and chastity. We can 



136 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



not get away from these fundamental principles of morality, and it 
behooves the younger generation to instil the same integrity into the 
hearts of our children as did our fathers and mothers before us. If 
we can but live this one principle of the gospel, the principle of moral- 
ity, and live it strictly, through this great law we shall be able to 
redeem the world, but should we fail to stand apart from the world 
in this respect, history will repeat itself upon us, as well as the rest 
of the world, which shows that when a people become immoral, they 
degenerate, and destruction is inevitable. Let us go from this Con- 
ference, my brethren and sisters, with a determination in our hearts 
to live better lives and to seek the Lord in mighty prayer that we 
may have wisdom to teach our children the principles of morality, and 
impress them upon their minds so that they will feel that it is better 
to lose their lives than to lose their virtue. It is a difficult task to 
rear our children to be different from their neighbors, but we must 
try earnestly to keep them from indulging in the excesses of the world. 
Some of the brethren have mentioned during the Conference the evils 
of modern dress. I feel that it is the extremes that harm and are 
not proper. We are taught to be a moderate people in all things and 
this applies to dress, to our eating, to our language and all our conduct 
in life. There is indeed a great responsibility upon us and I sincerely 
pray that we will be equal to the occasion and not fall into the sin 
of indifference as regards the duties of life. This is the greatest evil 
we have to contend with ; the sin of indifference. It is appalling to 
find the condition of the world as regards their attitude toward re- 
ligion and toward our duties in life. We ought to realize full well, 
my dear brethren and sisters, "Life is real, life is earnest, and the grave 
is not its goal. Dust thou art, to dust returnest was not spoken of the 
soul." There is much for us to do, every moment is precious and we 
are all hastening on to the end. "Our hearts, though strong and brave, 
still like muffled drums are beating funeral marches to the grave. We 
know not when the end will come but we know it will come in due 
time, and great will be our joy and satisfaction if we have striven 
hard to learn the purpose of our being here in mortal life, and of try- 
ing to magnify the same to the satisfaction of our heavenly Father. 

I was deeply impressed by the sweet rendition by the choir of the 
beautiful anthem, based upon the scriptural reference, wherein the 
Savior said : "Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, 
and I will give you rest," and wherein, He went on to say, "For my 
yoke is easy, and my burden is light." My dear brethren and sisters, 
I know that if we accept the gospel of our Redeemer with full purpose 
of heart, and live up to its teachings with faith in God, we shall find 
the words of the Savior to be true and correct that His yoke is easy 
to bear and that His burden is light. 

I earnestly pray that God will bless you all that we may try earn- 



ELDER GEORGE W. McCUNE 



137 



estly to understand the purpose of life and seek to magnify our duties 
to the very best of our ability, and I humbly pray for this blessing in 
behalf of all of us, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER SAMUEL O. BENNION 

(President of the Central States Mission.) 

Only those who stand before great audiences like this can feel 
what it means to occupy the time of the meeting. One is always re- 
minded that the responsibility that rests upon those who are assigned 
any duties in this Church is great, and that unless the Lord comes to 
to rescue these duties cannot be adequately discharged. 

I have been much impressed at this conference, I think more 
than ever before, by the fact of the divine appointment of the leaders 
of this Church. I think I have never recognized more fully the pow- 
er, the inspiration, that rests upon the President of this Church and 
his counselors, and the twelve apostles, men who have been appointed 
and ordained in the time in which we live, to lead Latter-day Israel. It 
is to me a great testimony, to; listen to the inspired! doctrine and teach- 
ings of Christ, manifested through these men. 

I have been reminded of two or three passages of scripture per- 
taining to our pre-mortal state. The Lord, in speaking to Jeremiah, 
as recorded in the first chapter, told him that before he was born 
he knew him, and ordained him a prophet unto the nations. In the 
Pearl of Great Price, we find more scripture which proves the divine 
appointment of men who take part in the administration of God's work 
in the earth. 

The Lord revealed unto Abraham some things pertaining to us 
in this life, and in the language of Abraham I read : 

"Now the Lord has shown unto me, Abraham, the intelligences that 
were organized before the world was, and among all these were many of 
the noble and great ones; And God saw these souls that they were good,, 
and He stood in the midst of them, and He said : These I will make my 
rulers; for he stood among those that were spirits, and he saw that they 
were good, and he said unto me: Abraham, thou art one of them; thou 
wast chosen before thou wast born." 

The Lord told Abraham that with him were many of the noble 
and great ones, whom He would make His rulers. The world be- 
lieves not in the ante-mortal state of men, according to the teachings 
of their churches and their ministers. They halve not arrived at that 
knowledge, because they have not obeyed the law upon which that 
blessing is predicated, for it is a great and glorious blessing to a man 
or a woman to obtain a knowledge, while they sojourn in the flesh, that 
before they came here they lived, and that God organized intelligences, 
and established them, so that when they should come into the earth, 
some should be His rulers ; not particularly the riders of nations, but 



L38 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the rulers of His Church, in the day that His Church should be in 
the earth, for he says, "These I will make my rulers.'" These men 
were tried, and proved to be the spirits, among others, who were able 
to be leaders of men ; and before they were born in this earthlife, in 
the clays of their "primeval childhood," when they were "nurtured at 
his side," in immortality, the God of our Fathers and their fathers 
had given unto them their calling; and we have thousands of people 
who stand in the midst of Israel, as also many who have passed away, 
who can testify, and do testify, that the leaders' of this Church were in- 
spired men, who were called and ordained to be his rulers in the 
day and age in which they were to come on the earth. 

The history of Joseph Smith is evidence to this people, that he was 
and is a prophet of the Living God, and impresses even those who do 
not believe with evidence of his leadership. We find no greater* 
leadership in all the world than in this "Mormon" Prophet, who la- 
bored early and late, unceasingly, to establish in the minds and hearts 
of men that faith and that knowledge which he had received in his 
communication with the Father, the Father of all the children of men 
who have to be reached in the flesh, and with Jesus Christ. He gave his 
life for the testimony which he bore, that he had seen the Father and' 
the Son, and that they had revealed unto him the true order of wor- 
ship. And as the world grows older, men and women of all countries 
will become acquainted with his work and with his character, and they 
will point to him as being the man who was a leader of men ; and 
when they recognize that he was a leader of men, then the power of 
the Almighty will rest upon them, and they will recognize in him a 
leader of God's people here in the earth. Then will they begin to re- 
member the Lord, and will begin to come unto him in repentance, and 
will finally come unto Him in His kingdom. It may take unto eter- 
nity before the truth, that has been preached to them while here in the 
flash, shall pierce them, but except a few who may reject it, all will re- 
ceive it ultimately. 

Now I want to say a word' about Brigham Young. How many 
people have given consideration as to what it took to build that Temple 
on this block, to lay those mighty stones, to plan that mighty edifice? 
I think there are but few in the Church today who can properly es- 
timate what one of those stones weigh, and what it took to build that 
great structure. I question very much if any of us have given it 
sober or serious thought. None but a man moved upon by God could 
build such a building. It stands there as a monument, and will stand 
as a monument, that Brigham Young was and is a prophet of God, 
and that God did inspire him. You know when he stood at the head 
of the Church he preached the gospel with as much power as any 
prophet has ever done. Men asked him how he was going to build the 
temple. He said, "The Lord has shown unto me the pattern of the 
temple, and I know what it shall be like, and how to builcf. it." Those

words of his are there in granite. That is evidence to this Church and 
to the world that he was a leader of men, a mighty man, and a glorious 
character, one who was ordained, and one who stood in the midst of the 
Gods when these rulers of the Church were chosen. Brigham Young- 
was among them. So was the Prophet Joseph. So was John Taylor, 
who also gave his life, offered it in Carthage jail when Joseph and 
Hyrum fell martyrs, and who gave up their lives because of persecution 
many years later, when he stood at the head of this great Church. 
Wilford Woodruff was there. Lorenzo Snow was there. Joseph F. 
Smith was there. Heber J. Grant was there. God said, "These I will 
make my rulers." And you who have the testimony of Jesus, you 
who have received the knowledge that this latter-day work is true, 
you know, in your own hearts, that these men were and are leaders 
of God's people in the great work He has established upon the earth. 

As I listened to President Grant, at our opening session, tell the 
people what they should do, and what he had done for them 1 in the 
way of establishing them more firmly in their industries, so that they 
might pay their debts and live as becometh the people of God, and as 
He intended they should, there was testimony in his heart, the testi- 
mony and words of the living Redeemer shone forth in his counten- 
ance. The living God governs the words and testimonies of his serv- 
ants as they come upon the earth, just as he counseled with them when 
they stood among the spirits and knew them to be the men that He 
would have them to be. 

God, our eternal Father, through His Son Jesus Christ, has 
proved to the world that he has never made a mistake with the men 
that He has called to lead Israel ; from the days of Adam until now. 
He has chosen men that He knew> before their worldly career, who 
would come forth in time, and be the leaders of men, and He said 
through Paul, the Apostle, that He hath determined the times before 
appointed, and the bounds of their habitation. And Moses tiells 
us, in Deuteronomy, that the "nations of the earth were divided ac- 
cording to the number of the children of Israel," and Israel was known 
of the Lord, and leaders of Israel were recognized by Him because of 
their ability to carry on His work. Why was Jeremiah ordained a 
prophet? Because God knew who he was, knew that he was a pro- 
phet because of the power that he had received through observing the 
laws of the gospel of Jesus Christ before the world was. God knew 
that he would be, in his day and in his time, when he should come 
to the earth according to appointment, a prophet of the living God, and 
one in whom the Lord could repose confidence, because of his stability, 
strength, power, life, and love for His work. 

I want you Latter-day Saints to go home, with this feeling in 
your hearts that he who leads this Church is a man divinely called 
and associated with men who are duly appointed to act in the name 
of God, and who have the power to ordain others ; and that through 



140 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



them comes revelation for the guidance of this Church, for the preach- 
ing of the gospel, for the redemption of mankind; that they are chil- 
dren of our Father, called by our Father to be leaders of the children 
of men before they lived upon the earth. A man will make no mis- 
take who follows them, and receives their advice, and who keeps the 
commandments of God. 

I heard President Grant say, recently, that he would consider it 
a favor to him, if men and women would abstain from the use of tea 
and coffee, tobacco, liquor, and coca-cola; that they would have 
power given them to establish themselves in the faith, and save them- 
selves from debt, sickness, and disease. And he read from the reve- 
lations, that the destroying angel would pass them, by; and he is a 
prophet of God. 

Read in the scriptures ; in them is life and light and the power that 
leads back unto God, our Father. A shor-t time ago, I asked; the) branch 
presidents and conference presidents and each missionary in the Cen- 
tral States mission, to take up a labor with the members of their 
branches, and with every member of the Church with whom they 
came in contact, encouraging them to read the scriptures, not only in 
preparation for their lessons for auxiliary organizations, but separate 
and apart from that — to read the scriptures one-half hour a day. I tell 
you if men and women will do this the Lord's truth will come into 
their minds and into their hearts, and they will remember constantly 
the word of God, and will avoid the pitfalls that are everywhere 
present to entrap those who have a knowledge that this is the Church 
of God in the earth, and that there is none other through which salva- 
tion to the human family can come. May God give us the power to be 
true to his work I humbly pray in His name. Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem, "God's refuge and strength." 
Benediction was pronounced by Elder Joseph A. McRae.

ELDER RULON S. WELLS 

(Of the First Council of Seventy) 

I am quite sure that we have all been impressed by the remarks 
of our brethren on the great increase of crime and sin in the world 
at large and the growing spirit of lawlessness — disregard for the laws 
of the land. This spirit is so prevalent that it even menaces the safety 
of our own great nation, say nothing about the other nations of the 
world. When I read in the newspapers that th4 lawless elements are 
gaining control of the offices, both executive and judicial, in our great 
cities, appointing police and judges friendly to their criminal enter- 
prises, and contemplate the general disregard for law and order now 
threatening our municipal governments in the leading cities of our 
fair land, it occurs to me that we are living in perilous times, "when 
iniquity shall abound"^ — in the days that we read about in the 'scrip- 
tures, and concerning which the Savior of the world said, when He had 
been asked to give to His apostles the sign of His second coming and 
of the destruction of the world: "For then shall be great tribulations, 
such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, 
nor ever shall be. And except those days should be shortened, there 
should no flesh be saved ; but for the elect's sake those days shall be 
shortened." These impending evils, iniquity, and sin, that are so ram- 
pant in all the world cannot fail to have some effect upon us, for we 
are more or less in contact with that world of sin. The Latter-day 
Saints ought to> be in complete accord and harmony with every move- 
ment that is made to combat the progress of sin. We say to every 
organization and to every man who lifts up his voice and stretches 
forth his hand to stem the tide of evil : "You are engaged in a glorious 
work. God bless you in every such undertaking." But of all these 
agencies — and there are many of them — there is only one that is ade- 
quate to overcome the sin of the world, and that is the gospel of the 
Lord Jesus Christ administered by the Church of our Redeemer estab- 
lished in the earth for that express purpose, that we might overcome 
this world of sin. How may we then properly equip ourselves to meet 
the arch enemy of God and his legions that are abroad in the world, 
luring men and women away from the path of rectitude into the paths 
of sin and down to degredation and destruction? How can men and 
women be properly equipped in order that they may combat evil when 
the enemy shall make an attack upon them individually ? For even the 
elect are not safe, but it is comforting and pleasing to contemplate that 
we shall not have to endure the great trials and tribulations that shall 
come to the world for any great extended length] of time, because, we 
are told, "for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened." Were, it 
otherwise, no flesh would be saved. It matters not how strong we may 
feel ourselves to be. 

It matters not what position we may occupy in the Church or out 
of it. No man is so safe that he may boast of his own strength, but only 



142 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



as God shall be our strength and come to our rescue, and then shorten 
the days, will we be able to overcome, and finally gain the victory ; at 
least, that is the way I read the holy scripture. And what is the 
equipment? Can, you, then, or can I. or can any human sou' in all the 
world, combat and overcome the temptations of the present day in and 
of ourselves without being properly equipped for that great struggle? 
I answer "No, we cannot." We need the help of God. We need the 
companionship or His Holy Spirit. Without these we cannot succeed. 
And how shall we obtain that help ; and how secure this holy compan- 
ionship? Through obedience to the gospel of Jesus Christ: Faith in 
God and in His only Begotten Son — faith in the efficacy of His redeem- 
ing blood that was shed for the sins of all mankind ; through sincere 
repentance from sin : with a broken heart and contrite spirit exercise 
our own powers of resistance. Then be baptized by immersion for the 
remission of sins by a servant of God who has been endowed with 
power from on high, divinely authorized to perform that holy ordinance. 
Then, and not until then, may we receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, 
without which no man can overcome the sins of the world. The Spirit 
of God will not dwell in an unclean tabernacle. The gift of the Holy 
Ghost cannot be secured until our sins have been washed away by bap- 
tism, through the atoning blood of the Lamb of God. 

This is the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. This is the equip- 
ment that every soul must have, if he shall combat the sins of this 
world and overcome them. So we say to all the world : Repent and 
be baptized, every one of. you ; believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and ac- 
cept of Him as the very Son of God, who gave His life to overcome 
death and the grave and redeem mankind from their fallen condition. 
Do this that you may receive the Spirit of the Lord and thereby be 
prepared to fight the good fight of faith and overcome the power of 
the adversary. Let me say further, that "Except ye repent, ye shall all 
likewise perish." Oh, ye inhabitants of the earth, wherever you may be, 
turn to the Lord and repent of sin and accept of the atonement of the 
Lord Jesus Christ. Let me say to Latter-day Saints, repent of yuur 
sins, be they great or be they small, accept the counsels that are given 
to us. from the presiding authorities of the Church, and if we have com- 
mitted sin, be it great or small, let us turn to the Lord. If we have 
failed in the payment of our tithes and our offerings, if we have 
failed in the observance of the Word of Wisdom, let us repent and 
turn away from nt gleet of duty. If we have in any way offended the 
Lord or done aught amiss, let us turn to Him throught repentance, and 
He will forgive and grant us His Holy Spirit that we may not lose its 
companionship, for we need that companionship every day of our 
lives that we may be prepared to meet the enemy wherever he may 
assail us. 

The only adequate means of combatting the sins of the world, 
then, is obedience to the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the only 
edequate agency is His Church which, on account of a universal apostasy, 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS 



143 



was withdrawn from the world, but, thanks be unto Him, has again 
been restored to the earth through the instrumentality of the Prophet 
Joseph Smith. It is the only Church endowed with power from on 
high authorized to administer the saving ordinances of His gospel, 
including the bestowal of the gift of the Holy Ghost without which 
not even the elect can hope to gain the victory. 

Then, beware of sin, oh, ye sons and daughters of Zion ! Adhere to 
the faith of your fathers ; secure for yourselves the companionship of 
the Holy Spirit ; keep yourselves unspotted from the sins of 
the world, for the adversary is seeking your destruction. Art unvirtu- 
ous youth or maiden is like fruit without flavor, or the flower that 
hath no fragrance, or the salt that hath lost its savor, "thenceforth good 
for nothing but to be cast out and to be trodden under foot of men." 

Through the laying on of hands by a duly authorized servant of 
God the Holy Spirit is conferred upon us as a gift from God. This en- 
titles us to its constant companionship, but only so long as we retain 
the remission of our sins, and this we may retain by virtue of our 
baptism, just so long as we continue in the good fight of faith, and if 
we endure unto the end of our lives then shall 1 we gain the victory over 
sin, notwithstanding our many weaknesses and shortcomings. 

God bless the Latter-day Saints. May they grow in the knowledge 
of Him, and in good works. Good bless thei youth of Zion. Shield and 
protect them from the power of evil. May they not fall into by and for- 
bidden ways. God bless His children everywhere, the honest in heart 
in every land, and lead them into His fold. May they, through obedi- 
ence to His gospel, secure the remission of their sins and the glorious 
companionship of His Holy Spirit. And may we all, thus equipped for 
the battle of life, gain the victory over sin and secure unto ourselves 
the crown of eternal life and unto Thee, O Lord, we will give the 
honor and glory through Jesus Christ. Amen.

ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN 

( Of the First Council of Seventy, and President of the ; 
California Mission-) 

It is certainly a very great privilege, as well as a great responsi- 
bility, to stand before this great congregation. I sincerely hope that 
the 1 few moments I occupy this position I may be prompted by that 
good spirit which has been made manifest in the remarks that have 
been made by the presiding authorities of the Church during the 
meetings of this great conference. I have felt impressed, while 
listening to the valuable instructions imparted, with the testimony 
of the member of a stake presidency that I listened to several years 
ago when I was attending a stake conference. He had just returned 
from attending the general conference of the Church, and he stated 
that he had been in attendance at the general conference for fifty-two 
years. When he returned from this particular conference his people 
inquired as to the character of the conference and how he had en- 
joyed himself. He answered by saying that it was the greatest con- 
ference he had ever attended. Then the children laughed and said: 
"Why, father, we have heard you say that after every conference, as 
long as we can remember." I have been attending conferences my- 
self forabout forty years, and I think I may go back to the people of 
the California mission and say, in all truth and sincerity, that this 
conference has been most enjoyable; that the instructions that have 
been imparted, from my point of view, have been as valuable, that the 
manifestations of the Spirit of the living God have been as great in 
the teachings imparted to the people, as any conference I have ever 
attended. I thank God for a religion of this character; that after 
long years of listening to the instructions and testimonies of the pre- 
siding authorities of the Church, there is such light, and' power in the 
gospel of the Redeemer of the world that the hearts of men and 
women are made just as glad in the work of God, after they have 
listened to these instructions for a lifetime, as when they first heard 



ELDER JOSEPH IV. McMURRIN 



147 



the glad tidings of great joy. I don't know that there is anything else 
in the world just like "Mormonism." It surely is the power of God. 
It is the fulfiling of the prophecies that have been given through an- 
cient prophets in days gone by, and if any man can come into 
this great congregation and listen to the character of instructions im- 
parted by the presiding men of the Church, and look into the faces 
of the hosts of Israel who have come up from the East, and the West, 
and the North and the South, that they may be more perfectly in- 
structed in the ways of God, and not feel that this is a marvelous 
work and a wonder, and a fulfilment of the predictions of the proph- 
ets in relation to the latter-days, then I can only say that he would 
be in evei;y way contrary to my own view and contrary to the con- 
victions of my own soul. 

I am glad, my brethren and sisters, to be a missionary, and glad 
to say to the fathers and mothers who have sons and daughters in the 
California mission, that those sons and daughters are doing honor to 
their parentage. It is really a wonderful thing to witness the develop- 
ment that takes place with these missionaries, and yet it is true that 
they are weak men and weak women and they feel very keenly their 
weakness. Still, through the blessing and power of God, they are con- 
vinced of the truth of the gospel and they are made to comprehend, 
by the unerring guide of the Holy Spirit, the truth of the religion re- 
vealed of the Lord in the dispensation in which we are living, just 
as fully and completely as their fathers and their mothers have been 
made to know that truth. 

I was thrilled in my soul, just a short time ago, in attending a 
priesthood meeting of the missionaries in the San Francisco confer- 
ence, to hear a young sister say — and she said it in the fear of God and 
under the inspiration of the Spirit of God — "I never knew that 1 
was alive until I came into this mission." I talked, not long ago, 
with a young man who has been and is a stock-raiser, and has been quite 
prominent in connection with this business, and he said to me, "Presi- 
dent McMurrin, I have never taken as much pleasure in watching 
my flocks and my herds, and in witnessing the increase in their 
numbers, as I have taken here in striving to preach the doctrines of 
the everlasting gospel. I have never found any joy in connection with 
my personal affairs that could in any way equal the joy that I have 
experienced as I have tried, to the best of my ability, to communicate 
to men the message of the gospel that has been committed into my 
hands, and I have never been half as anxious over any of my wordly 
possessions; I have never prayed about them to the same extent that 
I have prayed about the responsibility that rests upon me as a preacher 
of righteousness." 

I am glad to say that the sons and daughters of the Latter-day 
Saints who are laboring in the California mission are laboring there 
under the inspiration of the Spirit of the Lord. There may not be 
anything of a very remarkable character transpiring, and yet there 



148 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



is something remarkable transpiring, for the message of the gospel of 
the Lord Jesus Christ is being delivered to the people of that mis- 
sion, and that message is the power of God unto salvation. The de- 
livering of the message, bearing witness to the truth, will have its ef- 
fect in due time, for the Lord God Himself has promised that the de- 
claration of His word, as it is spoken by His servants, shall never 
fall to the ground without bearing fruit, and I am a believer in the 
promise that has been made in relation to these matters. 

We have recently had the pleasure, in California, of having with 
us President Heber J. Grant, Dr. John A. Widstoe and Bishop Charles 
W. Nibley, and' of having the President dedicate a chapel at San 
Bernardino. That name ought to have interest to the Latter-day 
Saints. President Brigham Young, in the early settlement of this 
great section of the country, sent pioneers into California. There is 
a story related that he said that when they found a mountain with a 
mark upon its side of an arrow-head they should pitch their tents. I 
don't know whether he ever said anything of the kind or not, but it is 
represented, at least in Railroad literature, and in other ways, that 
such a declaration was made. But be that as it may, those people 
pitched their tents in the section where San Bernardino now stands, 
and upon the mountain side there is the perfect picture of an arrow 
head, and it has been made as you know the emblem of the Salt Lake 
Route. Owing to the coming of the Johnston army, these early 
pioneers were called back home, and from that time, from that day up 
until the present time, we have had no real foot-hold in San Bernar- 
dino ; and, of course, our hearts are glad and we praise the Lord God 
of heaven in the fact that we are now privileged, through the minis- 
try that is being carried on in California, to establish a splendid little 
chapel that has been dedicated to the Lord our God by the President 
of the Church. We have come to believe that some of the things that 
possibly illumined the mind of President Brigham Young, long ago, 
may yet take place in that region of country, and we have recently 
thought it to the advantage of the work of God to establish a confer- 
ence, with headquarters in San Bernardino. We have also been suc- 
cessful in establishing a conference with headquarters in the city of 
Fresno, where we have had but little opportunity in the past to pro- 
claim these glad tidings of great joy. There is a great multitude of 
people, three hundred fifty thousand strong, in the Fresno conference, 
who know just about as much regarding the principles of the gospel of 
of Lord Jesus Christ as if they lived in some far-off, distant land ; and 
the missionaries, who are operating at that point, have joy and glad- 
ness in their souls, because of the success that is attending their minis- 
try. And so we might continue to speak of San Francisco, and to 
speak of Los Angeles, and to speak of San Diego, and to speak of 
sections of Nevada and Arizona where these young boys, in their 
weakness, and yet with joy in their hearts and with confidence in the 
call that they have received from the servants of God, are lifting up 



ELDER JOSEPH IV. McMURRIN 



149 



their voices according to their ability, calling men to repentance, and 
bearing witness, under the inspiration and power of the Holy Ghost, 
concerning the truth of the everlasting gospel? 

We had the privilege, while President Grant was visiting, to go 
out to Long Beach, where the civil authorities had given the "Mor- 
mon" choir of Los Angeles, Long beach, and Ocean P'ark the oppor- 
tunity of singing The Martyrs in their great auditorium, and it was 
packed to its capacity. They say there were six thousand people 
present. 

Elder Axel A. Madsen, the conference president, delivered a con- 
cise and comprehensive story in relation to the martyrs, the character 
of men they were, and the causes that led up to their martyrdom. 
Under the inspiration and Spirit of God he was enabled to present 
things of very great importance, and I take it there are many men 
who heard what he had to say, as well as who heard the singing of 
the choir, who will remember favorably something concerning "Mor- 
monism." President Grant had the opportunity, I am glad to say 
also, before that great congregation, of saying a few words in appre- 
ciation of the kindness and liberality of the authorities in Long Beach. 
Permission has now been granted us by the commissioners of Balboa 
Park to meet there. Balboa Park is the park that housed the buildings 
of the great fair during the International Fair that was held at San 
Francisco and San Diego, and they have there a great open air organ, 
and permission has been given to the choir of Southern California 
to go and sing The Martyrs to the people of San Diego, and the 
privilege also of using the great organ that was erected during the 
fair period. We had the privilege, some time ago, in Long Beach of 
singing The Vision to a great host of people, four thousand or five 
thousand strong, when Elder Everard McMurrin had the blessed priv- 
ilege of bearing record to the truth of the gospel of the Lord Jesus 
Christ and expounding in clearness and force the nature of that great 
first vision, and what was to come to the inhabitants of the world 
as a result of it. While we do not see great things transpiring, our 
hearts are made glad in what is taking place, and your sons and your 
daughters know that the Lord has spoken. They know that the gospel 
of the Redeemer of the world, as revealed to Joseph Smith, is the 
power of God unto salvation, and they have the courage to tell the 
people, according to their power and ability, the gospel message. God 
bless the sons and daughters of ZTon, and establish them for ever 
and for ever in that form of religion which is indeed and of a truth 
the Power of God, the only means of salvation to a perishing world. 
Amen. 

A sacred solo was sung by James H. Neilson, "Thus shall Thy 
light shine forth."

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ELDER CHARLES H. HART 

(Of the First Council of Seventy) 

We have been pleased and instructed by the sweet music, and 
thrilled by the testimonies of our brethren, and deeply, and I trust 
abidingly impressed by the timely instructions given during this con- 
ference. In the keynote speeches by the First Presidency we had 
presented to us the gospel of temporal salvation, scriptural philosophy, 
(concerning which not yet all of the elders of the Church are fully 
informed,) and then we had presented to us some of the great national 
problems. President Ivins, in speaking upon the latter topic, challenged 
our attention to the question as to whether or not it was sensationalism 
for him to say what he did, and while he spoke there went forth from 
the city of New York a press dispatch giving information that Police 
Commissioner Enright had advised the organization of, and was organiz- 
ing, New York City as a sort of armed camp, with a dozen armed private 
citizens, upon each block, to come forward at the call of the officers, 
because there had been in ninety-three days as many spectacular mur- 
ders committed in that great city. While President Ivins spoke, there 
came from Chicago an account of five murders in the past forty-eight 
hours, and an account of a letter received by Mr. Kickham Scanlan, 
whom Brother Ivins mentioned, the Chief Justice of the Criminal 
Courts of Chicago, who recently called upon the people of Chicago to 
know whether they were going to degenerate into a race of yellow men 
or not, or stand by the enforcement of the law. Justice Scanlan received 
a letter from some of those whom he had offended, because he had said 
that gun-men and thugs headed local labor unions. The letter received 
was to the effect that he would be "bumped off," to use the language 
of outlawry ; that he might sing it, hum it, or whistle it, but an armed 
guard could not be with him always, and his life would be forfeited'. 
Time will tell whether the threat will be carried out. 

This same Chief Justice Scanlan, a few weeks before, had been 
called upon by a notable organization held in the city of Chicago, the 
officers of the N. E. A. which represented in a way some seven hundred 
thousand school teachers of the United States. They desired to 
know of the Chief Justice of the criminal court the cause for outlawry, 
and he assigned the passing of the old-fashioned home in which religion 
was taught, and a disbelief in God, lack of faith in God, as the reasons, 
and said that no finer institution existed than the old-fashioned home- 
stead where religion was taught. There were others at the N. E. A. 
who discussed some of the problems that our nation is concerned with, 
and that we as a people, as a religious body, and as American citizens, 
are interested in. 

There was Professor Edward A. Ross, the sociologist of the Wis- 
consin University, who declared that the formula for making boys and 
girls worth living with was as well understood by sociologists as the 



ELDER CHARLES H. HART 



151 



formula for the manufacture of soap, and after giving some of the 
elements he declared that the crowning formula of all was religion. 
He noted, by the way, and we will disagree with him on that 
point, that about the ages of seventeen or eighteen years of age was the 
time to begin to teach religion. We well know that we must start at an 
earlier age, but this same sociologist, while agreeing that religion was the 
crowning factor in his formula, said that the preachers or the clergy 
had greatly exaggerated what they had to offer; a charge, perhaps, 
growing out of his experience with such representatives of the clergy 
as he was acquainted w,ith. , 

And there was Professor Frank E. Spaulding, Dean of the Grad- 
uate School of Yale, who spoke also at that organization in reference 
to education, quoting Sir Aukland Geddes, the British representative, 
who had recently declared that the very end of education was to turn 
out pupils with minds which saw things in a certain color. And then 
Professor Spaulding asked : "What color ? What is the color of the edu- 
cation in the United States ?" And he said it was true that it contained 
certain pigments, had in it the pigments of patriotism, honesty, sincerity, 
truth, goodness, courage, cheer, generosity, humility, sympathy, love for 
humanity, for justice, law, and order. "But what of the color itself," 
he asked, "the deep absorbing, overwhelming color of our public edu- 
cation ?" And he declared that it was "individual success through individ- 
ual effort, a desire, a determination, for individual achievement, and this 
desire, this determination, is overwhelmingly, almost universally focused 
upon ideals of material achievement and material prosperity." And 
then he asks the question if that sort of coloring is satisfactory, and 
declared that it was a problem for the deepest thought of our statesmen 
to answer whether that sort of coloring in our education is satisfactory. 

Mr. Tigert, the United States Commissioner of Education, also 
made a speech in which he said : "Unless along with these so-called 
high-t>row subjects, we can teach honesty, justice and decency, we'd 
better dismantle our finely equipped educational institutions and gO' back 
to the old log schoolhouse." And he quoted from a noted ecclesiast, 
who said : "I would rather have my boy in heaven learning his A, B, C's 
than I would have him in hell reading Latin and Greek." He declared 
that it was a great discovery in surgery, the sharp knife, but it was a still 
greater discovery, the clean knife, sterility ; and he would rather have a 
dull knife, if clean, thp^n the sharp knife if foul. 

These are some of the problems that concern the American 
people. Such statesmen as William Jennings Bryan and others are not 
satisfied with the sort of education being given to our boys and girls. 
It was a source of satisfaction to me to hear the discussion at the 
Universitv of Utah the other day, and I would place along with the 
paner that has been mentioned as delivered by Dr. Carver, the paper 
delivered by Dr. Georse Thomas stating the policy of our chief educa- 
tional institution. I think these companion documents should be in the 



152 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



homes of our people, and for consideration of our boys and girls. It 
is of great importance, that sort of coloring that they have in their 
education. , 

One of our greatest scientists, Pascal, in speaking of belief in the 
immortality of the soul, declared that : 

"All our actions and thoughts follow paths so different, carrying accord- 
ing to the hope of gaining eternal blessings or not, that it is impossible 
to take any sensible or judicious step without regulating ft from thfis 
standpoint, which must be our final object." 

The great statistician, Babson, in a convention of business men at 
Pittsburgh a few years ago, speaking on this question of law and order, 
which is a problem now with our large centers of population, said this : 

"If you gentlemen are assuming that it is the police and government 
that preserve law and order in this nation,, and create the conditions of 
safety in which you live and do business, you are mistaken. It is the 
church which makes this nation safe." 

Many educators have been quoted during this conference on the 
question of religious training. Mr. Butler, the President of the 
largest University in our land, defines education as having to do with 
man's spiritual environment, and he uses the term spiritual in a very 
broad sense, having to do with man's art, man's science, his literature, 
his institutional life, and last, but not least, with religious training. 

But the problem is how to give this religious training. I rejoice that 
we are solving it so far as the Church is concerned, in our religious 
instruction at home, and in our Church schools, and in the seminaries 
for boys and girls who are pursuing studies in the high schools, colleges 
and universities. 

I appreciate the importance of our auxiliary associations. I would 
not detract from the impressive picture Brother Roberts gave of the 
importance of the Boy Scout movement; and yet, after all, it is but an' 
auxiliary of which there are many in the United States, such as Weed 
Craft League of America, headed by Mr. Ernest Thompson Seton, 
and the Father and Sons' League, and the Big Brother and 
the Big Sister Federations, the De Molay movement, and the 
Camp Fire Girls, Girl Scouts, our Bee Hive Girls; and just 
lately we heard of another organization of the girls connected with 
our Primary, the Seagull Girls. But all these, after all, are but auxiliary 
to the training which must be given in the home. Mr. Thomas Nixon 
Carver has been liberally quoted from in this conference, and it is 
indeed refreshing to hear stated some theological principles after being 
transmuted into the terms of the political economists. For instance, he 
defines truthfulness as a labor saving device, and proves it. Altruism 
for practical purposes he defines as being a good sport. We know altru- 
ism, however, in a higher form than that, as evidenced by our temple 
work, and also the vast amount of work being done for humanity, such 
as indicated by the reports of our mission presidents. 



ELDER CHARLES H. HART 



153 



There is just one extract I would' like to read from Dr. Carver's 
The Religion Worth Having, as to the sort of boys and girls he 
would have in a church that is able to hold its place in the nation and to 
comply best with the first great command to multiply and replenish 
the earth, and subdue it. He says : 

"What attractions does the fellowship of the productive life offer? To 
young men it offers days of toil and nights of study. It offers frugal 
fare and plain clothes. It offers lean bodies, hard muscles, horny hands, 
or furrowed brows. It offers wholesome recreation to the extent necessary 
to maintain the highest efficiency. It offers the burdens of bringing us 
large families and training them in the productive life. It offers the obli- 
gation of using all wealth as tools and not as a means of self-gratification. 
It does not offer the insult of a life of ease or aesthetic enjoyment, or 
graceful consumption or emotional ecstasy. It offers instead the joy of 
productive achievement, of participating in the building of the Kingdom of 
God. 

"To the young woman also it offers toil, study, frugal fare and plain 
clothes such as befit those who are honored with a great and difficult task. 
It offers also the pains, the burdens and responsibilities of motherhood. 
It offers the obligation of perpetuating in succeeding generations, the 
principles of productive life made manifest in themselves. It does not 
offer the insult of a life of pride and vanity. It offers the joj of achieve- 
ment, of self-expression, not alone on dead marble and canvas, but also in the 
plastic lives of children to be shaped and molded into those ideal form-; of 
mind and heart which their dreams have pictured. In these ways it offers to them 
also the joy of participating in the building of the Kingdom of God." 

In conclusion may I quote the prayer of parenthood which is just 
now being presented as a text for this year to the Parents' Classes : 

"I thank Thee. O God, for being, 

For WHAT, and for WHY I am; 

For wedded companionship without end; 

For a life blended with lives that through me come — 

Help me, O God, to know these lives as they are: 

To companion them each day and hour, 

To live before them that faith that carries on, and on — 

e3i|®. toward divinity. 
That mine may be that joy unutterable — 
A sweet, uplifting presence to each life through mine, 
And unto Thee be all praise forever. Amen." 

ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 

(Of the First Council of Seventy) 

I have been helped spiritually by the testimonies that have been 
given at this conference. It is good to hear men tell of God's goodness 
to them : it is stimulating to listen to words that bear witness that God 
lives. The world needs the spirit of inspiration and testimony, and it 
is necessary that we as servants of the Lord be ever ready to explain 
the message of our Savior Jesus Christ in a broad and comprehensive 
manner. The other evening I was asked if "Mormonism" is to solve 
the problems of the world from an economic viewpoint. I was in con- 



154 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



versation at the time with a prominent American educator who had 
spoken at the University Club on the conditions of civilization today. 
He had explained that the behavior of mankind is measured by economic 
principles and ideals. If these principles are high, then the solution 
of the world's problems will be correspondingly good. If they are 
wrong, then the world will go to pieces, and civilization will decay. 
He cited Russia as an example of where a people have tried to bring 
about reform in adopting economic ideals of a low standard. To the 
question as to whether or not the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints is to solve the problems of humanity from an economic view- 
point, I answer that the religion of the Master is a pure religion, and 
holds that the spiritual life of man is above all things, and that the 
suffering of humanity can only be eliminated as humanity humbly 
and courageously approaches the work and problems of life with a 
supreme faith in God. We must come back to a fundamental truth 
which I sometimes fear we are forgetting, and that is the fact that 
Vv-e are all naturally blessed with a consciousness of what is righl and 
what is wrong. We must cultivate this consciousness and choosing 
the right as God gives us the power to see the right, fearlessly live 
and preserve the better moral life of our natures both individually 
and socially. 

Nineteen centuries have passed since the Savior of the world 
uttered the ringing admonition, "Go ye into all the world," and yet 
the majority of mankind are unsaved. Almost a thousand million of the 
race perish in the life of each generation without the gospel, which 
is the only force after all that can re-generate mankind. In answer 
to the question, then, "Will 'Mormonism' solve life's problems from an 
economic viewpoint?" I reply YES. But only as the gospel of Christ 
in its purity affiliates itself through men of wisdom with the practical 
affairs of life. We have reached a crisis in the history of the race when 
but the universal spread and triumph of the gospel can save the world 
from dire disaster ; for in the gospel is wrapped up the solution of all 
the industrial, financial, political, social, and moral problems of the age 
with which philosophers, statesmen, and philanthropists are hopelessly 
struggling. I ask : "Is not the call a clear one to us who have the 
gospel, and understanding its regenerating and transforming power, to 
teach mankind how to apply it in making over mankind, and transform- 
ing institutions by this divine agency?" 

Let me give you an example of how "Mormonism" has contributed 
to the solution of the social problem of mankind. No one will deny 
the fact that the idealism of Christianity is the highest known to 
humanity. And when it comes to government, the principles of the. 
Government of the United States are the most democratic and idealistic 
ever worked out by statesmen. The "Mormon" Church has brought 
people of twenty-seven different nationalities together and, uniting 
them in a common purpose, has caused them to look to the highest 



ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 



155 



ideals religiously and politically. When a society is united on the same 
principles of life and are agreed to the same ideals, it is a demotic type, 
as the Socialists express it. The gospel of Jesus Christ tells us that 
every man must work out his own salvation, and develop the individu- 
ality which God has ■blessed him with. This is the greatest of all rights 
and privileges in life, and we should learn to appreciate it. The highest 
ideals can only be attained by our looking to God for divine guidance, 
and by our working every day with faith in ourselves and confidence 
in our fellow men. The fact that one morning, God the Father and His 
Son Jesus Christ spoke to the little boy Joseph Smith and gave him the 
divine message as to what he was to do to direct the children of men 
back to the Throne, is the lesson which teaches that mankind must come 
back to God and recognize His Godship over all. < 

We have in this congregation a delegation of Japanese who are 
passing through our city. They are welcome to these services, and I 
hope they will be able to understand much of what is said this after- 
noon. A great Japanese poet once explained in one of his poems that 
every man is a part of the "light of the Great Light," and the gleam 
of his soul will ever be the directing influence into the Great Light. 
In one sense, this is our philosophy, for Joseph Smith, recognizing the 
gleam of "Light" in his soul, went to the "Eternal light" and asked for 
more knowledge, and he was answered. It was as you state in your 
philosophy, the gleam that is in the soul of man, participating in the 
greater light that brought us into being, "but this light is embodied 
in God, and His Son, Jesus Christ, personages, beings, individuals 
as you and I are. 

I have been asked what compromises "Mormonism" will make with 
the world? I reply, no compromise when it comes to the fundamental 
principles of religion, for they are of God, and no one has a right 
to compromise the eternal truths of God. They belong to Him. We 
have no right to say we will compromise with man. So I pray that 
we may hold up these eternal truths. There is no compromise in God's 
principles and holy laws. There can't be, they are of God ; and we have 
seen the "gleam," and we must follow the "gleam" according to the 
will of God for all His children. 

The Lord help us to see these things and to keep straight to the 
path, loving all men as individuals. I have hopes for the world, and 
while I agree with everything that has been said from this stand, I 
know you agree with me in the statement that there are great truths 
being established by men in the world, that there is goodness in the 
world, there is sweetness and light in the hearts of humanity. God help 
us that we may unite on all these powers for right, that the power of 
light may overcome the power of darkness. Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ELDER JOHN WELLS 

(Of the Presiding Bishopric) 

While listening to the advice we have received during this confer- 
ence. I thought of that passage of scripture : "My soul doth magnify 
the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Savior," for I do re- 
joice that we are permitted to meet here in such pleasant surroundings 
and under such auspicious circumstances, blessed with the privilege of 
listening to instruction and advice given by our brethren, under the 
inspiration of the Lord. I realize what a blessing it is to have this 
privilege. What a glorious blessing it is to feel the power and influence 
of the Holy Spirit, under which we make new resolves and determi- 
nations to better serve the Lord. There is something in "Mormonism," 
commonly so-called, or the gospel of Jesus Christ, that forces every one 
of us, when under its influence, to think better, to act better and to 
make new resolves. 

We have been told to hold the gospel's standards high ; to keep 
the commandments of the Lord ; to pay our tithes and offerings ; and to 
remember the poor. All of these instructions, if carried out, will 
develop in our hearts the spirit of unselfishness and devotion to our 
fellow men. No one can perform a good act or a service for the Lord 
but what he rids himself of some selfishness. I often meditate 
on the great commandment given by our Lord and Master: "Thou 
shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, 
and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And 
the second is like unto it. Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." 
This commandment is practically the sum and substance of the gospel of 
Jesus Christ, and His great work will roll forward just in proportion 
to the measure that we grasp that fact and live it. We cannot possibly 
separate the love of God from the love of fellow men. The more 
we love God, and the more we try to serve Him, the more we shall love 
our fellow men ; and the more we shall desire to labor for our Master. 
We cannot separate our religion into two parts, to be forgotten in wordly 
affairs and to be remembered on the Sabbath day only. Every Latter- 
day Saint who has in his heart a desire to love God and to keep His 
commandments, must, at the same time, love his fellow men, and this 
great body of Latter-day Saints demonstrate, as no other people on 
this earth have done, the force and power behind the great command- 
ment of our Lord and Master, and the sacrifice and labors of the Latter- 
day Saints for the love of their fellow men. This is almost beyond 
comprehension. 

When I listened to the President give out the report of temple 
work, I thought to myself : "It would take a thousand years for one 
person to do all the work that has been done in the temples for the dead 
in one year." Then, when we remember the twenty-five thousand 
ward teachers who visit the homes of the Latter-day Saints every 
month, going in humility of heart with a message — not a scolding or 



ELDER JOHN WELLS 



157 



fault-finding — but a message of uplift, of love, of kindness and of help- 
fulness ; we realize what service and love of our fellow man means. 
Then, there are the sisters of the Relief Society, acting as visiting teach- 
ers, going from home to home, laboring week in and week out, gather- 
ing small funds for the poor and for other social purposes, leaving 
their blessing, their sympathy, and the influence of the Spirit of the 
Lord in the homes they visit. Then, we must remember the seventy 
thousand brethren in the Church, holding offices in the Priesthood, 
from patriarch to deacon, who are trying to exercise the Priesthood 
given unto them to teach others by example and by precept the gospel 
of our Lord and Master. . Our critics are still groping about to find 
fault with the work of the Lord. They will not lift up their heads to 
see the good we are doing. They are very much like the picture I saw 
in my early days in an edition of John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress, 
in which an angel stood over a man in poverty who was raking the 
gutters with a muck rake, trying to find something valuable there, while 
there stood over him the angel who had a crown for him if he would 
only look up for it. The world is in the same condition today in 
relation to the Latter-day Saints. They have not made up their minds 
that good can come from Nazareth, after all. 

My brethren and sisters, we must be prepared to give sweetness, 
kindness and helpfulness and to develop the highest type of com- 
munity life among the Latter-day Saints. By this I do not mean the 
cooperative movement that prevails in the world, by which one great 
organization, under the name of cooperation, is developing this 
movement through stores, for the movement is nothing more than a 
protest against their competitors, and is still the competitive system of 
living. Such methods only aggravate the class distinction that is grow- 
ing so pronounced. The cooperation the Latter-day Saints should have 
is that of sympathy and love, kindness and helpfulness, improvement of 
homes, farms, and all working with that ideal of the common 
good in mind, with that neighborly spirit that is so well under- 
stood among the Latter-day Saints. This spirit of helpfulness in 
community life will rid us of our selfishness, whether it be com- 
mercial or otherwise. 

My brethren and sisters, let us pay our tithes and offerings, and 
let us remember the poor ; let us have sympathy for those less fortunate 
than ourselves, and let this sympathy be of a practical kind ; let sweet 
neighborliness grow in our communities, for, after all, a sweet home life 
is the greatest help to the community. I was examining the United States 
census a few days ago. It shows that a majority of the people of the 
United States live in the great centers of population. The drift, all 
through the United States, is toward the cities. We are not growing 
in the cities, but we are growing in our semi-rural and farming com- 
munities. We are growing in our little towns and hamlets, where the 
sweetest home life and the finest development take place.

May the Lord bless us that we may magnify our callings, honor 
our Priesthood, serve Him wi h full purpose of heart, and ail oth r 
things will be added to us. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang the hymn, "Come, come, ye 
Saints." 

ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 

(Of the Presiding Bishopric) 

I am sure that as good as President Grant is with figures, he 
would have a difficult problem in trying to- determine how much blood 
my heart has pumped during this day, and judging from the feeling 
that came over me when my name was mentioned, the first two seconds, 
my blood was pumped to a froth. 

I remember, a number of years ago while on the train, listening to 
a discussion between President Lorenzo Snow, President George Q. 
Cannon and President Joseph F. Smith. They were discussing their 
missionary experiences and trials that had come to them in their 
missionary work. To my surprise at that time, they agreed that the 
hardest thing they had to do was to occupy this position. Having 
listened to each of them, preach wonderful sermons, I could not under- 
stand how this could be, but I can now say that I have lived to appre- 
ciate, in a modest way, their feelings, and I believe I have learned that 
it is a virtue to be desired rather than avoided. For I have discovered 
that when a man acts in and of himself, in his own strength, he makes 
mistakes, but when God acts, he makes no mistakes, and He has prom- 
ised His children that if they humble themselves before Him, His 
blessings will attend them, and I have found in my short experience 
nothing that will humble one so effectively as being called to this 
position. 

Merciful and gracious is the Lord, and marvelous is His work. 
Blessed, indeed, are those of us who have been permitted to take upon 
us His name, and covenant with Him through the waters of baptism 
that we are willing to serve Him, that we appreciate the opportunity 
He has given unto us of again returning into His presence, to enjoy 
the blessings promised the faithful. While I attended a convention 
in the East a few years ago, this statement was made: 

"Our experience in Europe with the army has taught us that today the 
people have no love for the old conventional religion. Instead there are 
selfishness and pettiness. We must do away with the false social distinc- 
tions and create a church ideal, fit for our present need, one with social 
aims worth fighting for, not a mere selfish gospel of safety. Let them 
lift up the center faiths of the Christian life, let them practice as well 
as preach fraternity, and draw together in one common cruse." 

I want to say to you that in God's Church we have a perfect fra- 



ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 



159 



ternity. When men learn to live as God would have them live, then are 
selfishness and pettiness done away with ; but as long as men continue 
to be selfish and petty, and jealous, then we cannot hope for the perfect 
Church which God would have. This is a most wonderful work in 
which we are engaged, and when we learn to obey, when we learn to 
depend upon God, to take Him at His word, and prepare to receive 
His blessings, then can we expect the promise. 1 learn a lesson from 
the stories we read in the Scriptures concerning the preparation of men 
who have been called to positions of responsibility in this Church 
and in the Church of God anciently. Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, 
Daniel and David, were trained in their youth. They were prepared 
in their youth, the foundation was laid for the work that would be 
required of them later in life. The Savior had that experience, and in 
this day Joseph Smith, in his youth, — having been born of goodly 
parents, having been taught to have faith in God, finding a difference 
of opinion in his home, his parents not agreeing as to which church 
was the church of God, went to the one place where he could reason- 
ably be expected to go to receive the information "he needed. Believing 
in the Scriptures, having faith, not wavering, he went to God, and hav- 
ing complied with the condition the promise was fulfilled. God the Father 
and Jesus Christ, His only begotten Son, appeared to Him. God 
the Father, all-powerful, fulfilling His promise, appeared to the boy 
who, through faith and having complied with the condition, was 
worthy. But what was the reply when asked which of all the churches 
was true? "This is my beloved Son, hear Him." God might have 
answered in further detail but with Him there is order in all things and 
this was the mission of His Son. 

Later, the Angel Moroni, whose mission it was to bring forth the 
Book of Mormon, which was to open the gate to this, the last dispen- 
sation, was sent to counsel, to watch over, to help prepare the boy for 
the work that he was to do. Later, John the Baptist came to fulfil his 
mission, it being his right under the direction of Peterjames and John 
to restore the Aaronic Priesthood, which Priesthood holds the keys of 
the preparatory gospel, the gospel of faith, repentance and baptism by 
immersion for the .remission of sins. Then came Peter, James and 
John who held the right and the power to restore the holy Melchizedek 
Prieshood, and then the Prophet Elijah who came to turn the hearts of 
the fathers to the children and the children to the fathers, lest the whole 
earth be smitten with a curse. 

Oh, I thank God that there are in this Church, as President 
Ivins said, young men who are willing to take upon them the burden of 
this work, who are willing to labor with all their might for the up- 
building of God's Kingdom on earth, and I know that there are thou- 
sands of them in the Church today who can say, as David of old said : 
"Who is this Philistine that he should defy the armies of the living 
God?" And then, when ridiculed because of- their youth, because of their

inexperience, they can answer as he answered : "Thy servant kept his 
father's sheep, and there came a lion, and a bear and took a lamb' out of 
the flock : and I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out 
of his mouth ; and when he arose against me, I caught him by his bearJ. 
and smote him, and slew him. Thy servant slew both the lion and the 
bear, and this Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath defied 
the armies of the living God." 

Oh, my brethren and sisters, the burden that is resting upon us at 
this time is that we shall continue to impress upon the hearts of those 
young men that Spirit, that we shall find work for them to do, that they 
shall feel the glory and the joy of service, and when we are laboring, 
as it is expected that we shall labor, when we humble ourselves as it is 
expected we shall humble ourselves, then will the deacons in this Church 
be laboring as deacons, assisting the bishops in caring for the meeting- 
houses, and looking after the poor. Then will those who are ordained 
to the office of teacher watch over the Church always, and be with 
and strengthen them, and see that there is no iniquity in the Church, 
neither hardness with each other, neither lying, backbiting, nor evil 
speaking; then will those who are ordained to the office of priest 
be prepared and be willing to preach, teach and expound the principles 
of the gospel. 

We are told that "the field is ripe and ready for harvest." "Where- 
fore the voice of the Lord is unto the ends of the earth,- that all that 
will hear may hear. Prepare ye, prepare ye, for that which is to come, 
for the Lord is nigh, and the anger of the Lord is kindled, and his sword 
is bathed in heaven, and it shall fall upon the inhabitants of the earth, 
and the arm of the Lord shall be revealed, and the day cometh that they 
who will not hear the voice of the Lord, neither the voice of His serv- 
ants ; neither give heed to the words of the prophets and apostles, shall 
be cut off from among the people." 

Oh ye that embarked in the service of God, see that ye serve Him 
with all your heart, might, mind and strength, that ye may stand blame- 
less before God at the last day. God so grant, I numbly pray, in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER CHARLES W. NIBLEY 

{Presiding Bishop of the Church) 

My heart and my soul are in entire sympathy and harmony 
with the doctrines and precepts and counsel and admonition and 
spirit of this great conference. I know that the men who stand at 
our head, the Presidency of the Church, the Apostles, the Patri- 
arch, the Seventies, and the Bishopric — you may exclude me from 
God. There may have been, doubtless have been, in times past, one 
God. There may have been, doubtless have been, in times past, one 
here and there, more distinguished as a leader, more fitted, as 



ELDER CHARLES W. NIBLEY 



161 



President Ivins pointed out to us, for the work that they were 
called upon to do, than any others who preceded them or who 
have followed them; but in the history of this Church I don't 
believe there ever has been a band of brethren of general author- 
ities who are more desirous of serving the Lord unselfishly than 
the brethren that we now have who preside over the Church. They 
are men of God, clean of life and unselfish, and most devoted in 
their labors. They are men to whom the Lord manifests Himself 
and to whom He' gives guidance and direction, in the conduct of 
the affairs of the Church. 

The same may be truly said with respect to the authorities in 
the stakes, in all the stakes of Zion. As far as I know, the presi- 
dencies, high councilors, the bishops and their counselors are, as a 
rule, unselfish workers, and in the missions also, as well as the 
auxiliary organizations and, in fact, in all the activities of the 
Church everywhere, there are more faithful workers today who 
labor unselfishly for the upbuilding of the kingdom of God than 
there ever were up to this time ; so that the Church and kingdom of 
God is today stronger, more powerful, more potent than it ever 
has been in any hour of its history in the past. 

But notwithstanding all this, we are, Oh, so dreadfully weak 
in many things. We are not self-sustaining as we should be ; far 
from it. We are most woefully in debt. I have been thinking in 
these meetings this thought : I wonder what Brother Brigham 
would say to us if he could happen along here now and ascertain 
that we do not produce in our state more than about one-half of 
the meat that we eat! We ship in tens of thausandp: of hogs from 
other states instead of raising them here at home! I wonder what 
he would say after all the years of his teaching, which I heard 
and others here heard, and which you can read, that this people 
should become self-sustaining, and then find out that today forty 
to fifty per cent of all the eggs consumed by the people of this 
state are shipped in from the East, and the fowls that you go down 
in the market and buy are shipped in by the carload ! We do 
not produce them here where everybody, pretty much, who has a 
little piece of land could be producing a few chickens and eggs, 
and have, as Brother Brigham used to tell us, a pig or two, and 
thereby become self-sustaining. 

Then again, following the same thought, I wonder what 
President Smith wduld say to us if he found now that we are more 
in debt individually than we ever were before. We have not 
followed the wise counsels that have been given to us as we 
should have done. I plead guilty myself, and yet the Latter- 
day Saints as a whole are a good people. I believe in them. They 
are my people. I want to be with them. 

I see men here and there going away from this camp-fire of ours, 
going off with people who are not of our faith. They seem to find' hap- 



162 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



piness and enjoyment there, and I fear some of them have pleasures 
in unrighteousness. But for me, I like my own people best, for I be- 
lieve they are the Lord's people, and yet those of our friends and neigh- 
bors at these different campfires around us, they, too, are good 
people. 

I have an abiding faith in this Nation, which the Lord, our 
God, brought into being, and has brought to this day and age, 
standing as it does, doing a great work, a leader among nations for 
good, for helpfulness, for righteousness, for peace. President Grant 
noticed in his opening remarks the wonderful work that had been 
done, and commended it, by the recent conference held in the 
city of Washington, looking to the partial disarmament of the 
nations; that has been a great work and a good work. We might 
say, if they had only done that one thing, the return of Shantung 
with its thirty millions or more of Chinese to their own land, to 
their own country, returned them to their own government, if that 
alone was the only thing that had been accomplished, that alone was 
worth while. But many other great things have been accomplished, 
and I am proud of what our Nation is trying to do. 

We need not fear as to this Nation from without. The Lord has 
said, "I will fortify this land against all other nations." The dan- 
ger is not from without, but from within, as the Book of Mor- 
mon plainly points out from secret combinations of men giving 
their first allegiance to their secret combination. That is the dan- 
ger for after awhile these combinations will be contending one 
against the other until anarchy is apt to prevail, crime becomes 
rampant and danger to the existence of our government with its 
glorious Constitution is great, unless the people turn unto the Lord 
and seek Him. 

Our attention was called by a distinguished educator here the 
other day. to the fact that the great curve, as he called it. of 
mechanical development, invention of every kind, patents' being 
issued by the millions on all these inventions, which go on multi- 
plying by the thousands, the great mechanical development that 
makes this the most wonderful age in all the history of the world, 
that curve he said had gone way up almost out of sight, but he 
said the spiritual line or curve has not moved upward but rather 
downward, and he suggested that the people of this Nation should 
give more attention to the spiritual and less to the temporal. 

On the opening day of our conference, when I saw a larger 
congregation here than had ever met on a week day of any confer- 
ev:e before. T marveled at it. What is it? I thought, as this learned 
educator called attention to this lack in the spiritual growth, or 
development of spiritual matters, which is so sadly lacking in the 
wld, that here is this very thing that brings these thousands 
and tens of thousands together, this spiritual power which is lack- 
ing in the world. There isn't any use denying the lack of it in . the 



ELDER CHARLES W. NIBLEY 



163 



world. Indeed, it is not denied. It is confirmed. We heard it con- 
firmed tare the other day on the best authority, and we see it; 
we see the lack of it; we have heard it repeated in these confer- 
ences, the lack, as these men testify, such men as Nicholas Murray 
Butler and others from him on down, all testify to that lack in 
the world, but here is that spiritual power which has brought 
these tens of thousands together to this conference on a week day 
to listen to the servants of the Lord. That is the very power which 
the people of the world lack. For these thousands who come, do 
not come here to grumble and complain at the Priesthood. As a 
rule, they are clean men, good men. They are tithepayers. They 
are men who, generally speaking, keep the Word of Wisdom. But 
those who do not pay tithes, and who do not keep the Word of 
Wisdom, you will not find them crowding into this tabernacle on 
a week day, or on a Sunday even, not as a rule. It is those who 
have this spiritual essence and power in their souls, which these 
distinguished educators say, and which we know, the world lacks. 
'We have it here, and so we come to be refreshed and to learn 
of the ways of the Lord, and to partake of His spirit, and to grow in 
grace, and in the knowledge of the truth. 

■ A distinguished and learned man, a ruler among the Jews, and 
an educator, called on the Savior in his day and stated that he 
knew that the Savior had power which they did not have because, 
he said, "No man could do the works you are doing unless God 
be with you." Now the Savior said to him, "Except a man be born 
again he cannot see the kingdom of God." At that the distinguish- 
ed ruler, educator and teacher began to quibble and say : "Well 
now, how can a man be born again when he is old," etc., and the 
Savior replied, "Except a man be born of the water, and of the 
spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.'" 

He can secure for himself, by conforming to the law, this 
spiritual essence and power which shall make him to know God. 
Read in the Doctrine and Covenants how the conferring of the 
Priesthood was brought about, and how the power of the Holy 
Ghost which gives the key of the knowledge of God, was given 
through holy angels, conferring this Priesthood upon the Prophet 
Joseph Smith and his fellow-servant Oliver Cowdery. They re- 
ceived this power, this authority. They were delegated to confer 
it upon others, and when they laid their hands upon them and said, 
"Receive ye the Holy Ghost," then, mystery of mysteries, miracle 
of miracles, thev received it. And you also have partaken of that 
Spirit, my brethren and sisters. You have received it just as the 
Savior told this great teacher that he could receive it. The Savior 
said, "The wind iblowefth where it listeth,, |and thou hearest the 
sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither 
it goeth." We need not inquire further than to know that that power, 
that spiritual essence, is received when we comply with the condi- 



164 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



tions. The Savior said that no man could receive it without obey- 
ing. You know that is true. You have received, as T say, of this 
Spirit, and that is what brings you here. That is what gathers this 
great body of people every six months. That is what makes you 
to know that these brethren of the Presidency arc men of God, 
that these presiding officers are clean, good, upright men, compe- 
tent by the purity of their lives alone, to be entitled to communion 
with that Spirit and power called the Holy Ghost, and to receive 
direction and guidance from that source, and give it -to this 
people, and this notwithstanding our many little failings and weak- 
nesses which beset us in our lives. 

We can say, as Jesus said to this great teacher, Nicodemus, 
'Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and 
testify that we have seen ; and ye receive not our witness." The 
Latter-day Saints teach that which they know, and they say with 
the power of Almighty God, the power of the Holy Ghost, this 
spiritual existence, this spiritula missing force which the world is 
now finding out that it lacks, oh, so greatly, too, which they have 
not got and neither can they find it only in the Lord's way, "Ex- 
cept ye be born of the water, and of the Spirit ye cannot enter into 
the kingdom of God," neither con you know and feel assured of 
this spiritual essence and power which we possess, and which we 
know is the power of God unto salvation, without complying 
with this requirement. God Bless you. Amen.

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

PRAYERS ANSWERED 

My attention has been called to the fact that a resolution was passed 
here some time ago, recommending that a day be set apart for a general 
fast and prayer meeting among the Saints, to ask for the success of 
the great International Conference on the Limitation of Armaments. 
We thank the Lord that our prayers and those, undoubtedly, of the 
great majority of all the people in the United States, for the success 
of that conference, have been answered. 

AIM AND DESIRE OF THE GENERAL AUTHORITIES 

I believe that I am in a position to know, better than any other 
living man, the heart, the aspiration, the desire and the ambition of each 
of the twenty-six men who constitute the General authorities of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Starting with myself and 
ending with Brother John Wells, and without any mental reservation 
whatever, I announce to you that I believe — I not only believe, but I 
know, that each and every one of these men has his heart set upon the 
accomplishment of the purposes of God. While we all have our faults, 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



165 



our failings, our imperfections, our weaknesses, nevertheless there is 
no mental reservation in saying to you that these brethren, one and all, 
desire the advancement of God's Kingdom, and that it is first and 
foremost in their affections. When we become perfect we may not 
be able to stay here. 

AN APPEAL TO FATHERS AND MOTHERS 

Once I was able to quote the following stanza correctly, but I 
am not quite sure of it now : 

"Vice is a monster of such frightful mien, 
As to be hated needs but to be seen ; 
But seen too oft, familiar with her face, 
We first endure, then pity, then embrace." 

I can remember when a young lady walked the streets of Salt 
Lake with her dress high enough to show the tops of her shoes, and an 
inch or two more, that we were shocked ; but I have seen many a knee on 
the Temple grounds today, because the dresses were too short. Fathers 
and mothers, use your influence with your modest, pure, sweet girls 
who, in their anxiety to follow fashion, are causing men to blush with 
shame ! 

USE NO DRUG THAT CREATES AN APPETITE FOR ITSELF 

The head of the health department, Dr. Beatty, has requested me 
to say to the Latter-day Saints that, there are more injurious ingredients 
in coca-cola than there are in coffee, and particularly when some 
of the good people say : "Give me the double shot." I say to the Latter- 
day Saints, and it is my right to say it — because you have sung, since 
this conference started (whether you meant it or not, T am not 
saying)— 

"We thank Thee, O God, for a prophet, 

To guide us in these 'atter days ; 
We thank Thee for sending the gospel 

To lighten our minds with its rays ; 
We thank Thee for every blessing 

Bestowed by Thy bounteous hand ; 
We feel it a pleasure to serve Thee, 

And love to obey Thy command." 

Now, if you mean it — I am not going to give any command, but I 
will ask it as a personal, individual favor to me, to let coca-cola alone. 
There are plenty of other things you can get at the soda fountains with- 
out drinking that* which is injurious. The Lord does not want you to use 
any drug that creates an appetite for itself. 

A WORD TO FARMERS AND POULTRYMEN 

Fifteen years ago, yes longer than that, when I was presiding 
over the European mission, I remember reading an article on the. poultry 



166 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



industry, and I was dumb-founded to learn that the products of the 
poultry industry — eggs, chickens, ducks, etc., were greater than all 
the products of any other industry in the United States of America. 
Cotton was not "in it." Corn was not "in it." I would not be positive 
as to the figures, but my recollection is that in the state of Utah there 
were not two hundred thousand chickens, and in the state of Iowa 
there were over ten millions ; and yet, I believe we have as good 
feed for chickens here as they have in Iowa. I ate butter all the 
way from Denmark, when I went to Japan. We ought to export butter, 
but never import it. We ought to export eggs and chickens, but never 
import them. I have known of poultry coming in here by the car-load, 
which ought never to come. It is really almost a moral obligation on 
us to provide these things here at home. 

THE TESTIMONY OF THE GOSPEL FAR-REACHING 

We had at our Priesthood meeting here, two thousand three hun- 
dred ninety-eight men — lacked only two of two thousand four hundred 
men — the largest Priesthood meeting that has ever been held within my 
recollection, and in another six months it will be forty years since I 
first had the privilege of occupying this stand to proclaim, the gospel to 
the Latter-day Saints. I thank the Lord for that power and that 
inspiration of His Spirit which abides in the hearts of the Latter-day 
Sain f s, men, women and children. No other people like them ; no other 
people have the absolute knowledge that God lives, that Jesus is the 
Christ, that God has spoken, and that He did reveal Himself to the 
Prophet Joseph Smith. The testimony of the divinity of that man's 
mission has been given to people from the country of the mid-night 
sun, Scandinavia, clear away to South Africa. It has been given to 
men and women all over Europe, from Canada to South America, and in 
the islands of tne sea. The Japanese and Chinamen, and men all 
over the world have been blessed by Almighty God through His 
giving to them a knowledge that Joseph Smith was a prophet of the 
true and the living God. 

THE ABSENT BRETHREN OF THE GENERAL AUTHORITIES 

Brother J. Golden Kimball is not with us today on account of poor 
health. He is in San Francisco, or in the neighborhood of San Fran- 
cisco. Our prayers and faith go out for his recovery. With the excep- 
tion of Brother Kimball, the only members absent from this conference, 
of the twenty-six men standing as the general authorities of the Church 
are: Elder Reed Smoot, who is in Washington, and Brother Orson F. 
Whitney who is presiding over the European mission. Brother Whitney 
is accomplishing a wonderful work. I have read with the keenest 
interest some of his splendid editorials in the Millennial Star. T believe 
that it is needless, now, for me to say anything in praise of Elder Peed 
Smoot. From the President of the United States down, he is being 
commended for his splendid labors as a senator. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



167 



A MEETING OF STAKE PRESIDENCIES WITH THE GENERAL AUTHORITIES 

Now, I agreed to quit in thirty-five minutes, and I am through in 
ten, with one single exception, two exceptions ; maybe I will find three 
before I get through. I have found three. The Presidency and the 
general authorities desire to meet tomorrow morning at 9:30 in the 
Temple — en' race from the west door — all the presidents of stakes who 
are here at this conference, and their counselors. We will not promise 
to close that meeting till we get through. You know if you were at a 
picture show you could stand it for three hours without getting tired, 
but when you are in a meeting somewhere, you know it nearly kills 
you to sit a little over the regular time. 

PRAYER IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND IN THE FAMILIES 

I have here a note from Elder Stephen L. Richards, who is an 
attorney, and he says: "A notion seems to' be prevalent among educa- 
tional people that the offering of prayer in our public schools contravenes 
the law of the State. I believe a reputable legal opinion will not sup- 
port this view ; since provision is made for prayer in the Federal Con- 
gress, the State Legislatures, and other public assemblies, why prohibit 
prayer for the children?" 

President Brigham Young said: "Prayer keeps a man from sin, 
and sin keeps a man from prayer." We ought to have enough interest 
in our children to have prayers. I will thank the Lord when the public 
sentiment of America shall say that a man who c'oes not believe in pray- 
er cannot teach our children, at the expense of the public. Why should 
my money be used to employ a man to teach my children infidelity and a 
lack of faith in God? I remember as a boy, when we had our small 
common schools, that they hired a non-"Mormon," to teach in the 
Twelfth Ward school. He got up and said : "I understand that in the 
past you have prayed in this school. We will not have any more 
prayers, because we do not know whether or not there is anybody to 
pray to." I consider it an outrage that the money of people who be- 
lieve in the Lord God Almighty can be spent to teach our children 
that kind of ''rot." I endorse Nicholas Murray Butler's words, 
"The fool who says in his heart: 'There is no God,' finds his god 
when he is looking in a mirror." 

Mr. Babson, the greatest statistician in America, and be knows 
what he is talking about, says : "Much, of the prosperity of the nation 
is due to the family prayers which were once held in the homes of our 
fathers. To a very large extent, this custom has gone by. Whatever 
the argument pro and con may be, the fact remains that such family 
prayers nurtured and developed the spiritual resources to which the 
prosperity of the nation is due. The custom of family prayers should 
be revived, along with many other good New England customs which 
some radicals may ridicule, but to which they owe all they possess." 



168 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



HAPPINESS CONSISTS IN GIVING AND SERVING 

Those are the two things I nearly forgot. Here is the other. 
Henry Drummond has written some of the best essays, and has deliv- 
ered some of the finest speeches that I have ever read. In one of his 
books entitled, The Greatest Thing in the Word, he says: "Half the 
world is on the wrong scent in its pursuit of happiness. They think 
it consists in having and getting and in being served by other.s. It 
consists in giving and in serving others." The happiest men in the 
world are the missionaries who are giving the gospel free of charge 
to the people of the world. 

May the Lord sanctify all that has been said and done in this great 
conference. May He bless our organizations. I thank the Lord for that 
wonderful oratorio, "The Restoration," that came from the brain of the 
daughter, Susa Young Gates, and partly from the voice of the grand- 
daughter, Emma Lucy Gates Bowen, and from the inspired pen in writ- 
ing the music of the grandson, B. Cecil Gates — of the great man, Brig- 
ham Young, under whose direction was erected this building, and our 
great organ. May the Lord inspire us one and all who have a knowledge 
of the gospel to live it. May we obey the Word of Wisdom, because 
God tells us to, to say nothing about the advantages to ourselves by so 
doing. May we pay our tithing so that we will be on the right road 
to happiness, is my prayer. May we pray to God, so that we will have 
His Spirit ; may we live the gospel, so that we may inspire our children 
to do the same, I ask it, with my blessing upon you all, in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 
Amen. 

A selection from the Oratorio, "The Restoration," was given by 
John W. Summerhays, Melvin Peterson, Evangeline Thomas, and 
Martha Smith lensen, of the choir. 

The conference adjourned for six months. 

The benediction was pronounced by Elder Arthur W. Horsley, 
president of the Carbon stake of Zion. 

Professor Anthony C. Lund conducted the singing in the Taber- 
nacle, Professor J. J. McClelland played the accompaniments, inter- 
ludes, etc. on the great organ, assisted by Edward P. Kimball and 
Tracy Y. Cannon. Stenographic reports of the discourses were made 
in the Tabernacle by Franklin W. Otterstrom, assisted by Joseph 
Anderson, in the Assembly Hall, by Frederick E. Barker, and Fred 
G. Barker. 

Edward H. Anderson, Clerk of the Conference.

Prophecies of Joseph Smith and Their Fulfillment 

« BY NEPHI LOWELL MORRIS 

Was Joseph Smith a Prophet? What answers come from the 
century that has rolled by since he beheld his first vision? Have 
the Latter-day Saints misplaced faith in him? After the progress 
of a hundred years, what has Time done with his claims to the 
title of a Prophet? 

In order to make plain the outcome of Time the author has 
dug up old and forgotten manuscripts and prints which he lays 
before his readers, with photographic reproductions of the orig- 
inals. Price, $1.25.

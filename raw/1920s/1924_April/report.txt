dent of the Utah stake of Zion. 

The choir and congregation sang, "Guide us, O thou great 
Jehovah." 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

It certainly is a very inspiring sight to see this house full and 
people standing at this our first session of the conference. 

THE CHURCH IN EXCELLENT CONDITION 

I rejoice in the growth of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints at home and abroad. I rejoice in feeling that we have 
every cause to be grateful to the Lord for the blessings that have come 
to us during the past year. I believe that I am within the bounds of 
truth when I say that the Church was never in a better condition 
than at the present time, that there was never greater unity existing 
among the general authorities of the Church, more anxiety and de- 
termination to serve the Lord, than today; that we never had more 
energetic and faithful men presiding over the stakes of Zion and in 
the wards and missions of the Church than today; neither have we 
had more energetic, faithful men and women, than have been presid- 
ing and are presiding at the present time, as general, stake and 
ward officers in our various auxiliary organizations. 

GOOD WORK BY THE AUXILIARY ORGANIZATIONS 

It fell to my lot, yesterday afternoon, to address the conference 
of the Relief Society for a few minutes. The Assembly Hall was 
filled to overflowing, and many people were standing. I am con- 
vinced that such a gathering as that of active, wide-awake, energetic 
women-members could not be witnessed among any other people, 
who are no more numerous than are the Latter-day Saints, Our Relief 
Societies are doing a very remarkable and wonderful work in looking 
after the sick and the afflicted. I remember one very good friend of 
mine, a non-member of the Church, said to his wife just before he 
passed away, so she told me, that no other people, in his estimation 
— and he had traveled nearly all over the world — took as good care 
of their sick and looked after their poor as well as do the Latter-day 
Saints. They are really one great family of brothers and sisters, 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT

united with a common bond of love and respect. Our young people, 
and those who look after the children of the Primary Association are 
also doing a splendid work. 

SATISFACTORY RFPORTS FROM THE MISSIONS 

The reports from our Missions from all over the world are very 
satisfactory ; and the one call, claim, or plea that is made is, "Send us 
more missionaries." There is only one real exception to this, and 
that is in Japan. There is no exception in the call for more mission- 
aries in that field, but, after twenty-odd years of labor in that coun- 
try, we are convinced that not a dozen people have been thoroughly 
converted to the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. We have seriously 
considered the question of closing that mission, but have not yet 
arrived at any conclusion. 

ENLIGHTENING STATISTICS 

It has been customary, at April conferences, to give some statistics 
to the people regarding the expenditure of their tithing. Nearly the 
entire tithing paid during the past year has been returned, in various 
appropriations, to the different stakes of Zion. 

General — The amount returned to the stakes from the tithes, for 
stake and ward purposes, during the past year and for main- 
tenance and operation of the same, has been (I shall not read 
the odd figures) $ 993,000 

The amount expended for the maintenance and operation of Church 

schools has been 835,000 

The amount expended for the construction, maintenance and opera- 
tion of temples has been 449,000 

Expended for hospital construction 146,000 

Since our last General Conference our hospital in Idaho Falls, cost- 
ing in the neighborhood of $400,000 has been dedicated, and is 
open for the care of the afflicted. 

For Charity — For the care of the worthy poor and other charitable 

purposes, including hospital treatment 171,000 

Missions — For the maintenance and operation of all the missions, 
and for the erection of places of worship and other buildings in 
the missions 586,000 

The grand total — Taken from the tithes, and returned by the 
Trustee-in-Trust to the Saints for the maintenance and opera- 
tion of the stakes and wards, for the maintenance and opera- 
tion of Church schools, temples, charities, and for mission ac- 
tivities is , $3,182,207.22 

Other Charities — In addition to charities paid out of the tithes, as 
before stated, there have also been distributed the fast offerings 
and Relief Society and other charities, amounting to $471,000 
which, added to the $171,000 paid from the tithes, makes a total 
of Church charities of $643,060.47. 

Following statistics and other reports are compiled from the 
Church records for the year 1923: 

Church growth — Children blessed and entered upon the records of 

the Church, in the stakes and missions 19,199 

Children baptized in the stakes and missions 13,020 

Converts baptized and entered on the records of the stakes and 

missions 7,492

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



The organized stakes of Zion now number 90. 
Wards and independent branches 972.

There are branches in the missions, 63,5. 
The birth-rate in the Church is 35 per 1000. 

The marriage-rate is 14 per 1000. I think that ought to be increased. 
The death-rate is 7.2, which is certainly very satisfactory indeed. 
There are 157,990 persons in the Church who are married. 
There were 241 persons divorced in the year 1923.

TEXT FOE AN IMPORTANT SUBJECT 

I am requested to read this announcement. 

"Mendelssohn's oratorio entitled, Elijah, will be given this evening, 
Friday, in the Tabernacle, commencing at 8:15. In addition to the choir 
of two hundred and fifty voices selected from the Tabernacle Choir, ten 
talented soloists, and an orchestra of forty men, will take part. The com- 
mittee announce popular prices of 25c and .50c. Tickets may be obtained 
at the box office and at the Bureau of Information. The choir and mu- 
sicians have been preparing this splendid oratorio for many months, and 
a musical treat is promised to all who attend. Will you kindly emphasize 
the above, and oblige, 

"Sincerely, The Committee." 

I have decided to emphasize it by devoting my talk, entirely, or 
practically so, to that subject. I had not made up my mind until this 
morning what I would talk about. 

On the 21st day of September, 1823, nearly seven years before 
the organization of the Church, Moroni, an angel, made the follow- 
ing statement to Joseph Smith the Prophet: 

"Behold, I will reveal unto you the Priesthood, by ihe hand of Elijah 
the prophet, before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord. 

"And he shall plant in the hearts of the children the promises made 
to the fathers, and the hearts of the children shall turn to their fathers. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT

"If it were not so, the whole earth would be utterly wasted at his 
coming." 

In the revelation known as the Preface to the Doctrine and Cove- 
nants we are told: 

"Search these commandments, for they are true and faithful, and the 
prophecies and promises which are in them shall all be fulfilled. 

"What I the Lord have spoken, I have spoken, and I excuse not myself; 
and though the heavens and the earth pass away, my word shall not pass 
away, but shall be fulfilled, whether by mine own voice or by the voice 
of my servants, it is the same. 

"For behold, and lo, the Lord is God, and the Spirit beareth record, 
and the record is true, and the truth abideth forever and ever. Amen." 

THE APPEARANCE OF ELIJAH 

In 1836, about thirteen years after the angel Moroni declared 
that Elijah should restore again the Priesthood, Elijah appeared to 
Oliver Cowdery and the Prophet Joseph Smith, in the Kirtland temple. 
The record of this appearance is to be found in the Doctrine and 
Covenants, Section 110. Not only did Elijah appear, upon that 
occasion, in the Kirtland temple, to the Prophet and to Oliver 
Cowdery, but the Savior and others appeared, and I will read not 
only regarding Elijah's appearance, but also that of the Savior. The 
Savior stated: 

"I am the first and the last; I am he who liveth, I am he who was 
slain; I am your advocate with the Father." 

OUR SAVIOR, THE LORD JESUS CHRIST LIVES 

I know of nothing for which we, as Latter-day Saints, should 
be more grateful than the absolute knowledge that every Latter-day 
Saints has, that Jesus is the Christ, the Savior of the world, the Son 
of the living God. All over the world today, even among professed 
Christians, there is a lack of faith in the divinity of the Savior. Even 
some ministers of the gospel go far enough to declare from their pulpits 
that they do not believe that Jesus was the Son of God. There is 
no doubt in the mind of any Latter-day Saint living regarding the 
fact that Jesus is the Son of God, because when the boy Joseph Smith, 
not yet fifteen years of age, went into the woods to pray in the Sacred 
Grove, he saw God the Father and God introduced to him his well- 
beloved Son, and told this boy to hear Him. Every Latter-day Saint 
believes absolutely in the revelations contained in the Doctrine and 
Covenants, that they are true ; and in one of these revelations we have 
this recorded by Sidney Rigdon and the Prophet: 

"And now, after the many testimonies which have been given of him, 
this is the testimony last of all, which we give of him : That he lives ! 

"For we saw him, even on the right hand of God; and we heard the 
voice bearing record that he is the Only Begotten of the Father — 

"That by him, and through him, and of him, the worlds are and 
were created, and the inhabitants thereof are begotten sons and daughters 
unto God."

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



We have an account of the actual appearance of the Savior in the 
first temple erected in this dispensation which was at Kirtland. 

"I am the first and the last; I am he who liveth, I am he who was 
slain; I am your advocate with the Father. 

"Behold, your sins are forgiven you; you are clean before me; there- 
fore, lift up your heads and rejoice. 

"Let the hearts of your brethren rejoice, and let the hearts of all my 
people rejoice, who have, with their might, built this house to my name. 

"For behold, I have accepted this house, and my name shall be here; 
and I will manifest myself to my people in mercy in this house." 

Then after the appearance of the Savior we have the following: 

KEYS TO GATHERING OF ISRAEL RESTORED 

"After this vision closed, the heavens were again opened unto us; and 
Moses appeared before us, and committed unto us the keys of the gathering 
of Israel from the four parts of the earth, and the leading of the ten tribes 
from the land of the north." 

One of the Articles of Faith of the Latter-day Saints is : 

"We believe in the literal gathering of Israel and in the restoration of 
the Ten Tribes; that Zion shall be built upon this [the American] con- 
tinent; that Christ will reign personally upon the earth; and that the 
earth will be renewed and receive its paradisiacal glory." 

"After this, Elias appeared, and committed the dispensation of the 
gospel of Abraham, saying that in us and our seed all generations after us 
should be blessed. 

VISITATION OF ELIJAH IN FULFILMENT OF MALACHl's PREDICTION 

"After this vision had closed, another great and glorious vision burst 
upon us; for Elijah the prophet, who was taken to heaven without tasting 
death, stood before us, and said: 

"Behold the time has fully come, which was spoken of by the mouth 
of Malachi — testifying that he [Elijah] should be sent, before the great 
and dreadful day of the Lord come — 

"To turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the children 
to the fathers, lest the whole earth be smitten with a curse — 

"Therefore, the keys of this dispensation are committed into your 
hands and by this ye may know that the great and dreadful day of the 
Lord is near, even at the doors." 

This visitation of Elijah to the Kirtland temple was on April 3, 
1836, the 88th anniversary being yesterday. 

THE FAITH OF THE SAINTS VERIFIED BY TEMPLES AND WORKS THEREIN 

I rejoice in the fact that the Latter-day Saints believe absolutely 
beyond the peradventure of a doubt, that Elijah did come, that he did 
commit the keys to Oliver Cowdery and to Joseph Smith, and the 
temple erected in Kirtland, the temple erected in Nauvoo, and the 
temples that have been erected here in thjs state of Utah, and those in 
Hawaii and in Canada, and the one that is now being erected in Mesa 
City, Arizona, bear testimony, to the extent of millions of dollars of 
money, of the faith of the Latter-day Saints that the keys have been

given, whereby we can, in very deed, be saviors upon Mount Zion for 
those who have died without a knowledge of the gospel. 

AN AWAKENING ON THIS SUBJECT IN ALL THE WORLD 

And simultaneously, almost, with the declaration way back in 
1823 by the Angel Moroni, (Section 2, Doctrine and Covenants 
that I have read to you,) all over the world there came into the hearts 
of people, not of our faith, a desire to organize genealogical societies, 
to compile records of names by the thousands, and tens of thousands. 
I have met in many lands and in many climes, men who have spent 
years, and a large amount of treasure, and almost their entire time, 
in compiling rcords of their ancestors. I have asked them why they 
did it. They said they did not know, they were seized with a great 
desire to compile records of their ancestors ; and, as we know, these 
records are worth their weight in gold to the Latter-day Saints. 

INTEREST IN WORK FOR THE DEAD INCREASING 

It fell to my lot last night to make a brief address to the repre- 
sentatives of the Genealogical scoieties and organizations of the 
Church, on the top floor of the Bishop's Building. The auditorium 
there was crowded to overflowing. We have had a great many 
gatherings there at one time and another, but I have never attended a 
(gathering in that building when the room was as well filled as it was 
last night. It was a meeting of enthusiastic laborers, whose works 
testify to the coming of Elijah, to the turning of the hearts of the 
fathers to the children, and of the children to the fathers. This work 
is being carried on, and as I have read to you in the statistics here this 
morning, over five-hundred thousand more ordinances were per- 
formed in our temples this past year than were performed during a 
like period five years ago. I rejoice in the splendid work that is being 
accomplished, and in the wonderful loyalty of those who are work- 
ing in the temples, and those who are gathering information for gen- 
ealogical work of different kinds. 

I believe that the Committee will be reasonably well satisfied 
with my emphasis of the great oratorio here tonight, of Elijah. I 
hope the house will be crowded to overflowing. 

WE ARE ENGAGED IN THE MARVELOUS WORK OF THE LORD 

I rejoice in the blessings of the Lord, I rejoice in a knowledge 
that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, the Savior of the world, and 
that Joseph Smith was a prophet of the true and the living God. We 
are engaged in the work of the Lord, and I wish to read the words of 
the Lord given to the grandfather of our late beloved President Joseph 
F. Smith, the father of the Prophet Joseph and the Patriarch Hyrurn 
Smith. These words were given, remember, before the Church was 
organized : 

"Now behold, a marvelous work is about to come forth among the 
children of men.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



"Therefore, O ye that embark in the service of God, see that ye serve 
him with all your heart, might, mind and strength, that ye may stand 
blameless before God at the last day. 

"Therefore, if ye have desire to serve God, ye are called to the work; 

"For behold the field is white already to harvest; and lo, he that 
thrusteth in his sickle with his might, the same layeth up in store that he 
perisheth not, but bringeth salvation to his soul; 

"And faith, hope, charity and love, with an eye single to the glory of 
God, qualify him for the work. 

"Remember faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, brotherly 
kindness, godliness, charity, humility, diligence. 

"Ask, and ye shall receive; knock, and it shall be opened unto you. 
Amen. 

THE GREAT PURPOSE OF OUR LABORS DECLARED 

And before the Church was organized a revelation was given 
to the father of our beloved President Joseph F. Smith. I will not 
read it all, but it is Section II, given in May, 1829, nearly a year 
before the organizing of the Church. Hyrum Smith desired that his 
brother, the Prophet, should inquire of the Lord as to what labor he 
should perform. He said: 

"Now, as you have asked, behold, I say unto you, keep my 
commandments," I desire with all the power that God has given me 
to emphasize that. That applies to every man, woman and child in 
all the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. "Keep my com- 
mandments, and seek to bring forth and establish the cause of Zion. 

"Seek not for riches but for wisdom; and, behold, the mysteries of 
God shall be unfolded unto you, and then shall you be made rich. Behold, 
he that hath eternal life is rich. 

"Verily, verily, I say unto you, even as you desire of me so it shall 
be done unto you; and, if you desire, you shall be the means of doing much 
good in this generation. 

"Say nothing but repentance unto this generation." 

Remember that, O all ye people : Say nothing but repentance. 
Teach and live the first principles of the gospel, and let the mysteries 
of heaven wait until you get to heaven. 

"Keep my commandments, and assist to bring forth my work, accord- 
ing to my commandments, and you shall be blessed. 

"Behold, thou hast a gift or thou shalt have a gift if thou wilt desire 
of me in faith, with an honest heart, believing in the power of Jesus Christ 
or in my power which speaketh unto thee: - 

"For, behold, it is I that speak; behold, I am the light which shineth 
in darkness, and by my power I give these words unto thee. 

"And now, verily, verily, I say unto thee, put your trust in that 
Spirit which leadeth to do good — yea, to do justly, to walk humbly, to judge 
righteously; and this is my Spirit * * * 

"Build upon my rock, which is my gospel; 

"Deny not the spirit of revelation, nor the spirit of prophecy, for 
wo unto him that denieth these things; 

"Therefore, treasure up in your heart until the time which is in my 
wisdom that you shall go forth. 

"Behold, I speak unto all who have good desires, and have thrust in 
their sickle to reap. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT

"Behold, I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God. I am the life and the 
light of the world. 

"I am the same, who came unto mine own and mine own received m<e 

not; 

"But verily, verily, I say omto you, that as many as receive me, to 
them will I give power to become the sons of God, even to them that 
believe on my name. Amen. 

Please remember, Latter-day Saints, that this revelation declares 
that the Lord speaks unto all of us who have a desire to labor — to 
seek not for riches, but to bring forth the work of God, and to labor 
for the accomplishment of that purpose. 

THE RESPONSIBILITY OF PARENTS 

Now I see the time that I desired to occupy has expired, but I 
want to speak just a little more and read a few words that I have been 
studying occasionally, now for forty long years, since it fell to my lot 
to be one of the apostles : 

"And again, inasmuch as parents have children in Zion, or in any of 
her stakes which are organized, that teach them not to understand the doc- 
trine of repentance, faith in Christ the Son of the Living God, and of bap- 
tism and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of the hands, when 
eight years old, the sin be upon the heads of the parents. 

"For this shall be a law" — not an exhortation remember, but a law — 
"unto the inhabitants of Zion, or in any of her stakes which are organized. 

"And their children shall be baptized for the remission of their sins 
when eight years old, and receive the laying on of the hands. 

"And they shall also teach their children to pray, and to walk uprightly 
before the Lord." 

THE SACRED DUTY OF COMMUNION WITH GOD THROUGH PRAYER 

And the way to* teach our children to pray is to pray ourselves 
in secret and in our families. There is too much neglect in having 
communion with God on the part of many of the Latter-day Saints. 
I feel a joy and a happiness every day of my life in communicating 
with my Maker, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, my Redeemer. 
And those who do not have a radio communication, so to speak, with 
our Heavenly Father and our Redeemer, are losing the inspiration that 
comes from the Lord. 

"And the inhabitants of Zion shall also observe the Sabbath day to 
keep it holy. 

"And the inhabitants of Zion also shall remember their labors, inas- 
much as they are appointed to labor, in all faithfulness; for the idler shall 
be had in remembrance before the Lord. 

"Now, I, the Lord, am not well pleased with the inhabitants of Zion, 
for there are idlers among them; and their children are also growing up in 
wickedness; they also seek not earnestly the riches of eternity, but their eyes 
are full of greediness. 

"These things ought not to be, and must be done away from among 
them; wherefore, let my servant Oliver Cowdery carry these sayings unto 
the land of Zion. 

"And a commandment I give unto them — that he that observeth not 
his prayers before the Lord in the season thereof, let him be had in remem- 
brance before the judge of my people. 



10 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



"These sayings are true and faithful; wherefore, transgress them not, 
neither take therefrom. 

"Behold, I am Alpha and Omega, and I ccme quickly. Amen." 

TAKE TO HEART THE DUTY OF TEACHING FAITH IN JESUS CHRIST 

I pray that the parents who are within the sound of my voice, 
and those who may read in the conference reports, or in our papers, 
what I say, may take to heart the duty that devolves upon them under 
a commandment from the Lord Almighty to teach faith in the Lord 
Jesus Christ, to their children, that they shall pray and walk uprightly. 
That the Lord may help us to rear our beloved children in the nurture 
and admonition of the gospel, and in a love of God and of our Re- 
deemer, and that each and every soul who has a testimony of the 
divinity of this work may live the gospel in uprightness, in virtue, 
and in truth, that their lives may preach the truth to those with 
whom they come in contact, is my prayer, and I ask it in the name 
of Jesus Chirst, Amen. 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE 

This is not the first time in my life that I have heen taken by sur- 
prise. I felt quite content to sit on the stand here this morning and 
listen to the words of inspiration that have fallen from the lips of 
President Heber J. Grant, feeling that he would occupy most, if not 
all, of the time. I take great pleasure in bearing testimony to the 
truth of the things that he has uttered. Perhaps there is no need for 
that. I believe that that testimony is in the hearts of this vast con- 
gregation this morning. I enjoyed every word the President has ut- 
tered. I know that what he has said and read and testified of is true, 
and it came to us this morning in the life and power and spirit of 
the gospel of Jesus Christ as revealed to us in these last days. I enjoy 
meetings of this kind and teachings of this kind. They are more to my 
heart and soul than learned disquisitions of any kind. 

THE PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL TO THE NATIONS 

I rejoice in this gospel which the Lord has revealed for the sal- 
vation of the human family. I have labored in this Church for a good 
many years, and feel very thankful in my soul this morning that the 
Lord has preserved me to the extent that I have been able to labor up 
to the present time, notwithstanding the weaknesses and frailties of 
human nature, and the burdens, so to speak, of old age. God be praised 
for all his goodness to me, and to this people who are gathered here 
from many lands. What a great thing it is to look upon this con- 
gregation this morning and consider what God has already wrought ; 
then to lift up the curtain and look to that which is coming and see 
something of that which will be in the future. This congregation is 
representative of the Church which is now occupying many lands. 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE 11 



When the angel that John the Revelator saw in the vision was to come 
to the earth bearing the everlasting gospel, it was to be preached to 
"every nation and kindered and tongue and people," and they were to be 
called with a loud voice to "fear God and keep his commandments, for 
the hour of his judgment has come," and to "worship him that made 
heaven and earth and the sea, and the fountains of waters." That is 
a commandment to us. John heard the voice in the vision, and it has 
been echoed again in the last days, for the Lord revealed through 
the Prophet Joseph Smith that this was the work of his servants. That 
which the Lord revealed through the Prophet Joseph Smith stands to- 
day as the duty of this people, gathering from afar in fulfilment of 
what Isaiah and Micah, the prophets of old, saw in their visions. They 
saw that the people of this Church would come from all parts of the 
earth into the tops of the mountains, and that here should be "the 
mountain of the Lord's house," and the people would say: "Come, 
and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the 
God of Jacob. And he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk 
in his paths ; And the law shall go forth from Zion, and the word of 
the Lord from Jerusalem. And he shall judge among many nations, 
and they shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears in- 
to pruning hooks, and the time shall come when the sword shall not 
be lifted up any more ; but the people will serve the Lord and walk 
in his ways, and prepare for the coming of their King; even Jesus 
the Christ." 

THE COMING OF THE PRINCE OF PEACE 

What a blessing it is to be privileged to look upon this body of 
people this morning gathered in from the various nations of the earth 
who have come up here, not merely to better their temporal condition, 
but to learn the ways of God and walk in his paths, and to prepare the 
way for the coming of the great King, Jesus of Nazareth — once of 
humble birth, but who now will come in glory to the earth. This is our 
work, my brethren and sisters, to serve the Lord, to learn his ways, to 
walk in his paths, that the law may go forth from Zion, and that 
nations afar off may be so influenced that they will cast away their 
weapons of war, and turn them into weapons of peace, and prepare for 
the coming of the great King who is the Prince of Peace. 

WE ARE HERE TO SERVE THE LORD 

I have had the privilege and joy and duty, for several years, of 
laboring in this cause, at home and abroad, and for this great honor I 
do thank and praise the Lord this morning. When I think of how 
the Lord has blessed and sustained me at home and abroad, and lifted 
up the veil from my eyes, and given me to see the things of his King- 
dom, I praise him with all my heart. I rejoice in knowing that there 
are so many good men and women gathered from afar, and their chil- 
dren coming up after them, who are here for that great purpose ; not 
merely to gather riches, not merely to make the desert blossom like 



12 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



the rose, not merely to subdue the elements and bring them into sub- 
jection, but to serve the Lord, to learn what he wants done, and then 
to do it with all their might and mind and strength. This is what 
the Lord said he wanted the people to do when they gathered into 
Jackson county, in Missouri, to endeavor to prepare the way for the 
coming of the great King and to fulfil the predictions of the Prophets 
and perform the great work of redemption for the living and the 
dead, which God had marked out for this great dispensation. "Thou 
shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy might, 
and with all thy strength, and in the name of Jesus Christ, thou shalt 
serve him." That was the first great commandment to the people 
gathered, to the spot designed for Zion. The Lord made some 
great predictions there to the people, and that were contingent upon 
their doing this. The President has read some things that the Lord 
revealed at that time, which the people were to do. Go up unto the 
house of prayer on this my holy day. That was one of the things that 
we were to do. The rest of the commandments there and the bless- 
ings that he said should come upon the people were predicated upon 
their doing these things; and here is a truth that should be always 
present and clear to the minds of the Latter-day Saints: that the 
blessings which are promised them, whether it be in holy ordinances 
or in the words of the servants of God, or in the revelations direct 
from the Most High, they are all predicated upon this great thing; 
that we shall do the things which are commanded. 

BLESSINGS PREDICATED UPON SERVING THE LORD 

Every blessing that is pronounced upon us, whether in the tem- 
ples of the Lord or elsewhere, is predicated upon our obedience to the 
commandments. Even in the Word of Wisdom, we are told there that 
we shall receive certain blessings if we observe certain rules, if we 
abstain from certain things that are not good for us. And then it 
says: And they shall receive these promises, if they also "keep the 
commandments." These are to be learned and obeyed, and it is our 
duty to teach them to our children as we have heard this morning. 
Now, do not forget this: A great many promises have been made 
concerning things to be done in Zion, but unless we keep the com- 
mandments of God and perform the duties God has placed upon our 
shoulders, we cannot claim the blessings. The Lord says he promises, 
and people do not obey, and then he revokes, and they receive not the 
blessings. What? Is it possible that God revokes? Yes; he says so. 
Commandments are given and revoked — what for ? Because the people 
who were to observe the commandments do not observe them, and are 
not worthy or prepared to receive the blessings. 

In the 34th section of the Doctrine and Covenants we read of some 
things the Lord commanded to the people at that time, in that place. 
They have not yet come to pass. He has stated there, these things 
shall be done in that "generation." 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE 13 



THE LENGTH OF A GENERATION 

Speaking of the word generation, I may make a remark or two 
that perhaps, will be timely because of some notions some of our 
brethren entertain in regard to this point. What do you mean when 
you speak of a generation? Do you mean some particular period of 
time? Not generally, the word does not mean that. You do not find 
it to mean that, if you search the dictionary. What do you mean by 
generation? Well, you take the Bible and you can begin by reading: 
These are the generations of Adam ; these are the generations of Seth ; 
and these are the generations of Noah after the flood. Does that 
refer to some particular period of time — one hundred years, as some 
of our brethren interpret it? No, it means the posterity, the genera- 
tions, the families, the children that were to come. The generations 
of Adam, some of them, lived hundreds of years, not merely one hun- 
dred years. 

I remember that in the old Doctrine and Covenants, the edition 
with which I was most familiar, Elder Orson Pratt, of the council of 
the Twelve Apostles, who separated the book into verses, and made a 
great many footnotes, had one footnote which said most positively 
that a generation did not expire in one hundred years. Well, a notion 
has got into the heads of some of our brethren that it does mean just 
one hundred years, because, in the Book of Mormon we read of cer- 
tain events that were to occur within four hundred years, and then, 
in another place, that they were to be in the fourth generation. Well, 
Brother Pratt said, it does not expire in a hundred years, and he had 
studied the matter from a philological standpoint. Now what I am 
referring to is this: a few of our brethren, some of them men of im- 
portance, declare that one hundred years from the date of that revel- 
ation, which is in the 84th Section of the Doctrine and Covenants, all 
those things that are there spoken of must be fulfilled. Well now, 
the Lord in that revelation sometimes says a thing shall be, when he 
is giving it by way of commandment. Sometimes the word is used in 
the way of a prediction, but in this very matter that I am referring to, 
we read in the 124th Section of the Doctrine and Covenants that God 
gave it by way of commandment — "I gave a commandment to my peo- 
ple that they should build a house unto me," building it in that gen- 
eration in a certain place, pointed out by the finger of God to the Prophet 
Joseph who dedicated it. Now in the 124th Section the Lord declares 
that that was a commandment, the people were to build the house at 
that place in that generation. If you will read carefully the revelations 
I speak of now, you will find that the Lord refers particularly to this 
very requirement in regard to Jackson county, Missouri, and he de- 
clares that the people there were commanded to build a house to him 
at that time, and on that spot. But their enemies came upon them and 
prevented them from doing that which the Lord commanded them, and 
therefore the Lord accepted their offering. The Lord lays down there 
a principle which it is well for us to understand. The Lord says that 



14 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



whenever he gives a commandment, no matter what it is about, 
to the children of men, and they go to with their might 
and endeavor to fulfil his commandment, and do that which 
is required of them, and they are prevented by their enemies, or 
by any other means, from accomplishing it, he does not require it any 
more at their hands. He accepts of their offering. That has applied 
in the past, and will apply in the future, and we should remember it. 
If God gives a commandment, and we do not obey it, why he revokes 
it, and he revokes the blessings. If he gives us a commandment to do 
certain things, and we find ourselves unable to do them, either by re- 
stricted laws or any other obstacles in the way of physical force, the 
Lord requires them no more but accepts our offering, and he will visit 
his wrath and indignation upon those who prevent his people from 
accomplishing that which he required at their hands. 

NO DATE SET FOR THE COMING OF THE LORD 

Now that is worth understanding, so that the idea that is prevail- 
ing, or that some have endeavored to establish, that in about six or 
seven years what they call the "winding up scene" will take place; 
that everything will take place to finish up the work in that time. That 
is a mistake ; that is all there is to it. And so we need not be deceived 
at any time by the notions and opinions of men in regard to times and 
dates of things that are to occur. 

There are a quite a number of people, who set the date to the time 
of the coming of the Savior. Only recently I have heard of such testi- 
monies being borne in some of our fast meetings. That is all wrong; 
that should not be done. The Lord has not, at any time, so far as I 
am aware, in all my searchings in the revelations that have come to the 
earth, set a date for the coming of the Savior to reign on the earth. 
He said when he was upon the earth that he did not know, and even 
the angels of heaven did not know. When Joseph the Prophet tried to 
find out the Lord did not answer his question directly, but told him if 
he lived to a certain time he should behold the face of his Redeemer. 
So my brethren and sisters, do not be deceived by any means in re- 
gard to this setting of dates for the fulfilment of certain predictions. 
The Apostle Paul had to say to the Saints in his day that they were 
not to be deceived by any means as to the day of the coming of the 
Son of man, "for," said he, "let no man deceive you by word or by 
speech or by letter as from us; as that the day of Christ is at hand. 
Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, 
except there come a falling away first." 

Do you see that the people were led away then, as sometimes now, 
by these ideas and notions that prevailed for a while? 

LET US PERFORM OUR DUTY AND THE BLESSINGS ARE SURE 

Now what we need to do, my brethren and sisters, is to do the 
work that we are gathered here for. God has brought us from many 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE 15 



lands. There are people in this congregation that I have known in 
foreign countries, where I have labored, and I rejoice that they are 
here. I rejoice with all my heart. I rejoice that God is doing this 
grand work of gathering his Israel from the nations of the earth, 
■bringing them to Zion and clothing them with the power of his Holy 
Priesthood. It is with us today, that power and influence and spirit 
of this gospel. It is with our President. It does my heart good to 
hear the sound of his voice, knowing that it penetrates throughout this 
congregation, and that it finds an echo in the souls of the Latter-day 
Saints. I am glad that my brethren laboring in the various missions 
can come here and hear the sound of his voice and feel the ardor and 
strength of his presence and carry it away with them to their respective 
fields of labor. And so with the presidents of stakes, the bishops of 
wards ; it is a splendid thing to come here and have our souls refreshed 
in this way. The Lord's spirit is here, and his power is here, and the 
authority and keys of the Holy Priesthood, revealed in former times to 
Peter James and John, and brought to the earth in latter days to the 
Prophet Joseph and to Oliver Cowdery; those keys are with us today 
and that is the point that we should understand ; that today, if ye will 
hear his voice, harden not your hearts, receive the word today, find 
out the duties of today through the living oracles, perform these duties, 
the blessings are sure to come. "Search these things," the Lord said, 
as the President read them. They are true and faithful and they will 
be fulfilled. I know that they have been fulfilled hitherto in my own 
experience. God has been with me wherever I have been sent to labor 
in his cause, and wherever I have done my duty, and I have tried to 
do it, for a good many years, with all my might and soul and strength, 
his power has been upon me, the light of the Lord has shone upon my 
understanding, and I have seen the things of the kingdom afar off. 

A REMINISCENCE AND A TESTIMONY 

Years and years ago, laboring and traveling without purse or scrip, 
in poverty so to speak, in weariness and labor, without a place to lay 
my head — that I very seldom refer to, because they were times of very 
great trial — in those days the Lord was with me, and the song of Zion 
was in my heart ; his strength, his salvation, was my daily portion. I 
have had pointed out to me, during the last few weeks, an article that 
I wrote for the Millennial Star about sixty-five years ago. It was 
published in the Millennial Star on Sept. 10, 1859, and in that I was 
able to portray, as I saw, the things that were coming upon this gen- 
eration, this wicked and perverse generation of people, and I have 
looked up the Star and read the article, and it has done me good to be 
able to see the fulfilment of the things that God made plain to my soul 
those many years ago ; that when I was laboring in the mission field at 
different periods his spirit and his power have been upon me, and the 
testimony of Zion has been in my heart, and I rejoice and praise the 
Lord this morning that I am still able to bear testimony that God, the 



16 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



great Creator, is our Father, the Father of our spirits, and that he has 
sent us on the earth at the right time, in the right place; and upon 
many of us he has given authority and the Holy Priesthood to minister 
for him. I know that is true, I know that Jesus of Nazareth is the 
Christ, the Son of the living God, the Son of the Eternal Father. He 
himself has declared that he was the First-born. How long ago that 
took place I do not know. I do not think anybody does know. We 
haven't heard the story, fully, of the early existence, the pre-existence 
of our Savior, nor of our own. We imagine a great many things con- 
cerning what we were and what we agreed to do and what we prom- 
ised, but they only amount to our thoughts and ideas. One certain 
thing is this : that we are here, born on the earth in the latter days for 
the purposes of God ; and he has led our footsteps here to these moun- 
tain valleys, and he has made our feet fast around about these hills, 
and the things that he has promised us will all be fulfilled if we will 
do our duty, if we will learn his word today and keep his command- 
ments now, and teach them to our children, our generations will 
rise up and call us blessed. 

HANG ON AND KEEP FAST HOLD OF THE TRUTH 

I am glad to meet with you, my brethren and sisters, today in this 
great congregation, and I am proud to know that you were my brothers 
and sisters in the spirit world, and in the gospel kingdom on the earth 
in the latter days, and that we are bound together by sacred covenants 
which we should observe always and remember what we are. I meet 
with a good many of our young boys and girls when they come back 
from serving as missionaries. I am always glad to meet them, and I 
advise them to hang on, and keep fast hold of the truth, and advise 
them to be sure and work today, not to leave what they have done in 
the past and then go astray, but to continue in the way of righteous- 
ness and always be ministers, missionaries, at home and abroad; for 
they are called by the Almighty to help in this great Latter-day work 
which will go on to a glorious consummation. 

GOD BE WITH YOU 

I thank God for this privilege of bearing this humble testimony 
today, and praise him with all my soul for all his goodness and kind- 
ness and protecting care to me, and for all his providences and mani- 
festations of his power to me. I praise him with all my heart, and in 
the midst of the congregation I say: Blessed be his name, forever. 
It always will be, no matter what I say or do, and his blessings will be 
ours, and upon you, my brethren, laboring in the ministry at home, 
or sent to minister abroad. God will be with you, and therein will be 
your strength. It will not be in worldly learning nor worldly riches, it 
will be in the revelations of the Holy Ghost to your souls, the power 
of your ministry, in the spirit of it. And in that you shall have joy 
in that you shall have success, and God will open up your way and 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE 17 



the increases that we have heard about this morning will continue and 
go on and be augmented. 

THIS WORK ONWARD AND UPWARD FOREVER 

This work is onward and upward, and it will be forever and ever. 
It will not be taken away from the earth again, it is here to stay. It will 
abide. It will prevail. It will overcome all its foes, all its obstacles, 
all its difficulties, and the Lord will inspire his servants, as he raises 
them up for the peculiar and special work in which they are to be 
engaged, and he will give them success therein as he has done with 
our brethren who have passed away, and our brother who has spoken 
to us this morning. He is our President and leader and the man hold- 
ing the keys of the sealing ordinances in the last days, and he is our 
President in very deed. He stands at the head, and if God has any- 
thing to reveal to the Church, as a Church, it will be revealed to him 
as long as he remains on the earth. God be with him. I sustain him 
with all my heart and soul as the President and leader of the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. We are witnesses to the truth 
of. all that he has said to us this morning, and to the divine Spirit 
which has rested upon him. 

Now may God's Spirit abide with you, my brethren holding the 
Priesthood, that you may be able to perform your duties successfully, 
that you may go forth from this conference, renewed and refreshed 
and invigorated, to stir up the people to righteousness, to encourage 
them to be faithful and true and to perform the work for which they 
have come on the earth. God bless you with all the blessings that your 
hearts can righteously desire, through Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JOHN WELLS 

(Of the Presiding Bishopric) 

It is a great privilege to meet, on occasions like this to hear the 
word of the Lord from his servants, and to be inspired with new 
resolves and desires. It gives us all an apportunity to examine ourselves, 
and to measure our standing in the Church, to see whether we are reach- 
ing the ideals the Lord designed us to reach. It enables us to go 
home with renewed determination to keep his commandments and to 
honor his name. I am satisfied this is the wish and desire of all who 
are here to-day. 

I thank the Lord with all my heart for the gospel, for the 
testimonies he has given me, for the privilege of gathering among 
his people and laboring in his ministry. I desire to serve the Lord, 
keep his commandments and honor his presiding brethren, and abide 
by their counsel and advice. 

The Lord has called us to labor in his ministry for the establish- 
ment of his mighty purposes on the earth, to build up his Church; 



18 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



and everything we do that will help to bring this about will redound 
to our blessing and comfort and give us joy in our ministry. 

Reference has been made by Presidents Grant and Penrose to 
the duty of the Latter-day Saints, of keeping the commandments of 
the Lord, and they have urged us to do so. Several important com- 
mandments have been mentioned, and I may be pardoned if I once 
more mention another, which comes to my attention in my labors as 
a counselor to Bishop Nibley, and that is a better and more prompt 
observance of the law of tithing. 

Great blessings will come to a man or woman who will observe this 
law. It will increase their faith in the gospel, their desire to serve 
the Lord, and they will be setting a good example. We should 
teach this law to our young people and see that they have an op- 
portunity to pay tithing. If our children are given funds or acquire 
means, they should be taught and encouraged to tithe it, so that the 
habit of tithe-paying will grow with them. There is a statement 
made by King Solomon, in the book of Proverbs, "Train up a child 
in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart 
from it." This can be applied to the observance of the law ojr 
tithing. 

Let us not rest up with the idea that because father has already 
paid a tithe, the child need not pay tithing. The child, if allowed to pay 
its tithing, even though it be small, will develop a good habit, and 
it will stay with him. This is another duty of fathers and mothers, 
to teach their children the observance of this law. 

Then, at tithing settlement, father should see that his boys and 
girls go with him, particularly the boys who hold the Priesthood. 
He should not go to settlement with the idea of asking the bishop 
to credit so much to one child and so much to another, but take 
the children with him, and let them pay the bishop themselves, and 
receive the receipt of the bishop. 

I am glad to say that there are more tithe-payers to-day, in 
the Church, than have ever been reported previously. There were 
special efforts made a few years ago to encourage payment of tith- 
ing by all members of the Church. This matter was not particularly 
stressed, in 1923, but because of the faithfulness and devotion of the 
leading brethren in the stakes and wards and the teaching of this 
law to the people, the number of tithe-payers has increased. How- 
ever, many have not paid tithing, as the records of the Church show, 
and therefore they are not receiving the blessings that the Lord has 
promised to those who will observe this law. He is willing and 
anxious to bless his people whenever they will obey the law upon 
which that blessing is predicated. 

The old habit of paying tithing once a year, at a special settlement 
with the bishopric of the ward, is slowly going out of use. There 
is growing in the Church a disposition on the part of the Saints to 
pay tithing monthly, or at other regular intervals. By this means 



ELDER JOHN WELLS 



19 



the payment of tithing is more faithfully observed, and it brings 
joy and satisfaction to those who tithe their income before they 
use the balance. If this practice is followed by the officers of the 
Church in the stakes and wards, it will grow among the Saints 
themselves and, in my opinion, is the best and proper method of 
paying tithing. Tithing settlement will be easier and less burdensome 
to the tithe-payer when all he pays at the end of the year will be 
his tithing for the month of December only. 

I thank the Lord for the inspiration of his servants, for their 
advice and counsel, for their splendid example ; and, no doubt, we shall 
all go home determined that in our homes, in the wards and in the 
stakes and missions where we may be laboring, we shall carry the 
instructions of President Grant, and use all our influence to see 
they are put into practice. This is my prayer, in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 

(President of the Southern States Mission) 

Brethren and sisters, I cannot help but feel impressed with the 
sense of my insignificance, as I stand in the presence of our Church 
leaders and of Israel, assembled in conference; but I do rejoice with 
all my heart in this wonderful gospel. As I listened to President Heber 
J. Grant and to President Charles W. Penrose, I said in my heart: 
"I will go with these men because God is with them," and the words of 
the Apostle Paul came to me. He said : "For if the trumpet give an 
uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?" 

Is there any uncertainty in the testimonies and the messages that 
have been delivered to Israel this morning? No. Doubt is swallowed 
up in knowledge and certainty. In the world there is doubt, there is 
uncertainty. One class of so-called religionists is teaching that Jesus is 
not divine, that he was not born of the Virgin Mary, and that the 
story of his bodily resurrection is a myth. We, the Latter-day Saints, 
standing on the sure foundation of revelation, and inspired by the testi- 
mony of the Holy Ghost, declare to all the world that Jesus is the 
Christ, the Son of God, the Redeemer of mankind, and in this testi- 
mony we are safe, and we shall win eternal life by obeying the com- 
mandments of our blessed Lord. Never in the history of the world, 
when God has sent forth his prophets, has there been uncertainty in 
their message. 

Unto Adam God declared : "If thou wilt turn unto me, and 
hearken unto my voice, and believe, and repent of all thy transgressions, 
and be baptized, even in water, in the name of mine Only Begotten 
Son, who is full of grace and truth, which is Jesus Christ, the only 
name which shall be given under heaven, whereby salvation shall come 
unto the children of men, ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. 



20 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



* * * For by the water ye keep the commandment, by the Spirit 
ye are justified, and by the blood ye are sanctified." And thus may 
all become the sons of God, for this is the plan of salvation unto all 
men. 

In this dispensation, the Lord hath thundered forth the command- 
ment in which these words occur: "Behold, the world is ripening 
in iniquity; and it must needs be that the children of men are stirred 
up unto repentance, both the Gentiles and also the house of Israel." 
The gospel trumpet is sounding clearly and with certainty. The Apos- 
tle Paul said that God commandeth all men everywhere to repent. 
Remission of sins follows sincere repentance, the baptism of water 
and the gift of the Holy Ghost. 

Brethren and sisters, your sons and your daughters in the world 
are proclaiming the message of life and salvation, and they are pro- 
claiming it in the spirit of the Christ. Recently two elders in the 
Southern States mission, while delivering their message, were taken 
from the home in which they were preaching, by a mob of about forty 
men. Into the woods they were taken, and the mob declared that they 
had brought them there to punish them. One of the elders said to those 
hard-hearted and cruel men: "My companion is not well. He is sick. 
The punishment you are going to give him, give to me. I am willing 
to bear what you are going to do to him. These noble words and 
Christ-like spirit softened the fury of the mob to some extent. The 
elder bore part of his companion's burden. Woe, woe, to those men 
who persecute the servants of God. They are under the displeasure 
of him who said : "Vengeance is mine, and I will repay." 

I bear my testimony that Joseph Smith is a Prophet of God, that 
through him the Almighty delivered a message to the world which is 
soul-saving, and which will exalt people to be sons and daughters of 
God. Brethren and sisters, in all earnestness and in all humility, I 
thank my heavenly Father that the leaders of this Church are not pro- 
claiming mysteries to the people, but they are declaring the saving 
principles of the gospel; and inspired by their teachings we mission- 
aries look at them and say : "There stand the First Presidency ; there 
we stand, too." 

God said to the Prophet Joseph Smith: "And thy people shall 
never be turned against thee by the testimony of traitors." This is a 
continuing promise. The people of God will never, so long as they 
listen to the counsels of their leaders, be turned from those men who 
have been divinely appointed to counsel Israel, to be shepherds of the 
people, and to point the way to eternal life. 

"He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat ; 
He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment seat; 
O be swift, my soul, to answer Him! be jubilant, my feet! 
Our God is marching on." 

I bear testimony that the gospel is the power of God unto salva- 
tion, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 

(Of the Presiding Bishopric of the Church) 

I am grateful for section eleven of the Doctrine and Covenants, 
referred to by President Grant. While this was given to Hyrum Smith, 
through his brother Joseph, for his personal guidance, the revelation, 
like all others in the Doctrine and Covenants, contains much in- 
formation which is of great value to all of us. I was first attracted 
to this revelation because it was given to my grandfather, in answer 
to his prayer for further light and guidance. I enjoy reading it, and 
have received much encouragement from so doing; and, as I read 
it again and again, I get from it new thoughts and new encouragement. 
At the time this revelation was given, Joseph Smith was translating 
the Book of Mormon, his brother Hyrum lending every aid as 
he followed this work, believing it to be a sacred record. His 
soul was filled with a desire to spread the new light and knowledge 
amon his fellowmen; he, therefroe, asked his brother to inquire of 
the Lord that he might know the will of the Lord concerning this work, 
at it pertained to him. Hyrum was not yet prepared for the great 
change that was to take place in religious thought and doctrines. The 
Lord in his mercy found it necessary to restrain him until .he had 
been prepared. 

It was the common belief that any man desiring to preach could 
take it upon himself to do so without being especially called and 
ordained by one having authority. The Lord's answer to this prayer 
was : 

Behold, I command you that you need not suppose that you are called 
to preach until you are called. 

Wait a little longer, until you shall have my word, my rock, my Church, 
and my gospel, that you may know of a surety my doctrine. 

And then, behold, according to your desires, yea, even according to your 
faith shall it be done unto you. 

Keep my commandments; hold your peace; appeal unto my Spirit; 

Yea, cleave unto me with all your heart, that you may assist in bringing 
to light those things of which has been spoken — yea, the translation of my 
work; be patient until you shall accomplish it. 

Behold, this is your work, to keep my commandments, yea, with all 
your might, mind and strength. 

Seek not to declare my word, but first seek to obtain my word, and 
then shall your tongue be loosed; then, if you desire, you shall have my 
Spirit and my word, yea, the power of God unto the convincing of men. 

But now hold your peace; study my word which hath gone forth among 
the children of men, and also study my word which shall come forth among 
the children of men, or that which is now translating, yea, until you have 
obtained it, which I shall grant unto the children of men in this generation, 
and then shall al things be added thereto. 

There was to be a new Church, or, rather, the old one restored. 
The word of the Lord was again being received through revelation, 
and the written record for many years hidden away was now restored, 
thus making the gospel more plain and restoring it in its fulness.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



These changed conditions required much thought, study and prepara- 
tion. Hyrum Smith's work by way of preparation was to first 
keep the commandments with all his might, mind and strength, to 
study the word of the Lord: that which had been given and that 
which was about to be given. He was to seek not for riches but for 
wisdom, and the promise was that through his faithfulness, "the 
mysteries of God shall be unfolded unto you and then shall you be 
made rich. Behold, he that hath eternal life is rich." And, after 
he had proven his faith by his works, then should his tongue be loosed, 
then if he desired he could have the Spirit and word and the power of 
God unto the convincing of men, and all things were to be added 
thereunto. From this we see the importance the Lord places on the 
need of humility; the importance of keeping the commandments and 
being prepared for the work called to do. This has been taught to 
me all my life and because of the teachings of my parents and the 
opportunity I have had for gaining knowledge, I have been highly 
blessed, and should have been better prepared for service in the 
ministry. I have discovered that faith, a sincere effort to keep the 
commandments, and a careful study of the gospel are not sufficient 
but are steps to service, which is the final and greatest qualifying 
feature in the Church. 

Service may be rendered in an indifferent or haphazard manner 
or as a matter of course, or daily act following fixed habits. When 
so rendered the greatest good is not accomplished. 

At the death of my father, I began to realize more and more 
how much I had depended upon him ; for it was easy to ask advice ; 
to get information on points of doctrine; all of which has been 
helpful, but not having him to rely upon I have been impressed more 
forcibly that it is necessary for each individual to stand firmly upon 
his own foundation. I am beginning to see more and more that 
the great value in having knowledge is to prepare one to render greater 
service, which is measured by the faith and diligence with which that 
service is performed. The Lord has shown the way and provided 
wisely that each one may have an opportunity of gaining knowledge, 
and of rendering service in his Church. His plan is perhaps not 
wholly effective, because of our carelessness and failure to fully do 
our part as leaders, nevertheless, the opportunity is given, subject 
to our acceptance. 

There are two priesthoods : The Melchizedek and Aaronic or 
Lesser Priesthood. The Melchizedek Priesthood deals with spiritual 
things, and the Aaronic, with the preparatory gospel. It has fallen to 
my lot to labor in the Aaronic Priesthood, with the young men holding 
the office of priest, teacher and deacon ; helping them in their en- 
deavor to lay a firm foundation upon which they may build, that 
further knowledge and .service may be acquired. How wisely has 
the Lord provided for them. As deacons, the boys are expected to 
perform labors in keeping with their age and knowledge, thus they 



ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 



23 



gain further knowledge; through service and study, encouraged by 
their officers and the Saints, in time they are prepared for greatei 
service and so advance to the office of teacher. Here their mission 
is to "watch over the Church always, and be with and strengthen 
them : 

"And see that the Church meet together often, and also see that all the 
each other, neither lying, backbiting, nor evil speaking: 

"And see that the Church meet together often, and also see that all the 
members do their duty." 

This labor is to be among those who believe in the gospel, and 
who understand that it is their mission to help these young men to gain 
the experience necessary, in the spirit of love, having a respect for 
them and a desire to encourage them in their work. This encourage- 
ment and labor, comes to them during a trying period in a boy's 
life, being privileged to watch over the Church, to see that there is 
no iniquity, lying, back-biting and evil speaking, and to see that the 
Church meet together often, and that all members do their duty. 

I cannot conceive of any greater protection that can come to 
a young man and no greater opportunity for growth, and the gain- 
ing of knowledge, than in rendering this service, under the direction 
of wise leaders and kind Church members. With a few years of 
such training, they should be qualified for greater service, and when 
ordained to the office of priest, they are expected to preach, teach, 
expound, exhort, baptize, administer the sacrament and to visit the 
homes of each member, and exhort them to pray vocally and in secret. 
This labor too, is with the members who are or should be .sympathetic 
and anxious to encourage them in their preparation for greater 
responsibility which comes with the Melchizedek Priesthood. With 
this training, step by step, the young men grow in knowledge 
and experience, and in due time they learn to put their trust in the 
Spirit of the Lord, which leadeth to do good and to do justly, and 
if they work humbly, the promise is to them also, and they are en- 
titled to the enlightening influence of the Spirit, which shall fill our 
souls with joy. 

I am grateful, my brethren and sisters, for the opportunity I 
have of laboring in this Church. I am grateful that it has fallen to 
my lot to labor among the young men, and I pray that the importance 
of this work will be impressed upon us, that we may encourage those 
holding the Lesser Priesthood and provide employment for them, even 
more than we have been doing in the past. During the last year there 
has been greater activity in the Lesser Priesthood work than in any other 
year in the history of the Church. There is room for greater de- 
velopment ; for greater work and activity, and the boys need it. Upon 
thos holding the Melchizedek Priesthood rests the responsibility of 
providing this training. May God help us to do so, I humbly pray in 
the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ELDER JOHN M. KNIGHT 

(President of the Western States Mission) 

My brethren and sisters, it is a real pleasure to be here on this 
occasion and bear testimony to the truthfulness of the gospel as taught 
by the Latter-day Saints. The remarks of our brethren this morn- 
ing have impressed me with the importance of having a personal, living 
testimony of the divine mission of Jesus Christ, that he is the very Son 
of God, the Savior of the world ; and also a testimony that Joseph 
Smith, the latter-day prophet, was raised up by the Lord to usher in 
a new gospel dispensation. 

I know that the gospel we preach is not after man; we have 
not followed cunningly devised fables, Joseph Smith did not receive 
it of man, but by the revelations of Jesus Christ. We have received 
the witness of the Spirit that the gospel taught by the Latter-day 
prophet is verily the power of God unto salvation. The Savior said, 
"My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me. If any man will do 
his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or 
whether I speak of myself." So, today, as missionaries we lay down 
the gauntlet and say to all men, that if they will do the will of the 
Father, obeying the principles of the gospel as we teach them, they 
shall know of the doctrine, whether it is of God or whether we speak 
of ourselves. Then will they receive the witness of the Holy Ghost 
whom God hath promised to all those who obey him. You will 
remember the occasion when Peter and companions appeared before 
the council at Jerusalem. The high priest asked them, saying; "Did 
we not straitly command you that ye should not teach in this name ?" — 
Peter and the other apostles answered and said, "We ought to obey 
God rather than men. The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom 
ye slew and hanged on a tree. Him hath God exalted with his right 
hand to be a Prince and a Savior, for to give repentance to Israel, 
and forgiveness of sins. And we are his witnesses of these things ; 
and so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that 
obey him." Acts 5 :28-32. Paul in writing to the Corinthian Saints, 
said, "Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking 
■by the Spirit of God, calleth Jesus accursed : and that no man can 
say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost." 

It is important, therefore, as pointed out here today, that parents 
in Zion shall teach their children the fundamentals of the gospel, 
that as they grow in years they may grow in a knowl- 
edege of the truth ; and, having received the Holy Ghost 
by the laying on of hands, they may have the right to 
claim this testimony from our heavenly Father for he has said, 
"I the Lord am bound, when ye do what I say ; but when ye do not 
what I say ye have no promise." Surely the Lord will impart unto 
us according to our obedience. 

I thank God with all my soul that it is my privilege to bear 



ELDER JOHN M. KNIGHT 



25 



testimony to the divine mission of Jesus Christ, that he is the very 
Son of God, the Redeemer of the world; that by and through him, 
salvation will come to all the children on the earth. There is no other 
name given under heaven whereby we may be saved. I am grateful 
for the testimony that has come into my life that Joseph Smith was, 
and is, a Prophet of the living God. It was not my good fortune 
to know him in the flesh, but those who knew and associated with him 
in life, did not know any better than I know that his mission was 
divine. I appreciate the privilege of giving service today in this 
great cause, and bear you my testimony that the message we have for 
the world is the power of God unto salvation. We shall receive the 
companionship of the Holy Spirit in direct proportion to our obed- 
ience to the commandments given unto us. May the Lord give us 
power to live the gospel, to be exemplary in our lives, and to bear 
testimony to all with whom we come in contact that Jesus is the 
Christ, and that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God I pray, in the 
name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang, "Do what is right." 
Benediction was pronounced by Elder Lars P. Oveson, president 
of the Emery stake of Zion. 

Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock. 



AFTERNOON SESSION 

President Heber J. Grant presided and at 2 o'clock announced the 
hymn, "High on the mountain top," which was sung by the choir and 
congregation. 

Prayer was offered by Elder John W. Hart, president of the 
Rigby stake of Zion. 

The choir and congregation sang, "Redeemer of Israel." 

PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAWSON 

My brethren and sisters, I desire an interest in your faith and 
prayers that I may be led to say something that will be profitable 
to us this afternoon. We had a very choice meeting this morning. 
The Spirit of the Lord was with us, and will doubtless continue to 
be with us to the end of this great conference. 

HOW SHALL WE OBTAIN LIFE ETERNAL ? 

I take it, my brethren and sisters, that the great aim you have 
in view is to obtain life eternal. What is life eternal ? The Apostle 
Paul tells us: "And this is life eternal, that they might know thee, 
the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent." If we 
will analyze this passage of scripture we will see very clearly the 
reason for his statement. God is the author of eternal life, and this

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



great gift is given untp men through his beloved Son. That being the 
case, it is very important that we should come to know these divine 
beings, that we should come close to them and know something of 
their attributes and of their characters. The question follows naturally, 
if we come to know them, how, then, shall we obtain life eternal? 
Undoubtedly, it will come to us through the knowledge of the Holy 
Ghost. The Holy Ghost expresses the will of God to the human mind, 
so that those who receive it shall know how to act and walk before 
him. John the Revelator tells us in chapter 14 of the Gospel of St. 
John: "But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the 
Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring 
all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you." 

THROUGH THE GIFT OF THE HOLY GHOST 

It is this great power and gift that puts men into close 
relationship to God on high and to his beloved Son, so that they may 
have his mind and will. And it is that very principle of power 
that draws the people of God together and unites them in the bonds 
of fellowship and love. If we look out into the world — the so- 
called Christian world — and take note of the confusion, of the spirit 
of strife, and contention, and division which prevail there, we are at 
once driven to the conclusion that they are without this great gift 
of God, the Holy Ghost, and surely we may well believe that it 
is so ; because they have entirely neglected the ordinance of the Holy 
Ghost. 

This doctrine of the Holy Ghost was strongly emphasized by 
the Savior himself and by his apostles. Peter said : "Be baptized 
every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of 
sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost." 

NO BAPTISM COMPLETE WITHOUT THIS GIFT 

Now it is very apparent that any baptism that is given without 
the power and gift of the Holy Ghost is not a complete baptism. It 
is deficient. 

The Lord said upon one occasion: "And if a kingdom 
be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand. And if 
a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand." And 
we may well add as a corollary : That church which is divided 
against itself cannot stand. 

FUNDAMENTALISM AND MODERNISM 

There is great division in the churches of the world today. The 
following word came over wire by the Associated Press sometime ago, 
from New York City: "Modernists and fundamentalists today pressed 
their ecclesiastical warfare, with New York the chief battleground. 
In all, five Christian denominations, Protestant Episcopal, Pres- 
byterian, Baptists, Methodist, and Unitarian, have been drawn into 
doctrinal debate concerning chiefly the virgin birth of Jesus Christ, 
and physical resurrection." I mention this fact because it is of com- 



PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAW SON 



27 



mon knowledge and was published to the world in the daily papers, 
so I think it is appropriate to speak of it in a public way: 

"While debate has progressed furthest in the Protestant Episcopal 
church, where charges of heresy have been made, it became known that 
Presbyterian modernists, defeated in the general assembly last May, were 
planning vigorously to oppose adoption of five tenets held by funda- 
mentalists. 

"In a great or less degree, clergymen associated with the Baptist, 
Methodist and Unitarian sects have taken sides in the question of modernism 
versus fundamentalism. Next Thursday evening, for example, the Rev. 
Dr. John Roach Stratton, pastor of the Calvary Baptist church and funda- 
mentalist leader, debates the question with the Riev. Dr. Charles F. Potter, 
pastor of the West Side Unitarian church. 

"But with these rumblings in the other Protestant faiths distinctly 
audible, the chief engagement in progress today was between the Episcopalian 
factions." 

The question arises naturally : What is fundamentalism and what 
is meant by modernism? Here is the fundamental position. 

The five articles of faith, as outlined in resolutions adopted by 
the Presbyterian General Assembly at Indianapolis on May 23, last, 
affirm "That it is the essential doctrine of the church that the holy 
Spirit inspired the writers of the Bible to keep from error ; that 
Jesus Christ was born of the Virgin Mary ; that he offered himself 
as a sacrifice to atone for the sins of his followers ; and that he arose 
from the dead with the same body in which he suffered; and he 
showed his divine power by working miracles." 

Here is the modernist position : 

"God is an intelligence and a personality, but not in human form and 
is bodyless. He reveals himself in all nature, but is spirit and apart from 
matter. 

"Heaven has no pearly gates, harps or hosannas. 

"Hell has no fire. The devil is an invention of the Zoroastrian. 

"Prayer will never put a loaf of bread in the starving man's box, 
unless some human being intervenes. 

"Immortality will not be in the flesh. Personal identity will endure, 
but there will be no resurrection of the body. 

"Belief in the Virgin birth is not essential. 

"The miracles of the Old Testament are myths. Those of the New 
Testament were interpolated. Magic is not becoming to the character 
of Christ. 

"The phrase 'ascension into heaven' was written in the creed by a 
man who thought heaven was upstairs of a flat earth." 

And then another minister declares that the Christian era is at 
an end: 

"The end of the Christian Era has come, and mankind has entered 
the scientific era, in the opinion of Dr. Algernon Sidney Crapsey, who 
was convicted of heresy by the Episcopal church seventeen years ago. 

"He is taking a keen interest in the present controversy between 
modernists and fundamentalists and the approaching trial of Dr. Lee W. 
Heaton of Fort Worth, who is accused of denying the Virgin birth of 
Christ. 

"One-third of the Episcopal clergymen do not believe the story of 



28 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



the Virgin birth, the story of the origin of man or that the world was 
created in six days," he said. 

" 'In my case,' he continued, 'the court was picked to convict, and did 
so. That will happen in this case if there is a trial, but I believe such a 
storm of protest will break upon the bishops that they will not dare have 
a trial.' 

" 'In my trial the church refused to enter into the truth of matters. 
It set intellectual belief above intellectual truth. 

" 'If Dr. Heaton is tried the trial will condemn a single man and leave 
one-third of the church believing what the condemned man believed. It will 
take from the church what little moral power it has left. 

" 'The Christian era is at an end, and the church is in the course 
of dissolution. We are in the scientific era. 

" 'Thinking men do not believe the story of the Virgin birth. They 
do not believe the literal story of the resurrection. They do not believe 
that Balaam's ass turned around and said to him: "What are you doing 
there?" Science proves the world was not created in six days. The healings 
of Christ may be accepted, for they were not miracles.' " 

THE SCRIPTURE PLAIN ON THE POINTS IN CONTROVERSY 

Now you see, brethren and sisters, how very far apart the Christian 
ministers are in the same church, and as between the churches. They 
are drawing apart, they are disunited, they fail to see the light. This 
is evidence to me that they have not the gift of the Holy Ghost with 
them to enlighten their minds and to direct their course. 

Now, the scriptures are exceedingly plain on some of these points 
that are being discussed and which may end in the rending of the 
Christian churches of today. Take for instance, the birth of Christ. 
This incident is given in the simplest language. You will find in Luke : 

THE BIRTH OF CHRIST 

"And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found 
favor with God. 

"And, behold, thou shalt conceive in the womb, and bring forth a Son, 
and shalt call his name Jesus. 

"He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: 
and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David: 

"And he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever; and of his kingdom 
there shall be no end. , 

"Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know 
not a man? 

"And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall 
come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: 
therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called 
the Son of God." 

How direct, how beautiful, how forceful, is this language, to 
tell us of the birth of the Savior of the world. How is it possible, 
brothers and sisters, to misunderstand such language? You can only 
account for it by the absence of the Spirit, for the Spirit of God 
testifies that that is the truth. 

THE RESURRECTION OF THE CHRIST 

With respect to the resurrection, this great principle is quite as 
beautifully set forth, as clearly defined, as that concerning which I 



PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAW SON 



29 



have read. These words occur in the Gospel of St. Matthew, 28th 
chapter. 

"And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for 
I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified. 

"He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where 
the Lord lay. 

"And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead: 
and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, 
I have told you. 

"And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great 
joy; and did run to bring his disciples word. 

"And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, 
All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him." 

And in chapter 27: "And the graves were opened; and many bodies of 
the saints which slept arose, 

"And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the 
holy city, and appeared unto many." 

Here is the testimony of the scriptures respecting this great doc- 
trine of the resurrection. 

THE UNITED FAITH OF THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS 

Now, brethren and sisters, I refer with some pride, but not in a 
boasting spirit, to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
You will remember the testimony that was borne by President Grant 
this morning, when he .said that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints was never in better condition, in that a greater degree 
of unity has never existed in the Church than at the present time; 
and this, after one hundred years. The Church is more united. I 
think without doubt the Latter-day Saints see more clearly, eye to eye, 
understand more fully and completely the principles of the holy gospel, 
than ever they did in their lives before. This is easily explained 
in what I have already said — the gift of the Holy Ghost is given 
with every baptism into our Church. We emphasize faith ; we speak 
of the importance of repentance ; we point to the necessity of baptism 
by immersion for the remission of sins, and the laying on of hands 
for the gift of the Holy Ghost — the spirit of truth. It is that spirit 
which draws the Latter-day Saints together and unites and cements 
them, so to speak, in a solid body. I rejoice in this testimony. 

PERSONAL TESTIMONY 

After an experience in the ministry of thirty-six years, I testify 
to you my brethren and sisters, that I do know positively that Jesus 
is and was the Christ, and that he was crucified for the sins of the 
world, for you and for me; and it is through that great sacrifice 
and our own good works that we will be saved, and not otherwise. 

And I testify to you of the Virgin birth — that Jesus was the 
Only Begotten Son of God in the flesh — and I have no doubt 
that this is the testimony of every Latter-day Saint in this building, 
that we see eye to eye upon this subject, that we agree perfectly in 
respect to this great doctrine of the resurrection. We go down into 



30 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



our graves, we expect to come up out of our graves, and take up 
these bodies purified, and go on to exaltation and glory. 

I testify to you that I do know that Joseph Smith was and is a 
prophet of God, and a great prophet of God, a mighty man. He 
was the man who founded this Church and kingdom under the direc- 
tion of the Holy Spirit, and by the power of the Holy Priesthood 
that was given to him. Great was that man. Now, I rejoice in these 
things beyond measure, and I pray God, the eternal Father, that he 
will continue to bless this people and strengthen them and unite them 
together by the power of his Spirit, that we may be able to accomplish 
the work which is required at our hands. This I testify to you, and 
this blessing I ask in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, Amen. 

A soprano solo, "My Redeemer," was sung by Miss Arline Ridges, 
a granddaughter of Brother Ridges, who was the original builder of 
the Tabernacle organ. 

ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 

I feel very keenly, my brethren and sisters, the responsibility, in 
addressing this large congregation. I believe that the prayers and faith 
of good men and women avail much with the Lord, and I therefore 
ask that you give to me your sympathy and your faith and prayers, 
that I may be able to bring forth something that will be worthy your 
consideration. 

CONDITIONS MADE KNOWN BY STATISTICS 

In the Presiding Bishop's Office of the Church, there are kept 
and compiled many important statistics, and these statistics give to the 
authorities of the Church, who choose to consider them, an under- 
standing of conditions which it would be next to impossible to acquire 
through visiting in the Church, in the various stakes of Zion. We 
have had some of these statistics presented by our President, in the 
opening session of this conference, and I desire to call attention to 
some others, briefly, which indicate conditions which are in need of 
being improved or corrected; conditions with respect to which per- 
haps the great majority of the people are not informed. For example: 

LARGE NUMBER OF UNMARRIED IN THE CHURCH 

From the reports of 1923, we are informed that there are in the 
Church 27,104 members of the Church over 21 years of age who have 
never been married. When you think that this large tabernacle will 
seat about eight thousand people, multiply that number by three and 
one-half, or nearly so, to equal the number of unmarried people in 
the Church over twenty-one years of age, it is almost appalling! And 
then, if we were to add to that number the young women of the Church, 
between the ages of 18 and 21, who might be said to be of marriagable 
age. the number would be increased by some thousands. 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 31 

I 

WHY IS THIS CONDITION? 

Why is this condition in the Church we may ask? And if it is 
in need of being remedied, how can it best be accomplished? We, as 
a people, believe in marriage. It is with us a religious principle. In- 
deed, we believe in marriages such as the Lord has revealed ; that we 
should be sealed, for time and eternity, by those having the sealing 
power. We are informed that such marriages as are performed in 
our temples are necessary for men and women to obtain a fulness of 
glory and exaltation in the celestial kingdom of our Father in Heaven ; 
for those who attain to that glory are to have a continuation of the 
seeds, forever, an eternal increase. Why then should there be so many 
members of the Church of marriageable age who are not married? I 
am led to wonder if we are partaking of the spirit of the world in this 
thing; for if I am correctly informed there are religionists who believe 
that in the practice of celibacy they can get nearer to the Lord, that 
they can minister more satisfactorily to him in the unmarried state 
than in the married relation. I am sure that this is a great mistake, 
an untrue doctrine. 

FORBIDDING TO MARRY, A DOCTRINE OF DEVILS 

Indeed, I think I might say that it is a doctrine of devils, and I 
would quote to you from the Scriptures to sustain my understanding 
of this doctrine. The Apostle Paul, in his epistle to Timothy ( 1 Tim. 
4:1-3), says : 

"Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall 
depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils ; 
Speaking lies in hypocrisy ; having their conscience seared with a hot iron : 
Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath 
created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the 
truth." 

Here the Apostle Paul characterizes this forbidding to marry as 
a doctrine of devils, as I understand it, along with lies in hypocrisy, 
and one of the great evils that should characterize the falling away from 
the truth in the last days. I hope as Latter-day Saints we are not 
imbibing those worldly ideas ; for we have been called out of the world, 
as we read in Revelations 18 :45 : 

"And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my 
people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her 
plagues. 

"For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her 
iniquities." 

EXEMPLARS TO THE WORLD 

We are expected to be exemplars unto the world of mankind, in 
all things that are good, right and righteous, and thus be preachers of 
the truth by example as well as by precept. There is no justification 
that I can find in the Scriptures for the non-belief in marriage as a 



32 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

i 

principle and ordinance of salvation, but on the contrary we find 
the Apostle Paul teaching the Hebrews that marriage is honorable in 
all ; and in a revelation to the Prophet Joseph Smith, known as the 49th 
Section of the Doctrine and Covenants, we find the Lord's own words : 
"Whoso forbiddeth to marry is not ordained of God, for marriage is 
ordained of God unto man." 

And in Genesis 2:18: "And the Lord God said, It is not good 
that the man should be alone." 

I would ask who knows better than the Lord what is good for 
man ; and what is good for man is good for woman, and it is not good 
that woman should be alone. 

In Genesis, the 5th chapter, I read this : "Male and female created 
he them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam." 

That is a rather peculiar expression "called their name Adam." 
The author of the Compendium, commenting on that expression, says 
that man in his fulness is a two-fold organization, male and female; 
either being incapable of filling the measure of their creation, alone. 
It requires a union of the two to complete man in the image of God. 

TWO KINDS OF MARRIAGES AUTHORITY 

There are two kinds of marriages particularly taken note of in the 
statistics of the Church ; one we call temple marriage, and the other 
civil marriage. Temple marriages, however, are civil marriages in 
that they comply with all the requirements of the civil law ; but temple 
marriages have other important elements in them that the civil mar- 
riage, performed outside of the temples, have not. For instance, the 
individual solemnizing these temple marriages must have authority. 
He who holds the keys, the President of the Church, delegates this 
authority to man to seal on earth and it shall be sealed in heaven, for 
he has received this authority and has the right to delegate it to those 
who are worthy, as he may elect. 

We read in Matthew 18:18 the following: "Whatsoever ye shall 
bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose 
on earth shall be loosed in heaven." 

This is by the Savior unto his disciples ; and they who held that 
sealing and loosing power visited the Prophet Joseph Smith and Oliver 
Cowdery, in the spring of 1829, on the banks of the Susquehanna river, 
and there conferred that authority upon them, and they in turn nave 
conferred it upon others. So these marriages performed in the temples 
are by those who have been thus authorized to speak for the Lord, 
and the individuals contracting marriage under these circumstances 
covenant most solemnly with each other to be husband and wife for 
time and for all eternity, as contrasted with the civil marriage cove- 
nant "until death do them part." The ceremony is of that character 
making the man and the woman husband and wife for time and for 
all eternity, so that these civil marriages, after all, are, we might say, 
but trial marriages ; and it would seem so from the fact that there are 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 



33 



so many of our Church members who accept of a civil marriage cere- 
mony before coming to the temple, and then later come to the temple 
to be sealed. 

MARRIAGE FOR ETERNITY 

I remember on one occasion when I was associated with the presi- 
dency of the Tooele stake, a prominent non-member of the Church 
requested me to perform the marriage ceremony for him. He was about 
to marry a beautiful woman, but before the ceremony was performed 
he called me to one side and said : "Now, Mr. Richards, don't make 
this thing too solid. We don't know whether we will be able to live 
together happily or not." That represents, I fear, the feeling ot too 
many men and women who enter into these solemn obligations of mar- 
riage outside of the Church, as compared with those who marry in the 
temple, for these marry with the thought of never separating, of mak- 
ing themselves congenial, yielding here and there where it is necessary, 
and fulfiling the law that they may be one in time and throughout all 
eternity. The statistics of the Church go to show that those marriages 
performed in the temple are more enduring. There are more divorce- 
ments following civil marriages, more than half as many more, than 
there are following temple marriages according to the statistics of the 
Church. 

TEMPLE AND CIVIL MARRIAGES IN THE CHURCH CONTRASTED 

I might give you in detail the average per year for the last five 
years, and I will say here that it is a deplorable thing that since 1919 
the civil marriages have outnumbered the temple marriages in the 
Church each year. The average number of temple marriages in the 
Church per year for the last five years is two thousand nine hundred 
and forty-six. The average number of civil marriages is three thou- 
sand two hundred and thirty-four. The divorcements after temple 
marriages, eighty-four; and the divorcements after civil marriages, 
one hundred fifty; or, in other words, one divorcement to every twenty- 
one civil marriages in the Church, and one divorcement to every thirty- 
six temple marriages. It is my belief that those very reasons, which 
might be assigned for members of the Church not going to the temple 
for marriage, are the causes of many unhappy marriages and the evil 
of divorce does not tell the whole story of sorrow which follows. Only 
those who in sorrow and disappointment have reached the climax and 
can endure the conditions no longer, receive divorcements. Many 
others suffer on and endure it for the sake of their children or others 
who are concerned. 

PEOPLE OF ONE RELIGIOUS FAITH SHOULD MARRY 

From the great number of men and women in the Church who 
have not been married, more than twenty-seven thousand, it would 
seem that those within the Church who do marry ought to be able to 
find companions without having to go outside of the Church. I want 



34 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



to tell you that while some of those marriages, where they are of dif- 
ferent faiths, may result in happiness, the great majority of them, I 
believe, result in disappointment, and sorrow, if not in divorcements. 
We would, therefore, advise our Latter-day Saint girls and Latter-day 
Saint boys to marry those of their own faith, and we would also advise 
those who are not of us to marry those of their own faith. 

WE WANT OUR PEOPLE TO MARRY 

Then there is one other thought that I want to leave with you: 
brethren and sisters, we want our people to marry. It would be a 
serious thing in my family if I had a son or a daughter that should 
grow up without marrying. We want the parents to use their influ- 
ence to have their children marry and let them marry young, when the 
spirit of courtship and marriage is upon them, and then we want them, 
of course, to marry in the Church, in the right way; and when they 
are married they should fulfil the law which God has given, to mul- 
tiply and replenish the earth. That is the thing which many, I feel, 
are not doing today, to the full, and it is my firm conviction that the 
time will come when those who are not doing their full duty will know 
the loss which they are sustaining, and it will be hell and torment to 
many of them. Now, we know that some cannot bear children, and 
some because of weakness are not able to do as much as others. God 
knows. I believe in the doctrine of the Scripture, that children are 
an heritage from God, and happy is the man that hath his quiver full 
of them. And I believe in the saying of the Prophet Joseph that when 
God offers a man a blessing and he refuses to accept or receive that 
blessing, that man is damned. I believe that our Father has these chil- 
dren to give to us, and I believe that if we do not accept them we will 
meet with this . disappointment. A little girl, eleven or twelve years 
of age, said to her mother one day: "Mother, why did you have so 
many children ? When I grow up and get married I will not have so 
many children." Then the mother said to her : "My daughter, let us 
see. You are number fourteen. Suppose I had quit having children 
when I had thirteen, where would you have been, and where would 
your little brother have been?" Of course the little girl had not thought 
of it in that way. We value our children above price. A million dol- 
lars would not purchase ojie of them. There will come a time just 
as sure as we live, brethren and sisters, when we will know what we 
might have had and what we have not received, where we have re- 
jected the offer from a kind and loving Father, so that we may then 
say with the poet, "Of all sad words of tongue or pen, the saddest are 
these : it might have been." 

God bless you, my brethren and sisters. May he help us to see 
and understand these principles, to have faith and courage to live them, 
that we may be saved, and be an example in these things to our chil- 
dren, worthy of their emulation, I pray, in the nar«e of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY 
"ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY 



35 



It is just three years since I last stood before a congregation in 
a General Conference of the Church. Perhaps some of you would like 
to know how I have been spending the time, Bill Nye, the American 
humorist, was asked by a correspondent about his habits of life and 
methods of work — how he employed his time, and so forth. He an- 
swered : "I do most of my writing in a sitting posture or in an auto- 
graph album. 1 belong to an athletic club and a pair of Indian clubs. 
When I am not engaged in thought, I am employed in recovering from 
its effects." My case is somewhat similar, or at least that is sug- 
gestive of my case. I have been absent three years. Half of that time 
I was filling a mission in a foreign land. During the other half I have 
been "recovering from its effects." Not the effects of my mission, 
either; but the effects of illness, which put an end to my mission and 
made necessary my return much earlier than I had anticipated. 

MISSION TO EUROPE 

I left Salt Lake City, bound for Europe, on the 24th of May, 1921, 
and landed at Liverpool in the early days of June. My wife went with 
me. also a party of missionaries, including' Elder William A. Morton, 
who was to assist me in the editorial department of the Millennial Star. 
I had been appointed to succeed Elder George Albert Smith as Presi- 
dent of the European Mission, the affairs of which he turned over to 
me on the first day of July. Early that month, at a special convention 
of mission and conference presidents called for the purpose, I obtained 
further knowledge of the affairs of the Church in the British Islands 
and adjacent countries. 1 had previously visited, in company with 
President Smith, a few of the English conferences, and had been in- 
troduced by him to quite a number of prominent men, including 
journalists, police authorities, steamship magnates, a W r elsh member of 
Parliament, the Lord Mayor of Liverpool, and the American and Ger- 
man consuls ; so that when he sailed for home I had matters fairly well 
in hand. 

PREACHING ON THE CONTINENT 

Soon after his departure I made a tour of some of the Continental 
mission fields, accompanied by my wife and two of the Elders — 
Thomas M. Wheeler and Arthur II. Taylor, both choice men, the 
former the mission secretary. We passed through France, Switzerland, 
Germany, Belgium and Holland, attending conferences and holding 
special meetings in many of the principal cities. The Elders and Saints 
welcomed us joyfully, and large numbers of strangers flocked lo hear 
what we had to say. Our largest gathering was in the Casino Music 
Hall, Berlin, where we addressed congregations, afternoon and evening, 
numbering twelve hundred and thirteen hundred people, about two- 
thirds of them non-members of the Church. They paid strict atten- 
tion, only one interruption occurring, and that of a perfectly respect- 



36 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ful character. While I was speaking and my remarks were being in- 
terpreted "line upon line" by one of the German brethren, a young 
man arose in the body of the hall and politely requested the interpreter 
to speak less rapidly, as he wished to "get the points." Another 
auditor was the organist of the Kaiser's Church in Berlin ; he attended 
our afternoon meeting, and volunteered an organ solo for the evening 
session. Everywhere we were treated with the greatest kindness and 
courtesy. Quite a change from the days when the Saints in Germany, 
in order to evade the police, had to meet secretly in small groups in 
private homes, with the blinds drawn ; and when the Elders, if caught 
preaching anywhere in that country, were imprisoned or banished sum- 
marily. We found the work of the Lord prospering in that mission 
anri in the Netherlands, under the efficient labors of Elders Serge F. 
Ballif and John P. Lillywhite, the presiding brethren, and their faith- 
ful helpers. 

SCENES OF INTEREST 

While in Paris we took an excursion to Rheims, where we viewed 
the shattered Cathedral, bombarded by German guns during the Great 
War; and thence, for several miles, traversed the famous "Hinden- 
burg Line," passing through the remains of French villages desolated 
by the fearful strife. The scenic wonders of Switzerland, "the castled 
crags" and terraced vineyards of the Rhine, the famous field of Water- 
loo, and other objects of familiar interest to the tourist, I have not 
time to dwell upon. At Liege, in Belgium, we lunched at the home of 
the American counsul, George M. Hanson of Ogden, Utah, and in- 
spected, nine miles out, the ruins of Fort Loncin, whose heroic garrison 
made such a wonderful defense against the overwhelming Teutonic 
invasion of 1914. At Rotterdam, in Holland, I had the privilege of 
speaking from the pulpit of the little church where the Pilgrim Fathers 
held their farewell service, prior to embarking for America in 1620. 

AGAIN IN BRITAIN 

Having spent six weeks upon the Continent, we returned to Eng- 
land, landing at Harwich, and barely escaping the humiliation of being 
sent back to Holland to have our passports vised by the British consul, 
we having failed, through misinformation, to observe that formality. 
I had contracted a heavy cold in Holland, and for the next few days 
after my return to Liverpool, was disabled for active service. The 
fall and winter conferences of the British Mission — fourteen in num- 
ber, held one week apart — were just beginning, the first one in Ire- 
land, where things were in a turmoil, men being shot down every few 
minutes or so. I was kind-o'-glad I couldn't go, and Brother Morton 
was none too happy at being sent. But he went, and had a good time 
— there's always a good time where Brother Morton goes — and came 
back rejoicing; the return trip being particularly delightful. 
(Laughter.) The remainder of the conferences I was able to attend, 
and later I also visited the war-torn Emerald Isle.

AN ANTI-"MORMON" ATTACK 

With the opening of the New Year, a fierce anti-"Mormon" on- 
slaught began in many of the British newspapers; the "stunt press" 
they call it over there — the equivalent for "yellow journals" in Amer- 
ica. Twenty-six of them were barking at us simultaneously all over 
the land. During the next three months our pens and tongues were 
kept busy refuting the slanders with which the country was flooded, 
and presenting the facts in relation to Utah and her people. The 
principal charge made against the Elders was that of inducing young 
women to go to Utah for polygamous purposes. The only "evidence" 
adduced in support of this charge was a quotation from one of our 
Articles of Faith — an adaptation of the well known words of St. 
Paul : "If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or 
praiseworthy, we seek after these things." "These things," of course, 
were the British girls. The accusers of the brethren affected 
to regard this as a confession of guilt. Let me say here that 
the standing reward of two hundred pounds ($1,000) offered years 
ago by Mr. V. S. Peet, for one case of a British girl lured to Utah by 
"Mormon" influence, is still unclaimed. 

The intelligent classes were not deceived by the false reports 
spread abroad, many of which were so ridiculous as to carry with them 
their own refutation ; but they were accepted as true by the ignorant in- 
habitants of the slums, stirred up in some instances by ministers of 
the churches. One of our most active assailants was a minister who 
had been a Texas cowboy, but having inherited an English baronetcy, 
had returned to his native land, and been made the pastor of a church 
in London. This reverend gentleman had the audacity and mendacity 
to say to his Sunday congregation: "I have seen with my own eyes 
the bloodstained boulder at the back of Smith's house, freshly stained 
with the blood of rebellious girl converts." Another of his lurid 
tales was to the effect that the "Mormon" men killed off their old 
wives by giving them a strong alkali drink which destroyed them 
gradually, thus making way for younger wives, recruited through the 
labors of the missionaries. Needless to say, alkali was not the only kind 
of lie used in his statement. The British Government's chief aliens 
inspector, by direction of the Home Secretary, applied to me for data 
regarding "Mormon" missionary and emigrational activities, and the 
same was promptly furnished. I then asked him : "Is the Home Office 
agitated over the present outcry against us ?" Smilingly he answered : 
"Not at all ; we understand ; but we must be prepared, when pressure 
comes, to present the facts in reply." As for the. papers and the 
"movies," they made money out of the agitation, which of course was 
their principal object. When requested to publish replies to the sensa- 
tional canards, most of the editors or managers flatly refused. One 
of them said: "We are out to crush Mormonism at any cost." 

AH the Elders in the mission, and many of the Sisters, did splen- 



38 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



did service in repelling- this foul and unprovoked attack. Among its 
unpleasant results were the tarring and feathering of three Elders in 
Scotland, the smashing of the plate-glass windows of the London Con- 
ference house, and the temporary cessation of open-air meetings in 
some parts. But on the whole we were benefited by the assault ; it 
awakened interest in our cause, made friends for us, increased bap- 
tisms, and enhanced the attendance at our meetings. 

DUTIES OF MISSION PRESIDENT 

My time was fully occupied in editing the Star (ably assisted by- 
Brother Morton), in writing and publishing pamphlets setting forth 
our tenets and views, assigning and instructing missionaries, visiting 
the conferences, preaching wherever opportunity offered, and doing 
whatever else devolved upon the Mission President. I presented a 
handsome copy of the Book of Mormon to the Home Secretary, Mr. 
Shortt, and sent pamphlets and other literature to every member of 
Parliament and to all the leading men of Great Britain. I worked 
early and late, and as hard as my strength would permit — much of the 
time at a great disadvantage, owing to a physical ailment which had 
troubled me a long while, and for which, I am now convinced, I should 
have had an operation before leaving home. President Grant, who 
knew of it, had given me my choice, whether to go or not until such 
an operation was performed. I went without it, but after that strenu- 
ous year in the mission field, found that I could not safely put it off 
any longer. 

IN THE HOSPITAL 

Accordingly, after completing the round of the spring confer- 
ences in England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland, deferring (as I then 
thought temporarily ) a visit to the Scandinavian countries, I went up 
to London, entered a private hospital or "nursing home," and under- 
went the operation contemplated. 1 had first-class surgical attend- 
ance, but for some reason the operation was not entirely successful, 
and had to be repeated; the result being that I was detained in the 
"Home" for a much longer period than I had counted upon. Thirty 
days was said to be the usual time, but I lay there for nearly fourteen 
weeks, physically helpless, yet with mental faculties equal to the task 
of furnishing editorial articles for the Star, and corresponding with 
the brethren here at home and with those whom I had left in charge 
at Liverpool. My faithful wife was with me through it all. lightening 
by her daily visits and tender ministrations my burden of affliction. 
Finally, I emerged from the hospital, and after a ten days' rest at 
the hospitable home of Brother Ralph J. Pugh, who with his amiable 
wife had been exceedingly kind and attentive, I w r ent back to my post 
and resumed work — too soon, T found to my cost before many days 
had passed. I suffered a relapse, and became more helpless than 
ever. 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY

RELEASE AND RETURN 

Some weeks of misery went by and I then decided to come home, 
President Grant having given me an honorable release, with advice to 
return as soon as I could safely travel. On the 10th of November I 
sailed from Liverpool for Montreal, my wife and two Elders — Clyde 
Romney and Claude W. Hinckley — coming with me and caring for 
me all along the way. Never was invalid waited upon more faith- 
fully. I could not have done without their help, especially during our 
unfortunate and unlooked for detention in quarantine on a bleak island 
in the St. Lawrence River, within a day's distance of Montreal. Two 
hundred and forty first-class passengers, housed in immigrant barracks 
on that frozen, wind-swept rock, Gros Island — such was the situation. 
A case of smallpox on board was the cause, and fourteen days was 
the regular period of detention in such cases. But this was shortened 
for us to eight days, through the interest taken by leading brethren in 
Utah, and the influence exerted by Senator Smoot with the Canadian 
authorities. We were all vaccinated, and as fast as the vaccinations 
"took," were allowed to proceed on our way. A few other Elders and 
Saints, with us on the island, were released at about the same time. 
Every courtesy was extended by Government and railroad officials, 
both in Canada and the United States, and although the journey was 
a very trying one, we reached home in safety, December 7, 1922. 

GRADUAL CONVALESCENCE 

Since then I have been slowly convalescing back to health. I 
was told by a medical doctor soon after my return, that it would be 
eighteen months before I would "feel fit." The eighteen months are 
up this spring, and my condition is now almost normal. During the 
winter I have read a great deal, have done some writing, and in the 
past few weeks have spoken fourteen times in public. A year ago or 
more, I could neither read nor write, nor even think clearly. There 
was a weight upon my brain like an iron clamp, while in walking I 
felt as if I were lifting great chunks of lead. As for public speaking, 
that was entirely out of the question. Since walking has always been 
my favorite exercise, and reading, writing and speaking the occupa- 
tions in which I have taken most delight, you can judge of the amount 
of privation that my long sickness entailed. I can never be grateful 
enough to President Grant and other kind friends who have ministered 
to my needs in various ways during the saddest and loneliest period 
of my life. I am thankful for the many prayers offered up in my 
behalf — prayers that have been answered in a manner truly wonder- 
ful. I can only say: "It is the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in 
my eyes." 

THE SPEAKER'S TESTIMONY 

Brethren and sisters: I testify in all solemnity that I know this 
to be the work of the Lord. I never knew it so well as I do now. 



40 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



I have been just near enough to "the other side" to sense it most 
thoroughly, and my one desire is to live to bear testimony of the Truth. 
I do not testify that the Gospel is true ; that would be superfluous — a 
mere truism. One might as well say that truth is true, or that white 
is white, as to say that the Gospel is true. Of course it's true, or it 
wouldn't be the Gospel, which is Truth itself. But I do testify that 
what is called "Mormonism" is the Gospel — the Everlasting Gospel ; 
that Jesus Christ is the one and only Savior, and that Joseph Smith 
was and is his prophet, standing at the head of the last and greatest 
of the gospel dispensations, the mission of which is to gather together 
all things in Christ and prepare the way before His glorious second 
coming. I know that this work will go on conquering and to conquer — 
not with worldly but with spiritual weapons ; that nothing can stand 
against it to impede its progress ; and that it never will be smaller 
or weaker than it is today. Like the little snowball from the mountain- 
top, gathering as it goes, it will yet become a mighty avalanche, sweep- 
ing all evil before it, and fulfilling what the Prophet Daniel spoke 
concerning it. For it is "the stone cut out without hands" which is 
destined to grow into "a great mountain" and "fill the whole earth." 
God speed it on its way! Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 

My brethren and sisters, I am sure that the people here assembled, 
and throughout the stakes of Zion, are rejoicing in the remarkable re- 
covery that has come to Elder Orson F. Whitney. The hand of the 
Lord has been made manifest in his restoration to health. 

This afternoon I need your faith and prayers to assist me in the 
remarks that I shall make. 

WE STAND AS WITNESSES FOR CHRIST 

We are living in perilous times, in a day when the mission of the 
Church is perhaps more pronounced, and our message to the world 
more clearly defined, than ever before. As a people we stand as wit- 
nesses for Christ in a day when the world has turned from him, when 
they are teaching the doctrines of men and discarding the fundamental 
truths of the Christian faith. 

I have been reflecting, as I have listened to the remarks that were 
made this morning and this afternoon, and desire to present some of 
my thoughts, and some thoughts of others uttered by prophecy in an- 
cient times, which are very important to us and which concern very 
seriously the world and the conditions therein. My thoughts dwelt 
upon this passage of scripture which was uttered by Nephi almost 
six hundred years before the birth of Christ, wherein he was speaking 
of the latter days: 

TESTIMONY OF AN ANCIENT PROPHET 

"O that cunning plan of the evil one ! O the vainness, and the frailties, and 
the foolishness of men! When they are learned they think they are wise, and 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 



41 



they hearken not unto the counsel of God, for they set it aside, supposing they 
know of themselves, wherefore, their wisdom is foolishness and it profiteth 
them not. And they shall perish. 

"But to be learned is good if they hearken unto the counsels of God. 

"But wo unto the rich, who are rich as to the things of the world. For 
because they are rich they despise the poor, and they persecute the meek, and 
their hearts are upon their treasures; wherefore, their treasure is their god. 
And behold, their treasure shall perish with them also. 

"And wo unto the deaf that will not hear ; for they shall perish. 

"Wo unto the blind that will not sec; for they shall perish also." 

And then again in one of his discourses in which he spoke by 
prophecy, he also referred to our day and the conditions that would 
prevail in the world preceding the corning of Christ. 

"For it shall come to pass in that day that the churches which are built up, 
and not unto the Lord, when the one shall say unto the other : Behold, I, I am 
the Lord's ; and the others shall say : I, I am the Lord's ; and thus shall every 
one say that hath built up churches, and not unto the Lord — ■ 

"And they shall contend one with another ; and their priests shall contend 
one with another, and they shall teach with their learning, and deny the Holy 
Ghost, which giveth utterance. 

"And they deny the power of God, the Holy One of Israel; and they say 
unto the people : Hearken unto us, and hear ye our precept ; for behold there 
is no God today, for the Lord and the Redeemer hath done his work, and he 
hath given his power unto men." 

VIEWS OF THE SO-CALLED MODERNISTS 

President Clawson this afternoon read to us some views that are 
expressed today by certain ministers, religionists who call themselves 
modernists, and they appear to be in the ascendency ; their doctrines 
are growing, and are finding place in the hearts of the people, and 
the true doctrines of Christ, and the testimony that Jesns is the Son 
of God, is diminishing, is dying out in the world. Tt may be true, as 
one divine stated, that the Christian Era is at an end, and the Church 
is in the course of dissolution, if he had reference to the so-called 
Christian churches of the day; because their doctrine is spurious, it is 
not the gospel of Jesus Christ, but a man-made system. But Christ- 
ianity, pure and undefiled, is not in the course of dissolution ; it is not 
dying out, it is becoming more firmly rooted in the earth, and must do 
so, and shall continue until it shall fill the earth, for so it has been 
predicted. 

TRUE CHRISTIANITY 

However, true Christianity, so far as the latter days are con- 
cerned, is very young, less than one hundred years of age, for it has 
only been since the year 1830 that the Church of Jesus Christ has been 
organized in the earth, and the gospel restored, containing the gifts 
and the blessings and the graces that existed in the Church in primi- 
tive days, and that Church with its doctrines of the gospel of Christ, 
shall grow. 

We are the people who have made covenant with the Lord to 



42 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



serve him and keep his commandments, and we have received through 
the testimony of the Holy Spirit, the knowledge that Jesus is the 
Christ, the Son of the living God, that he is indeed the Only Begotten 
Son of the Father, and that through his Mood, which was shed, all men 
are redeemed from death, all men shall come forth in the resurrection 
from the dead and live again. In other words, immortality shall come 
to every soul, for, as Paul has stated it, "As in Adam all die, so in 
Christ shall all be made alive." "And," said he, "the last enemy that 
shall be destroyed is death," and so long as there is still in the grave 
one soul who has tabernacled in the flesh, death has not been con- 
quered. Death shall be conquered, Christ shall gain the victory, and 
immortality shall come to every soul that has lived upon the earth. 
And the reason for this is that we were not responsible for death ; we 
did not bring death into the world, and so we are redeemed through 
the blood of Christ, from that condition, and immortality shall come 
to us, both the unrighteous as well as the righteous, and all men 
shall stand again in the flesh to be judged according to their works. 
But in addition to all this, through the blood of Christ, men are also 
redeemed from their own sins ; but on condition of their repentance 
and their acceptance of the principles of the gospel. They must be- 
lieve in him, they must accept him as the Son of God, they must set 
themselves in harmony with the truth which we call the gospel. They 
must accept these principles and walk in accordance with them in 
order that they may be redeemed from their own sins, and thus be 
prepared to receive something greater than immortality, even eternal 
life. Eternal life is that kind of life which our Father in heaven 
possesses. For he who has eternal life must have the kind of life that 
God has, for he is eternal. And so those who will repent, who will 
receive the gospel, walking righteously before the Father, shall receive 
this great reward, and shall have the privilege of entering into his pres- 
ence and dwelling with him and with his Son, Jesus Christ, where they 
shall receive a fulness, if they are faithful and true in all things, even 
unto the end. 

OUR MESSAGE TO THE WORLD 

Now. I say we are witnesses of the truth. It is the mission of 
every man holding the priesthood in this Church to preach Christ and 
him crucified. That is our message to the world ; and the message is 
sorely needed in the face of these false doctrines taught by the power 
of men. When men are turning from the Lord and seeking to find 
everlasting truth without his aid, our mission 'becomes all the more 
urgent in calling men to repentance and to a belief in the redemption 
brought to pass through the atonement of the Son of God, whose blood 
was shed for the sins of the world. 

WE BELIEVE IN A LITERAL RESURRECTION 

We believe in the literal resurrection of the children of men. 
President Rudger Clawson read to us the statement that was made by 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 43 



Matthew, an eye witness of the resurrection of Christ, and many of 
the Saints who lived lief ore that day, who came forth from the dead 
after the resurrection of the Son of God. Matthew stated that "the 
graves were opened ; and many bodies of the Saints which slept, arose, 
and came out of the graves, after his resurrection, and went into the 
holy city, and appeared unto many." This was as literal as Ezekiel 
said it would be. so far as the resurrection of the bodies from the 
graves was concerned, there can be no mistake about that. Christ was 
the first fruits, and afterwards those who believed on him, and event- 
ually all men shall come forth. 

It is our message and our mission to the world, to preach this 
truth, and to establish faith in the hearts of the people, and endeavor to 
get them to believe in Jesus Christ as their Redeemer and as the Son 
of God. 

I would like to refer to one or two other passages of Scripture 
bearing upon this point of the resurrection. Ezekiel, one of the proph- 
ets of old, was commanded by the Lord in a vision to prophesy. In the 
vision he was taken out into a valley of dry bones, and they were very 
dry, and the Lord asked him the question: "Son of man, can these 
bones live?" And Ezekiel answered, "Thou knowest." So the Lord 
said to him : 

"Prophesy upon these bones, and say unto them, O ye dry bones, hear the 
word of the Lord. 

"Thus saith the Lord God unto these bones ; Behold, I will cause breath 
to enter into you, and ye shall live : 

"And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and 
cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know 
that I am the Lord. 

"So I prophesied as T was commanded : and as I prophesied, there was 
a noise, and beheld a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to his bone, 

"And when T beheld, lo, the sinews and the flesh came up upon them, ana 
the skin covered them above; but there was no breath in them. 

"Then said he unto mc, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of man. 
and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord Clod; Come from the four winds, O 
breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live." 

Now the world would tell you that this did not mean those who 
were dead literally, but those who were dead in sins, who, because of 
transgression, had been cut off from the Lord: but the Lord is very 
specific for we read further : 

"So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, 
and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army. 

"Then he said unto mc, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of 
Israel : behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and our hope is lost : we are cut 
off from our parts. 

"Therefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God; Beheld, 
O my people, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your 
graves, and bring you into the land of Israel. 

"And ye shall knew that I am the Lord, when I have opened your graves, 
O my people, and brought you up out of your graves." 

So the Lord was very definite in regard to this matter. There 
is no mistake about the definiteness of the language at all.

Isaiah, speaking of the resurrection, had this to say, in reference 
to Israel especially : 

"Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise. 
Awake .and sing, ye that dwell in dust; for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and 
the earth shall cast out the dead." 

Hosea has also testified as follows: 

"I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them 
from death: O death, I will be thy plague; O grave, I will be thy destruction: 
repentance shall be hid from mine eyes." 

MODERN TESTIMONY OF THE RESURRECTION 

A nd so have prophesied others of the ancient prophets ; and so 
have testified the witnesses of the New Testament; hut in addition to 
all these we have the witnesses who have lived in our own day. We 
are not in doubt, the Lord has not left us helpless to grope without 
the light. We have had in our midst, those who have beheld heavenly 
beings, messengers who have been sent to reveal the truth, who have 
passed through the resurrection; who have come forth from the dead, 
and are alive again. Joseph Smith, Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer, 
Martin Harris, and others, have testified to the world that they have 
been in the presence of beings who have come forth from the dead, 
through the resurrection. These personages lived anciently, and came 
to the earth again to establish the truth of the everlasting gospel. And 
the witnesses unto whom they came have testified to all the world that 
these things are true — that God lives, that Jesus Christ is the Redeemer 
of the world, and the first fruits of the resurrection. This testimony 
is binding on all the world, for these men are reliable witnesses. Men 
may say they do not believe it ; they may say there is no truth in it, but 
the fact remains that in bearing witness of these truths, the witnesses 
have complied with the law, and their testimony is now binding on all 
men. In the mouths of as many witnesses as seemeth good, God has 
established the truth of all things, and all who reject the testimony of 
these witnesses do so at the peril of losing their own salvation, for God 
will not be mocked. 

I testify that I know these things are true, and you who are 
assembled here know they are true. That is our mission and testimony, 
I repeat, unto all the world, to bear witness and cry repentance, that 
men may be brought to repentance and receive a remission of their sins 
through obedience to the principles of the gospel. May the truth spread 
and righteousness prevail, is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. „, : |; | j , j 

The choir and congregation sang, "The time is far spent, there 
is little remaining." 

Elder Joseph B. White, President of the Hyrum stake of Zion, 
offered the closing prayer, and the conference adjourned until 10 o'clock 
Saturday morning. 



SECOND DAY 

MORNING SESSION 

Promptly at 10 o'clock, Saturday, April 5, 1924, President Heber 
J. Grant announced that the choir and congregation would sing, "O 
say what is truth?" as the opening hymn. 

After the singing of the hymn, the opening prayer was offered 
by Elder Thomas D. Rees, President of the Juab stake of Zion. 

The choir and congregation sang, "How firm a foundation ye 
Saints of the Lord." 

All the seats were occupied and many people were standing in the 
aisles, both in the gallery and on the main floor. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

Of the General Authorities of the Church, there are absent fron^ 
our conference Elders Reed Smoot, David O. McKay, John A. Widtsoe, 
and George Albert Smith, of the Council of the Twelve. As you 
all know, Brother Smoot' s duties prevent his attendance. We had 
hoped Brother Widtsoe might be here, but the Commission of which 
he is a member demands his attention, and he has written his sincere 
regrets for not being present at the conference. We have a cablegram 
from Pres. David O. McKay, that "the conference presidents of the 
mission in special assembly send greetings to the First Presidency and 
other authorities and the Church at home. God bless you." Brother 
George Albert Smith is absent on account of sickness. We hope he 
will be with us before the conference is concluded. 

ELDER CHARLES W. NIBLEY 

(Presiding Bishop of the Church) 

Yesterday morning, as we were coming to conference and as the 
clouds betokened that we might have a storm, we heard on every hand 
the old saying, "Yes, its going to storm — the regular conference 
storm." Well, it did not storm, and to-day we have the most beauti- 
ful weather that could be found anywhere in the world. I do not 
know where you would go to equal it. So I feel happy this morning 
for the good weather with which we are blessed for our conference. 

I am grateful to the Lord for being permitted to labor with my 
brethren in connection with this great work, in which labor I have 
been engaged for many years, I rejoice in its growth and in its 
development, and I am glad to add my evidence or testimony to that 
of President Grant that I believe the Church, spiritually and temporally, 
is in a stronger, a better and more advanced condition to-day than it 
ever has been in its history. We are more numerous to-day than we 
ever have been and therefore we ought to be stronger, and are. 

I can speak, I believe, for the work that is under the care of 
the Presiding Bishopric of the Church, the work of the Lesser Priest- 
hood. I think I can safely say that never in the history of the Church 
has that work been in such good shape, nor has it been better looked 
after, nor indeed as well looked after by the bishops and those in 



46 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



charge of the responsibility of looking after the lesser priesthood, as 
it is to-day. So that also shows growth and development. Not- 
withstanding all that, we are far from doing and far from being what 
we should do and what we should be, but we are making progress, 
thank the Lord. 

This Church stands for all that is best in the world. If there is 
anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report, or praiseworthy, we seek 
after these things ; that which is best, that which makes for the suc- 
cess and prosperity and blessing of the people, that which extends 
and magnifies and upholds the principles of liberty. This Church 
has the gospel of Jesus Christ and according to St. Paul that system, 
that gospel is the perfect law of liberty, more perfect than anything 
else that has ever been devised, and I am thankful for that. I am 
grateful for this nation, for the privilege of living in this great nation, 
and that we are a part of it where there is more liberty for, and 
a better understanding of, human rights, and more of the respectful 
deference and tolerance for the views of others, religious Views, 
views of different questions, more of tolerance I say, in this nation 
than in any other nation under the sun. 

If you do not believe that, go and live awhile in the South 
American countries, or go down to Mexico, our neighbor on the south, 
or anywhere in Europe, Asia or Africa, anywhere outside of this nation, 
if you think you would be more contented than here, and you will 
come back and say, "This good old U. S. A., the United States of 
America, is the very best country, the very best nation, the very best 
people in all the world," and I am thankful that I am a partaker 
of it. 

This Church in its beneficence, in its helpfulness, goes far in its 
missionary activities, and the sacrifices that are made in that connection 
stamp the people with having done and trying to do better, and more 
in helping others and extending these principles, these blessings of 
liberty, than any other people in all the world. The missionary- 
activities are not only to our own race, the white race, but we have 
gone to the islands of the sea. This Church established, many years 
ago, on the Hawaiian Islands, schools, educational helps, teaching the 
people also how to work, how to live, how to establish themselves and 
be independent, and to practice the principles of righteousness and 
liberty and thrift which the gospel inculcates. The Church has sent 
tens of thousands of dollars there, helping those poor people, during 
the many years that have passed ; has done it recently and is doing- 
it now, during this adminstration of President Grant. 

Then again, down in New Zealand, the Church has established 
there an agricultural college to help the Maori people. Of the tithes, 
the means that you have contributed, money has been sent down there 
to help those people, to educate them, to teach them the way of life 
and to help them in many ways, which have been a blessing to them. 
So also in Samoa. So with the Indians, up here in Washakie. The 
Church has spent a considerable amount of money to help the Indians 
there, to teach them and to be a blessing to them — a few of the 



ELDER CHARLES W. NIB LEY 



47 



Papago Indians down in Arizona also ; a few down here at Cedar 
City and a few elsewhere who live around us. The Church has always 
been and is now helping in all these different directions, and it is a 
good work, a commendable work. I wanted to make a note of these 
items so that you may know, my brethren and sisters, how the means 
that you contribute to the Church are used. You have heard from 
the President how practically all the means contributed have been sent 
back to the people for schools, educational purposes, for the building 
of churches, for the operation and maintenance of church activities. 
Practically all of the tithes have been sent back to ihe people in the 
wards, in the stakes, for temples, for hospitals and in all these activities 
which are good, which are commendable and which are a blessing to 
the people. We should try to do a little more than we are doing, if 
we have, and we do have, the best principles to govern us, laid down 
by the Lord Almighty ; we have a knowledge that he established his 
work and that he raised up wise men, as he says in one of the re- 
velations, for the very purpose of establishing the Constitution of this 
land, this law of liberty and tolerance that we are enjoying and being 
blessed with. Having that, then, there should be further evidence to 
show that we have the gospel. I ought to be a better citizen in con- 
sequence of the religion of Jesus Christ, this perfect law of liberty, 
than I could be without this gospel. It certainly does not make me 
a worse citizen, more narrow or bigoted ; but it enlarges my soul ; 
it makes me tolerant ; it makes me helpful ; it makes me kind to my 
neighbor; it enjoins upon me all the duties of helpfulness and right- 
eousness that pertain to the gospel of Jesus Christ; so that I should 
be better as a citizen, in a civil sense. My home should look as nice 
as the home of anybody else, and as good as my circumstances will 
permit. My fence should be kept up nicely ; my surroundings should 
be clean ; my home should be clean. Cleanliness is next to godliness. 
In fact, I think you will never get any great amount of godliness 
till you first get cleanliness. So our places, our homes, our gardens, 
all that we have, should be just a little better in consequence of the 
gospel. Our taxes should be spent more carefully than any other 
people spend taxes. We should be able to invite people to settle 
among us in consequence of low taxes and good orderly government, 
in comparison with others. So I say improve your homes, brethren 
and sisters, improve your fields, improve your stock. Clean up, 
plant trees, beautify Zion, make the desert as a garden, and the wilder- 
ness to blossom as the rose. In the old scriptures the Lord said he 
"will make the wilderness like Eden, and the desert like the garden 
of the Lord. Joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving 
and the voice of melody." The voice of song and melody should 
be extended also, and all that is good and all that is great, all that 
pleases mankind we should try to do, and the knowledge of God 
will be extended. We have heard repeatedly, and we will always hear 
it, for '-it is the mission of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints to make known the story of Jesus and him crucified. Just

what he is, just what he stood for — that will always be the great 
endeavor and the great part of the mission of this Church ; after we 
are all gone, it will still be going on. 

But in all of the little things of life we should be just a little 
better, a little more kind as husband and father, a little more courteous, 
a little more polite. Do we exemplify that in our lives, in our families? 
Are husbands — these husbands that I see by the thousands before 
me — are we just as good to our wives as we could be and should be? 
You know if you are invited out to a dinner party, it is quite custo- 
mary, quite the proper thing, and a very genteel thing too, to say: 
"We have had an excellent dinner. It was very fine. I have en- 
joyed it immensely." Did you ever say that to your wife — do you, 
husbands? She has cooked for you many a good dinner. Did you 
ever say: "Wife, that is a fine dinner. That is just as good as 
anybody can cook." No; if she said: "Well, John, husband — 
how did you like your dinner?" "Why, it was all right, wasn't 
it? I didn't see anything wrong with it." It would be so unusual 
to get a word of courtesy and compliment from the husband to 
the wife. I recall a line or two of Burns on this subject: 

"Ah! gentle dames, it gars me greet, [it makes me cry] 
To think how monie counsels sweet, 
How monie lengthen'd, sage advices 
The husband frae the wife despises!" 

And it is often so. Of course, the counsel, good as it is, can be 
too lengthened. You sisters ought to remember that, too, not to make 
your advice and counsel so everlastingly long. Be tolerant and im- 
prove in that. "How many lengthened, sage advices the husband 
from the wife despises." Well now, we can be courteous with 
our children, and kind ; we can teach them politeness — these little 
civilities, these little things after all distinguish between the savage 
and the civilized. That is all they are, decent civilities, politeness, 
courtesy, a little attention. How many husbands help their wives 
as they should ? 

I stood at my window, only the other day, and watched a couple 
going down the street — a big, strong young fellow and his wife, a beauti- 
ful woman, tagging behind him. I thought, "They are married, all right." 
If he had not been, why he would have had hold of her arm. showing 
her a little attention and courtesy, and T felt like I would like to 
go out there and kick that fellow. She was good looking, too. That 
made me dislike him more. But after all. brethren and sisters, these 
kindnesses, these attentions are what make people better. Why, that 
man and woman put me in mind of the Tndian with his squaw, she 
walking behind, tagging behind. She was not carrying any load. 
If they had had a babv, she would probably have been carrying the 
baby in her arms and he would have carried the door key. That is 
the kind of courtesy that was shown. 

Now, plant trees, take care of your farms, save your means. 



ELDER CHARLES W. NIBLEY 



49 



We are living in an extravagant age. Don't you know that there 
are very few people nowadays who know how to save a dollar. We 
know how to spend it galore; but to save it, to practice self-denial 
and say, "No, I can get along without that," we cannot do it, seem- 
ingly, any more. We just have to spend and spend. Now let me 
put this into your mind, brethren and sisters, you can always spend 
your money tomorrow; don't forget that. It will be good tomorrow. 
Keep it in your pocket today and then wait until tomorrow again. 
You can always spend your money tomorrow ; practice many other 
good qualities which make for independence and well-being and which 
will deliver us from so much trouble ; that which helps to keep us 
out of debt. Get out of debt and keep out of debt. Cultivate your 
farms ; stay with your farms ; make one acre produce what two are 
now producing — it can be done as a general rule. Why not do it ; 
why not show to all the world that by our very surroundings, here 
are "Mormon" settlements, the best in the land. I remember the 
first time I went up into Canada. We rode through those endless 
miles of plains and not a tree, Presently we came in sight of some 
trees growing away up in the country there, and I said: There is 
civilization; there is a "Mormon" settlement, because it was different. 
There were settlements straggling here and there all along, but no 
trees. But when we came to the "Mormon" settlement there were 
trees, there were evidences of something more, something better than 
other people had. 

So in all of our surroundings and all that we have to do and to 
do with, we ought to practice those principles which the gospel 
teaches. And as President Grant emphasized yesterday, walk in 
obedience to the commandments. That is repeated all the way through, 
in almost every revelation given to the Prophet Joseph Smith. In 
the revelation on the Word of Wisdom we are commanded to abstain 
from this and abstain from the other ; if you do all these things 
and walk in obedience to the commandments as well, blessings are 
promised. Now walking in obedience to the commandments of the 
Lord, we ought to do all these little things, for they are command- 
ments. I am commanded by those who have presided over me to 
get out of debt, to pay up my debts when I can, and as soon as 
I can ; to keep out of debt, to practice every virtue — be honest, be 
true, be faithful, be courteous, be tolerant, be all that makes for the 
best citizenship in all the world. That is what should distinguish 
us from the world. The Savior said in his time: If you give merely 
to your sisters and your cousins and your aunts, (he did not use that 
phrase but that is undoubtedly what it amounted to) do not even 
the Publicans so? What better are you than they? 

We ought to be better, having the best government that there 
is, I mean Church government, which supplements, adds to and en- 
hances and glorifies the civil government, good as it is, . the Church 
government is still better. For as St. Paul said, "It is the perfect 



50 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



law of liberty." Having that, ought we not to show it in all our 
surroundings, in all our walks of life, in everything pertaining to us 
in our civil government with which we have to do — in treatment of 
our brethren and sisters, settling our difficulties one with another, 
in all things that make us better and more civilized, more polite, 
more generous, more big-hearted, more unselfish in all things ; to 
build up the kingdom, to glorify our God and make us different, 
a little different from most other people. If the gospel does not 
do that, then it has failed with us. I .say that it does accomplish 
these things. If you do not think there is a difference between 
the people here of this section and other peoples abroad, you just 
go and live abroad six months, anywhere outside of the confines of 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints: you will find a 
difference. There is a power of godliness here that cannot be found 
anywhere else in the world, and I testify to it. The revelation to the 
Prophet Joseph, T think it is in the 84th section of the Doctrine and 
Covenants, says this, that with this Priesthood which he has given 
to this Church, the power of Godliness is manifest, and further, with- 
out this Priesthood and the ordinances of the gospel, the power of 
godliness is not manifest to men in the flesh, anywhere, at any 
time. Now having that influence and power, we know, my brethren 
and sisters, that it will make us better and that we are a little dif- 
ferent in so many ways. It was pointed out to us yesterday that 
there is a brotherhood and a fellowship and an interest, an un- 
selfish interest in people, more than most peoples have. 

I see that my time has expired. The Lord bless you, my brethren 
and sisters, and bless this work. I testify to you, once again, that 
it is God's work. I believe most thoroughly, completely, and potently 
in the fact that the Lord Most High and his Son Jesus Christ did 
appear and teach and instruct Joseph Smith the boy prophet. I 
believe it as powerfully as if I had seen it with my own eyes ; and that 
the angel Moroni did come and instruct Joseph Smith and reveal the 
Book of Mormon, and that that book was translated by the gift 
and power of God. I believe it as potently as if that angel himself 
had talked to me. I do not see how I could believe it any more if 
I had the ocular evidence. I know it is true, I feel it in my soul. 
God bless you, b'ess this Church, bless these servants of his who 
labor all the day long for your benefit and for the benefiting of the 
Church, and for the glorifying of the name of our God in the earth, 
I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 

(Of the First Council of Seventy) 

The words of Bishop Nibley, concerning thrift and economy, 
should be hearkened unto by us all. It is our duty to live within our 
means, and to learn that happiness in life is in the spirit and no* in 



ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 



51 



worldly things. Benjamin Franklin said wisely: "It is not only im- 
portant to earn a living, but to conserve a living." How true it is that 
the eternal needs the temporal. 

The sessions of this conference have reminded me, time and time 
again, of the words of the prophet Isaiah: "And a highway shall be 
there, and a way, and it shall be called the way of holiness." And 
Ro'bert Browning said once : "I thirst for truth, but shall not drink 
until I reach the source." This was the thought that the little boy 
Joseph Smith had, when he went into the woods on a spring morn- 
ing in 1820, and asked God for light. God answered him, and the boy 
beheld his God, and at his side, the Redeemer of the world. This is 
the greatest message of history during the nineteenth century. H. G. 
Wells has shown in his Outlines of History that the world has had 
great epochs when mankind has risen to a higher life, Such epochs 
have been the rise of the Jewish race to religious power ; the birth of 
Christ, the Renaissance and Reformation, and finally the French Revo- 
lution and the rise and development of modern science. But the advent 
of God into the world when he answered the little boy Joseph Smith 
is an event that the future world will yet have to reckon with. It is 
one of the great events in history. To Joseph Smith, life was one 
supreme duty, and it was to be filled with days in which he should 
seek for truth. He knew that a "highway should be there and that it 
should be called the way of holiness," and he was not satisfied to drink 
of truth until he had reached the source. The gospel of Jesus Christ 
was given to the world at a new period of history. It was when the 
Government of the United States was in its infancy, yet it had been 
launched with the greatest political and civic ideals that were ever 
known to modern times. It was a new period of social and economic 
life, and during the period or two decades from 1830 to 1850, there 
was more advancement in industrial history than there had been in 
all the history of the world up to that time. With the coming forth of 
the gospel, new life and understanding of the ways of God came into 
the world, and we who bear the Priesthood understand those ways 
and we should live them to the best of all that is within our spiritual 
powers. You recall the gracious prayer of Paul the apostle as he 
wrote to the Ephesians : 

''For this cause I bow ray knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus 
Christ, of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named, that he 
would grant you. according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened 
with might by his Spirit in the inner man; that Christ may dwell in your 
hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able 
to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, 
and height; and to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye 
might be filled with all the fullness of God." 

Joseph Smith lived when men were doing new things and solving 
new problems in life. And I wish to say that Joseph Smith was such 
an important figure in our religious history that attention cannot be 
directed to him too often. He was the prophet of a formative, ideal-

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



istic age. "His is a voice from the heights bathed in the sunshine of 
the spirit." He spoke with his Maker, and the gospel of the Lord has 
come back to his children. And so, my brethren and sisters, in think- 
ing of the great latter-day prophet, I think of the last lesson of life, 
"the choral song which rises from all angels and is a voluntary obe- 
dience, a necessitated freedom. When man's mind is illuminated, 
when the heart is kind, he throws himself joyfully into the sublime 
order and does with knowledge, what the stones do by structure." Joseph 
Smith thirsted for truth, but did not drink until he had reached the 
source. 

The gospel of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, is to-day being 
carried to all the world. Of all people who are to be taught the divine 
message, the American Indians will, I think, accept it as quickly as 
any. The Indians of America are naturally believers in the Great 
Spirit, and their traditions and myths indicate that they know some- 
thing of the depths of religious feeling. Soon after the organization 
of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, in 1830, four 
Indians, we are told, appeared on the streets of St Louis. They were 
wan and haggard after a journey of many hundred miles from the 
wilds of the far West. They were of the Nez Perces and Flathead 
tribes and explained that they had heard of the white man's book from 
heaven and had come to find it. General George Clark, commander 
of the military post at St Louis entertained them, and they were shown 
about the city which to the Indians was the civilization of the "pale 
faces." Two of the Indians died within a few weeks, and some days 
later the other two determined to leave with a fur-ttading company 
for their homes beyond the Rocky Mountains. General Clark gave a 
dinner in their honor to which were invited a number of military officers 
and citizens. At this dinner Rabbit-Skin-Leggings and No-Horns-On- 
His-LIead, for these were the names of the two Nez Perces, were 
told about the Bible and the desire of the white men to treat all the 
native Red Men of America with equity and justice. Then one of 
the Indians arose and spoke, and according to some accounts, this is 
what he said: 

"I came to you over a trail of many moons from the setting sun. 
You were the friends of my fathers who have all gone the long- way. I 
came with one eye partly opened, for more light for my people who sit 
in darkness. I go back with both eyes closed. How can I go back 
blind to my blind people. I made my way to you with strong arms, 
through many enemies and strange lands, that I might carry much back 
to them. I go back with both arms broken and empty. The two fathers 
who came with me — the braves of many winters and wars — we leave 
asleep here by your great water. They were tired in many moons and 
their mocassins worn out. My people sent me to get the white man's 
Book from Heaven. You took me where you allow your women to dance, 
as we do not ours, and the Book was not there. You took me where they 
worship the Great Spirit with candles, as we do not ours. The Book 
was not there. You showed me images of the Great Spirit and pictures 
of the good and the Beyond, but the Book was not among them. I am 
going back the long trail and sad trail to my people of the dark land. 



ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 



53 



You make my feet heavy with burdens of gifts, and my moccasins will 
grow old in carrying them, but the Book is not among them. When I 
tell my poor people, after one more snow, in the Council, that I did 
not bring the Book, no word will be spoken by our old men, and our young 
braves. One by one they will rise and go out in silence. My people 
will die in darkness, and they will go on the long path to other hunting 
grounds. No white man will go with them and no white man's book 
to make the way plain. I have no more words." 

The two Indians went back to their homes, and soon after the 
American Board of Commissioners of Foreign Missions, of New York, 
sent Marcus Whitman, Samuel Parker, and Dr. Henry Spaulding to 
teach and convert the tribes beyond the Rocky Mountains. Both 
Whitman and Spaulding took their wives, and they were the first 
women to go to Oregon and to cross the Rocky Mountains. They 
established missions, and opened schools for the Indians, and Mrs 
Spaulding printed chapters of the Bible on an old printing press. The 
work of the missionaries did much to bring the Oregon Territory, 
later, a part of the United States. 

I hope the day will come when the gospel of Jesus Christ will be 
taken anew to the various tribes of American Indians, and I have 
confidence that they will understand the true message of the Redeemer. 
I pray God that all mankind may awaken to him who giveth eternal 
life. 

ELDER CHARLES H. HART 

(Of the First Council of Seventy) 

1 have enjoyed with you, my brethren and sisters, the testimonies 
of the brethren. The Lord has placed great weight upon two sources of 
testimony. We might call one the divine witness and the other human 
witnesses. Moroni, in the last chapter of the Book of Mormon, calls 
our attention to this great witness, the Comforter, the Holy Ghost, 
who will teach us of those things that we may not perfectly find out 
from mere human evidence. I am persuaded that the Lord has also 
placed weight upon mere human evidence, because it was foreordained 
more than twenty centuries before the three witnesses to the Book of 
Mormon were actually selected, that there would be three such wit- 
nesses ; that there should be the one witness to whom the book should 
be delivered, and there should be three special witnesses, "and in the 
mouth of as many witnesses as seemeth him good will he establish 
his word." Read II Nephi 27:12, 13 and 14, and you will get more 
fully the force of what I am trying to present. 

Of course, Joseph will always take first place among human wit- 
nesses. His testimony is very satisfactory, examine it from whatever 
point you may. He lived twenty-five years after the first divine 
manifestation to him, and his every act and word, and his whole life's 
purpose, were in accordance with the great message which he had 
received. His testimony has good carrying power, just as the apostle 



54 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Paul had good carrying power in his testimony that he had seen a 
vision, as he went on his way to Damascus to persecute the saints, and 
was miraculously converted. Indeed there is a similarity between the 
carrying force of the testimony of these two witnesses — Paul in his 
day and Joseph the Prophet in his. Inasmuch as it was an event of 
importance to have these three witnesses, their testimony has good 
carrying force, if you get my meaning from that expression. Test it in 
any way you may care to test mere human evidence, and it is satis- 
factory. 

David Whitmer, in the early 80's, was interviewed by Elder James 
H. Hart, and was asked concerning his testimony introductory of the 
Book of Mormon. This interview was placed in verse form, and after- 
ward read to and approved by David Whitmer : 

He lifted up his voice, and thus replied: 
"My written statement T have ne'er denied; 
I saw the angel, and. I heard bis voice 
And wondrous tilings that made my heart rejoice. 

"This interview was sought with earnest prayer, 
The Prophet and three witnesses were there, 
But Martin, conscience-struck, declined to stay, 
And wandered off alone, to watch and pray. 

"I do not know the angel's rank, or name, 
Who on this great and glorious mission came, 
I know that he was clothed with power and might, 
And was surrounded with effulgent light. 

"No tongue can tell the glory and the power, 
That was revealed to us in that blest hour; 
The plates of brass and gold the angel took, 
And placed before us like an open book. 

"We saw the fine engravings on them, too. 
And heard the voice declare the book is true; 
No power on earth could from our minds efface 
The glorious visions of this trysting place. 

"We've done, as then commanded we should do, 
And testified the 'Mormon Book' is true; 
And was translated by the power given 
The Prophet Joseph, by the God of Heaven. 

"Thousands of people have been here to see, 
The 'copy' Oliver has left with me; 
The characters, moreover, Martin took 
Professor Anthon — words of sacred book. 

"Some visit me who 'Mormonism' hate, 
Some ranking low, and some of high estate; 
I tell them all, as now I say to you, 
The Book of Mormon is of God, and true. 

"In yonder room I have preserved with care. 
The printer's copy, and the words so rare; 
The very words from Nephi's sacred book, 
That Martin to Professor Anthon took. 



ELDER CHARLES H. HART

"If this be not the truth, there is no truth, 
And I have been mistaken from my youth; 
If I'm mistaken, you may know from thence, 
That there's no God, no law, no life, no sense. 

"I know there is a God — I've heard his voice, 
And in his power and truth do still rejoice; 
Though fools may ridicule and laugh today, 
They yet shall know the truth of what 1 say. 

"I've suffered persecution at the hands 
Of hireling preachers and their Christian bands; 
I've braved their hatred, and have them withstood, 
While thirsting for the youthful Prophet's blood. 

"They came, four hundred strong, with visage bold, 
And said, 'Deny this story you have told, 
And by our sacred honor we'll engage 
To save you from the mob's infuriate rage.' 

"A mighty power came on me, and I spake 
In words that made the guilty mobbers quake; 
And trembling seized the surging crowd, and fear, 
But left unharmed, I felt that God was near." 

And this same witness gave this testimony as his dying statement, 
as did the other two. Martin, now buried in Clarkston, concerning 
whose resting place there is a friendly rivalry between sections of the 
country where he is buried, as to which shall have the honor in their 
cemeteries of having the ashes of this witness finally to repose — it was 
the dying statement of Martin as also of Oliver. 

David called a physician to certify that he was of sound mind 
and memory, and not under undue influence of any person, was 
rational in every way, and then gave his testimony. There is a sig- 
nificance that I would call your attention to in connection with this 
testimony, being the dying statements of these men ; because peculiar 
significance is attached to testimony that amounts to a dying declara- 
tion or a dying statement. One of the early common law jurists — 
said of such testimony given "when every hope of this world is gone, 
when every motive to falsehood is silenced, and the mind is induced 
by the most powerful considerations to speak the truth," that ''a 
situation so solemn and awful is considered by the law as creating an 
obligation equal to that imposed by an oath administered in court." 

The law as it prevails in the United States, notwithstanding the 
sixth amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which se- 
cures to the accused "the right to be confronted with the witnesses against 
him," attaches such powerful weight to a dying declaration that under 
certain circumstances hearsay testimony will be received of a dying- 
declaration. One American jurist expresses the rule as follows; 

"When dissolution is approaching and the dying man has lost all hope 
of life, and the shadows of the grave are gathering in around him and 
his mind is impressed with the full sense of his condition, the solemnity 
of the season and hour gives to his statement a sanctity of truth more 
impressive and potential than the formalities of an oath."

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



We find that Shakespeare well understood this principle, be- 
cause in his play of "King John," he makes one of his characters, one 
Mellon, who is in extremis, and who is testifying under those circum- 
stances, to disclose contemplated treachery on the part of King Louis, 
When disbelieved by those to whom he tells his story, he exclaims: 
"Have I not hideous death before my view, retaining but a quantity of 
life, which bleeds away, even as a form of wax resolveth from the 
figure against the fire? Why in the world should I deceive, since I 
must lose the use of all deceit? Why should I then be false, since it 
is true that I must die here, and live hence by truth." 

So we may gather from that, something of the force that we are justi- 
fied in attaching to the testimony of these three witnesses, who never va- 
ried in their statements, notwithstanding this one, a part of whose inter- 
view I have read, did not live long enough to come back into the full 
fellowship of the Saints ; yet he was always impressed with the sacred- 
ness of this testimony. These men whom it was determined centuries 
in advance should occupy the important position of special witnesses, 
should be indeed men of integrity and of fidelity, and of rare courage, 
s,o that they might ever stand for the truth of that which they gave. 
And Joseph, as I said, who would always be the principal human wit- 
ness to the divinity of the restoration of the Gospel and the restoration 
of the Priesthood, went consciously to his martyrdom at Carthage, 
just as anciently the Master went voluntarly and consciously to the 
great sacrifice of his life at Golgotha. 

And so we have had testimoneis reflected here of both these varie- 
ties — the testimony of the brethren of that witness which has come to 
them by the great Testator — the Comforter, the Holy Ghost, spoken 
of by Moroni as a witness to the truth of the Book, when it should 
come forth, and we have had these other testimonies of various grades. 
Indeed we can scarcely pick up a magazine or a book in the world 
without receiving testimony of some sort to the divinity of so-called 
"Mormonism." 

I thought, while President Grant, yesterday morning, referred to 
the revelations through the Prophet Joseph Smith of the obligation 
upon parenthood to take care of their children, of a recent article by 
Dr. Charles William Eliot, the president emeritus of Harvard, who 
stands as the grand old man of education, occupying the same relative 
position towards letters that our grand old man of the Church, President 
Penrose, occupies with reference to theology and religion in our Church. 
These men are the very nestors in their respective realms. Dr. Eliot, who 
just passed his ninetieth birthday — not quite so old, as you will observe, 
as our beloved President Penrose — is concerned at the way the youth of 
this land are being trained. He calls attention to three great divisions 
of life in this country, the Anglo-Catholic, the Protestant denomina- 
tions, and what he calls the "unchurched." And then he gives us a 
picture of how these "unchurched," as he calls this great division of 
our citizens, bring up their children. This article was published in last 
month's number of the Atlantic Monthly. 



ELDER CHARLES H. HART

"Their children are not baptized nor christened; if dangerous illness 
invades the family no priest or minister is requested or even allowed to 
visit the sick one; when a death occurs in a family the funeral is con- 
ducted from the undertaker's 'Funeral Parlor' or 'Funeral Home' with 
such singing and reading as the undertaker cares to provide. Marriage 
is a civil process only. The great events in human life — birth, puberty, 
mortal sickness and death — receive no religious notice with them. No 
such experiment on so vast a scale has ever been tried since time began 
as this considerable fraction of the American people are now trying — 
namely, bringing up children without any religious instruction, or any 
transmission to the rising generation of moral traditions handed down 
through primitive, barbarous and civilized peoples in succession." 

While Dr. Eliot is of a nature inclined naturally to be optimistic 
and hopeful, one can perceive his concern as to this experiment, the 
like of which has before never been performed, as he says, on so large 
a scale as this. One writer gives these lines : 

"One ship drives east and another drives west, 

While' the self-same breezes blow, 
'Tis the set of the sail, and not the gale, 

That bids them where to go. 

"The winds of the sea are like the waves of the fates, 

As. we journey along through life, — 
'Tis the set of the soul that decides the goal, 

And not the storms or the strife." 

So we are trying to use the organizations of the Priesthood, and 
all good helps in government, and the literature of the Church, to 
give the youth the right setting to the soul. 

Dr. Eliot comments, you will note, on marriage being a mere 
civil process. In reference to this question of marriage, Chas. Franklin 
Thwinge, President of a University of our land, in January, 1924, 
Current History, confesses: "I for one, as a Protestant and as one 
ordained to the Protestant ministry, should be glad to see marriage 
lifted to the rank of a sacrament, with baptism and the communion." 

Which means to us, to the rank advocated by our brethren and 
in accordance with revelations of the Church. 

My time has expired. May the Lord bless us in this work, and 
help us to have the testimony that we are entitled to, the witness of 
the Holy Ghost, in addition to all the human testimony that supports 
this great cause, is my prayer, and I ask it in the name of Jesus Chrst, 
Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN 

( Of the First Council of Seventy, and President of the 
California Mission ) 

I feel that I occupy a very important position, my brethren and 
sisters, in standing up in your presence to make a few remarks. I 
appreciate very greatly the opportunity that is afforded me of bear- 
ing witness to the truth of the great work of the Lord, as it has been 



58 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



established upon the earth in the dispensation in which we live, and of 
bringing greetings from the people in the California mission, and 
from the sons and daughters of the Latter-day Saints, in various sec- 
tions of the land, who have been appointed to labor as preachers of the 
gospel in this mission. 
• While we are in a country largely given up to pleasure more than 

to the things of God, we nevertheless come in contact with a good many 
very choice people, and the labors of the missionaries are rewarded, 
from time to time, by finding honest-hearted men and women who 
hearken to the message that has been delivered in this age ot the 
world, and are brought from the darkness that is in the world to the 
truth that has been revealed. We have a splendid company of young 
men and women operating as missionaries in the mission. They are 
very devoted to the work that has been intrusted to their care, and 
they are laboring to the best of their power to discharge their duty and 
bring their living testimony to the ears of as many people as possible. 
It has been a very great joy and satisfaction to me, my brethren and 
sisters, to be associated with these splendid men and women, one could 
almost be prompted to say, I think, "boys and girls." 

It has been a delight to note the workings of the Spirit of the 
Lord upon them, and the increase of testimony and knowledge con- 
cerning the things of God that has been brought into their souls by 
the Spirit and power of God. It is a source of very great satisfaction 
to be able to say that they are giving their time, in the preaching of the 
gospel, very cheerfully. They are not anxious to return home. It is 
a very common thing to find the missionaries in tears when announce- 
ment is made to them that they are honorably released to return home, 
and it has not been an uncommon thing to hear missionaries say that 
it is a greater trial to leave the mission field than it was to leave their 
homes and come into the mission field. And I am glad that the Lord 
thus works upon the hearts of those who are called to be his ambas- 
sadors in the preaching of the gospel, that is the power of God unto 
salvation. They come into the mission field in fear and trembling. 
They ofttimes have some question in their own minds as to whether 
the gospel that has been taught them by their parents is in very deed 
the real truth of God. and the power of God unto salvation, lint 
thank God, by giving attention to the responsibilities that have come to 
them through being called through the channels of the holy Priesthood 
to be preachers of righteousness, they make a full discovery of the 
truth that has been revealed, and their hearts are given to the Lord, 
and they labor zealously to discharge the duty that rests upon them 
as men holding divine authority. And I am glad to say, my brethren 
and sisters, that not only do these young men, who have been clothed 
with the authority of the holy Priesthood, advocate the doctrines ot 
the gospel and prosecute their ministry with very great zeal, but the 
sisters are just as anxious, they are just as willing, they are just as 
faithful, they are filled with the same spirit, and they bear witness in 



ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN 



59 



the same manner to the great truth that has been made manifest unto 
them by the power of God. 

I have thought some concerning testimonies, while listening to the 
words that have "been spoken here by the brethren. We are sometimes 
found fault with in relation to the testimonies that we bear ; men and 
women apparently entertain the thought that we ought not to be so sure 
in relation to the doctrines that we are teaching. They seem to enter- 
tain the thought that we are narrow in our views, because when we bear 
testimony to the things of God, and that we have knowledge concern- 
ing those things, it is an indication that other people do not possess 
that same knowledge. I just desire to read a word or two of scripture, 
and I thank God with all my soul that if men speak of us as being nar- 
row-minded and if they find fault with us because we bear witness 
that we have a knowledge concerning the things of God, that we do 
not bear witness in any stronger language concerning the knowledge 
that we possess and the necessity of yielding obedience to the doctrines 
of the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, than the ministers of the Re- 
deemer of the world used, when they were teaching the same gospel 
in the meridian of time. 

"This, then," wrote one of the Apostles, "is the message which we 
have heard of him, and declare unto you that God is light, and in him 
is no darkness at all. If we say that we have fellowship with him, and 
walk in darkness, we lie and do not speak the truth ; but if we walk in 
the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, 
and the blood of Jesus Christ, his Son, cleanseth us from all sins." 

I do not think any "Mormon" missionary makes testimony in any 
stronger language than that, if we say we have fellowship with him 
and walk in darkness, we lie and do not speak the truth. We teach 
men, and we feel that we are under obligation to teach men, that they 
must walk in the light as the Lord Jesus Christ is in the light, and that 
we can only have fellowship with our Redeemer, and with the truth 
of God, as we thus walk in the light. 

And the same writer, in similar language, teaches the same kind of 
doctrine : "Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine 
of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, 
he hath both the Lather and the Son." 

And then this writer says with unbounded certainty: "If there 
come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into 
your house, neither bid him God speed : Lor he that biddeth him God 
speed is partaker of his evil deeds." 

And the same writer again makes declaration : "And we know 
that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness." 

I do not understand that I have been sent to labor in the California 
mission with any instruction, in any way, to compromise the word of 
God and the doctrines of the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, but that 
I have been sent there to teach men that they must walk in the light 
as the Lord Jesus Christ is in the light, that they must turn from the 



60 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



doctrines of men, and the follies of men, and the theological nonsense 
that there is in the world today, and yield obedience to the truth that 
has been revealed by the Lord God of heaven. I would that I might 
make that clear to the understanding of those who are within our 
gates today. We have a message to deliver to the inhabitants of the 
earth, a message that has been revealed by the Lord our God, that has 
been sent to this world by the coming of the Father and the Son, as 
has heen taught in our conference — divine authority restored to mortal 
men, by the sending of holy angels who, placing their hands upon the 
heads of mortal men, conferred upon them the authority of the holy- 
Priesthood, and made them representatives of the Lord Jesus Christ, 
giving them power and authority to call men to repentance, and to 
administer legally the saving ordinances of the gospel. And this is 
in keeping with the revelations of God and the promises of God, made 
by the very apostles whose words I have read in your hearing — that 
there was to come a time when another angel should wend his way 
from heaven, "having the everlasting gospel, to preach to the inhab- 
itants of the earth, to every nation, and to every kindred, and to every 
tongue and to every people, crying with a loud voice, Fear God and 
give glory to him, for the hour of his judgment is come." 

It is my responsibility to bear witness that that angel has wended 
his way from heaven to earth, that divine authority, the power to speak 
in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, has been given again to men, 
and by that authority we call men to repentance and to the waters of 
baptism, that they may be cleansed from their sins, and that they may- 
walk in the light, as he is in the light, and there is no other way, and 
there is no other authority upon the face of the whole earth that can 
thus minister the ordinances of the gospel which are essential to the 
salvation of the human family. 

God help us to believe the truth, and stand for the truth, and teach 
the truth, let men say or think what they may, I humbly pray, in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER RULON S. WELLS 

(Of the First Council of Seventy) 

I rejoice this day in the testimony of the truth that has been re- 
vealed from heaven through the instrumentality of the Prophet Joseph 
Smith ; in the truth of that gospel which has been restored to the 
earth, which I bear witness is the power of God unto salvation. The 
fool hath said in his heart, "there is no God." There are many who 
are willing to believe that there is some vague essence existing in the 
universe which they are pleased to call God, but at any near approach 
of that divine being, by whose power the earth and the heavens have 
been created, they begin to deny him. The poet has told us that "dis- 
tance lends enchantment to the view," and ,so I think it is with reference 
to the faith of many men and women upon the face of the earth. — 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS 



61 



The farther away and more remote they can locate their Supreme 
Being, the better satisfied they are ; but when he reveals himself to man 
in the day and age in which we live, then they begin to deny him. 
When God manifested himself in the flesh in the coming of our Lord 
and Savior, Jesus Christ, God was made manifest. He came near 
unto men and only those who had in their hearts a love of God were 
willing to accept of him as in very deed the Son of God, the creator 
of heaven and earth. Mankind are in darkness to a very great extent 
in their search after God. 

I rejoice in the efforts that are made by honest investigators en- 
deavoring to find out something of the secrets of life. I have no desire 
whatever to criticize all such honest investigation. May the truth 
dawn upon their minds, and may the inspiration of the Almighty assist 
them in their honest endeavor to find out the truths of heaven. But if 
they desire to know the truth, they can only learn it by securing 
the Spirit of God that comes from his presence and reveals these .secrets 
unto the children of men. But if we possess his holy Spirit, then may 
we attain to this divine knowledge, and not otherwise. 

My heart goes out in love and admiration and in adoration unto 
my heavenly Father, when I look out upon this beautiful world, and 
particularly at this season of the year when we see the buds swelling 
upon the trees, about to burst into a new life, when we see the grass 
coming out of the ground, vegetation making itself manifest, and when 
a few days hence all nature will be alive, quickened by the power of 
God. And my heart goes out in worship and adoration to the giver of 
this life, the creator of all things. I am inclined to refer to a couple 
of paragraphs which I committed to memory when I was a boy. They 
seem to carry the expression of thought that is now in my heart. The 
paragraphs referred to were written in the German language, and I 
committed them to memory while I was engaged in the study of that 
language. I will endeavor to give a free translation of them : 

"Things that are useful, benevolent and indispensable ; things which 
pertain to our clothing, to our nourishment and to our shelter, and 
generally speaking that pertain to the sustaining of living creatures, 
we find in nature. Water quenches our thirst. All kinds of fruits 
satisfy our hunger. We find materials for the building of our homes, 
and for the clothing of our bodies. An Almighty hand distributes 
among us the things that we need ; but also things that are beautiful, 
grand and glorious hath God created ; things which we view with 
wondering ecstasy, things that arouse our admiration and fill our hearts 
with joy — the splendor of the starry heavens, the morning and the 
evening red, the different forms and colors of the clouds, the beauti- 
ful green of the meadows, the blossoms and the flowers show us a 
beauty and a splendor which touch our hearts and lift up our souls in 
grateful adoration to God that he hath so beautifully and so inimitably 
adorned his great creation work." 

These are the thoughts that come into my heart when I look out 
upon this wonderful world in which we live, and I feel to worship 



62 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



and adore my heavenly Father as the Creator of all things that are, 
in this world in which we live today. How I marvel at the infidelity, 
at the atheism, the agnosticism, that prevail among mankind, when they 
stand in the midst of these wonderful things that ought to fill their 
hearts with faith in God, and to turn them to him, to worship him in 
spirit and in truth. 

When I look out upon this vast congregation before me now 
and realize that here are many thousands of living human beings whose 
faces are directed towards me, and who hearken to the words which 
I now speak, my heart is filled with wonder to think what miracle 
stands before me when so many can be attracted, and possibly interested, 
in the words that I now speak. Oh, how I feel that God has mani- 
fested himself in his very children that dwell upon the face of the 
earth, living - , intelligent beings, having the power to understand and to 
think and to receive knowledge and understanding or instruction. 

Men have endeavored to find out the origin of life. May they 
succeed in their honest endeavors to do so. Men have tried to prove 
that human beings have descended from lower orders of life. There 
has never been any satisfactory discovery to indicate that the human 
family have ever been anything else than human beings, the children 
of God, but, on the contrary they have always found that all life 
proceeds from some similar anterior life. With all due respect to what 
they have observed in the law of differentiation or of natural selec- 
tion, they have never been able to satisfactorily show any change of 
species. Men have been formed and fashioned in the image of their 
great Creator. But even in the investigations which learned men have 
made, when they go back to the protoplasm, or the small cells to which 
they sometimes refer, even then the mystery of life is just as great 
as it was in the beginning. This world is teeming with this wonderful 
phenomenon of life. It is everywhere abundant. It manifests itself 
in the vegetation, in the grass, the trees and the flowers, in the 
animals that creep upon the earth, in the fowls of heaven, the fishes of 
the seas, and the beasts of the field as they are found upon the earth, 
and also in mankind. Mr. H. G. Wells in his "Outline of History" 
points out that this thing that we call life, this phenomenon, is within 
certain restricted areas to be found upon the earth, a few hundred 
feet beneath the surface, a few thousand feet into the air, and out 
into the streams of water and in the mighty ocean, but beyond these 
limitations there is no such thing as life, at least so far as the 
scientific world has any knowledge whatever; but within those 
limitations the world is teeming with life. Whence came it? We 
read and understand, and the philosophers and scientists tell us — and 
truly, too, I think — that there was a time when this earth upon which 
we live was a molten fiery mass, where the heat was so intense that 
no living thing could exist upon it. Then whence came all this life 
now manifest among us? Did it come by spontaneous generation? 
Did it create itself? Impossible! This same author points out that 
there are certain characteristics of life, one of them being that things 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS

that live have some motion of their own accord. It may be merely the 
movement of the roots of a blade of grass, but there is some self 
motion. Another characteristic is that all things that live must be 
nourished, receive nourishment or they will die, another is that living 
things will grow. Another characteristic is that having attained their 
maturity they propagate and reproduce their own kind, not any other 
kind. And still another characteristic of things that live is that they 
will die; all things that live must die. These are the characteristics 
of living things, different from the* things that have no 1 life, like the 
rocks, the metals, the gold, the silver, the copper, the lead, and the 
tin that have no life. Well, whence came this life that we see in 
abundance, this whole world teeming with it everywhere? Inasmuch 
at at one time, it could not have existed upon the earth ; and go back 
as far as they wid scientists do not explain the origin of life, but 
they freely admit : we do not know the origin of life, then let us go 
to the good book and there we shall find the only rational explanation 
of it: 

"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth," and all 
things that in them are. 

And he "created man in his own image, in the image of God 
created he him; male and female created he them." 

There is the testimony of Moses, the Prophet of God, bearing 
witness to the fact that God is our Creator. 

Again in the days when the Savior came and administered in this 
world among men, Peter declared to him when he was asked, "Whom 
say ye that 1 am?" "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God." 

That was his testimony. He knew that he was the Christ, the Son 
of the living God. The Savior told him : "Flesh and blood hath 
not revealed this unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven." But 
some people tell us that Jesus never claimed that he was the Son of 
God, that he never said it, and yet he declares here that Peter had 
received this knowledge from the revelation of God the Father to him. 
And again when Lazarus, the brother of Martha and Mary died, Jesus 
was away, but he came up and he was met by Martha who came out 
to meet him and said: "Lord, if thou hadst been here, he had not 
died." And the Savior replied : "He shall live again." Martha said : 
"Yea, Lord, we know in that last day in the resurrection from the 
dead." And the Savior made this notable remark: "I am the resur- 
rection and the life, and he that believeth on me, though he were 
dead, yet shall he live." And then he declared: "He that believeth 
on me .shall never die. Believest thou this?" said he to Martha, and 
she replied, bearing her .splendid testimony: "Yea, Lord, I believe 
that thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God." Joseph Smith 
received a revelation contained in Section 88 of the Book of Doctrine 
and Covenants, and after setting forth the fact that the spirit and the 
body constitute the soul of man, this revelation reads : "And the 
resurrection of the body is the redemption of the ,soul." Then the next 
paragraph explains how the redemption of the soul is brought about,

who brings it to pass. "And," declares the Lord to Joseph Smith, in 
entirely different words, but telling the same story: "And the re- 
demption of the soul," or the resurrection of the body, "is through 
him who quickeneth all things." He quickeneth the grass and makes 
it grow. He causes the buds to swell and burst with 
new life, and causes the animal creation to live upon the 
earth. He gives unto us the breath of life. He quickeneth 
all things, the Savior of the world. Hence he is called the 
Redeemer of mankind. So here we find Moses, the Savior of the 
world, Peter, Martha, and Joseph Smith the prophet, giving utterance 
to the same thing, truly in different language, under different cir- 
cumstances, but all bearing record to the self same truth that Jesus is 
the Christ, the Son of the living God, the Redeemer of the world, 
the very Son of God. That is the testimony of the Latter-day Saints, 
and I bear witness to the testimony that now burns in my heart that 
this is the truth, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang, "Praise God from whom all 
blessings flow." 

The closing prayer was offered by Elder Wm. H. Richards, presi- 
dent of the Malad stake of Zion. 

Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock p. m. 

AFTERNOON SESSION 

At 2 o'clock p. m., April 5>, 1924, President Heber J. Grant pre- 
sided and announced that the choir and congregation would sing, "O 
ye mountains high." 

Following the hymn, Elder Hugh J. Camion, president of the Lib- 
erty stake of Zion, offered the opening prayer. 

A duet entitled, "Love Divine" was sung by Ross Pratt and Melba 
Connelly. 

The tabernacle was crowded to overflowing and an arrangement 
had been made to accommodate by radio an overflow congregation at 
the Assembly Hall, which was also largely attended. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

It is certainly very gratifying to see this building filled to over- 
flowing with people, many standing in the aisles and the doorways. We 
have never before had such an attendance upon a week day at any of our 
conferences as we had yesterday and as we are having today. Ampli- 
fiers have been installed in the Assembly Hall, so that those who 
do not have seats here, and would like to go over there, can be com- 
fortably seated, and hear whatever is .said in this building. 



ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE 65 

ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE 

Once upon a time I had occasion to make purchases for the 
fitting up of rooms for office work. 

NOT CONNECTED UP A COMPARISON 

I went into a large electrical establishment, there to select electro- 
liers, push buttons, switches, bells, and annunciators. I was confronted 
with a splendid display of these appliances. The salesman, up-to- 
date in matter and method, drew my attention to the excellence of 
this or that piece, and showed me how well the push button provided 
for the wall would go with that particular hanging, or the bell that 
he recommended. I stepped to the button and pressed it, but, lo, there 
was silence. I turned a switch to see how the light would glow in 
the frosted globe, to which my attention had been drawn with many 
commendatory remarks from the salesman, but there was no light. 
I knew the reason, but I gave myself the pleasure, of having him 
explain. He said : "You see these things are here for show, they 
are not connected up." After having made my selections I smiled 
over the incident as it came to me in mind, and I said : "How like 
some of the institutions of men — beautiful to look upon, gilded, studded, 
ornamental, sometimes simple and ofttimes lavish and ornate, but not 
connected up." 

INSTITUTIONS OF MEN 

Men may form institutions as they like, provided they have 
but good purpose in so doing, and may do with those institutions, 
within the limits of propriety, whatever they choose, and they may 
even call such institutions churches — for there is no patent on the 
term — and these being churches that men have made, they may be 
handled as men choose. So I have no fault to find at all with men 
or institutions who are suggesting changes in their creeds, or mod- 
ifications of what have been regarded as their fundamental doctrines. 
They made those churches, and they can do with them just as they 
like. They have named them appropriately ; most of the names are 
expressive, honest, frank and truthful ; and men may do what they 
like within the limits of reason and ordinary propriety with things 
that men have made. 

BEWARE OF FORMS WITHOUT POWER 

Someone has remarked that there is a difference between the 
form and the substance. I only need to remind you of the admonition 
that Paul gave unto his associate in the ministry, Timothy, to be in 
turn given by the younger missionary to the people : to beware of 
the form of godliness without the power thereof. Read it for your- 
selves in II Timothy, third chapter. There is a context there to 
which I would like to call your attention, for I believe it has ap- 
plication in this day: ■ j . ; , , 



66 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



"This know also," wrote Paul, "that in the last days perilous times 
shall come. 

"For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, 
blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful unholy, 

"Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, 
fierce, despisers of those who are good, 

"Traitors heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers 
of God." 

Do you not think that Paul was a prophet? Was he not a 
seer in fact? Was he not able to see this day, these last times? He 
sums up his admonition in the next verse: 

"Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from 
such turn away." 

THE GOSPEL GIVEN BY REVELATION OF JESUS CHRIST 

We read that in the wonderful manifestation of the Father and 
his Son, Jesus Christ, to Joseph Smith in this last age, in the spring 
of 1820, the Lord Jesus Christ made that same comment, or de- 
claration, concerning the many opposing, quarreling, contending sects 
of the times, whose creeds he pronounced an abomination in his sight ; 
for, said he, "they draw near to me with their lips, but their hearts 
are far from me; they teach for doctrines the commandments of men, 
having a form of godliness, but they deny the power thereof." With 
marked appropriateness Bishop Nibley this morning drew attention to 
a passage in the 84th Section of the Doctrine and Covenants. Such 
part of it as he cited, he quoted exactly. The context, however, is 
interesting to consider, beginning with the 19th verse, the Lord having 
spoken of the real meaning and significance of the Priesthood, which 
is the power to speak and to act in the name of God, declared; 

"And this greater priesthood administereth the gospel and holdeth the 
key of the mysteries of the kingdom, even the key of the knowledge of God. 

"Therefore, in the ordinances thereof, the power of godliness is manifest. 

"And without the ordinances thereof, and the authority of the priest- 
hood, the power of godliness is not manifest unto men in the flesh." 

Now, as I have started on Scripture reading, and I can not give 
you better doctrine than that we find recorded in the written word, 
I turn for a moment to the letter that Paul wrote to the saints in 
Galatia, some of whom had become careless and negligent after his 
departure, so that he had to remind them of their duties. He said : 

"I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into 
the grace of Christ unto another gospel:" 

Then he went on to explain : 

"Which is not another: but there be some that trouble you, and would 
pervert the gospel of Christ. 

"But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto 
you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. 

"As we said before, so say I now again. If any man preach any other 



ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE 



67 



gospel unto you than that ye have received let him be accursed. 

"For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for 
if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ." 

But I ask you, note particularly the verses following, justifying 
what may otherwise appear to be severe, if not caustic, words : 

"But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me 
is not after man. 

"For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the 
revelation of Jesus Christ." 

PREACHING FOR DOCTRINE THE COMMANDMENTS OF MEN 

We proclaim our adherence to the principle of toleration. "We 
claim the privilege of worshiping Almighty God according to the 
dictates of our own conscience, and allow all men the same privilege, 
let them worship how, where, or what they may." Some have fancied 
that there is a little inconsistency between what we have called the 
liberty of the gospel and such admonitions as that of Paul, which 
I have read unto you ; but there is no inconsistency. Who were to 
be accursed? Those who preached any other gospel than that which 
he had preached unto them, for the gospel he had preached unto them 
was not of men; it had been given by revelation; and he preached 
it, as he had a right to do, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. 
Now he was referring to those who were on the inside, people who 
were going about amongst the Saints, many of whom, perhaps all of 
whom, claimed some standing with them, preaching a false doctrine 
and setting up a false gospel, and upon them he pronounced the 
anathema of cursing for presenting their own conceptions and their 
own views as the revealed word of God. Were such not deserving 
of a curse? Was it not deception of the most serious kind — preach- 
ing as the doctrines of Christ what was nothing more than the theories, 
the precepts and the commandments of men? 

THE SIN OF PREACHING WITHOUT AUTHORITY 

If you wish to preach these things as the precepts of men, all 
well and good. Let those who will, listen to them; but to preach 
such and affirm that they are the doctrines of Jesus Christ, unless 
they are in harmony with the doctrines of Jesus Christ, is blasphemy. 
This Church stands for the gospel that Paul preached. It is the 
gospel of all times, the gospel of Jesus Christ, and it has been preached 
in the world since the days of Adam, though there have been long 
periods of darkness, due to repeated apostasies, when the people have 
turned away, loving Satan more than they loved God, and making it 
impossible for the gospel to be widely proclaimed. But it has been 
given to the earth, again and again, through the different dispensations, 
which have been special conferments and bestowals of authority by the 
Lord for the carrying out of His purposes. 

Do you not remember that the risen Lord, in giving his last 



68 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



instructions to the apostles, told them to go into all the world and 
teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of 
the Son and of the Holy Ghost? Who dares take unto himself 
authority to officiate in those names, the names of the Holy Trinity, 
• if he has not been duly commissioned? Who would dare undertake 
to speak in the name of the Governor of this sovereign State if he 
were not duly commissioned? The prison bars are ready to open to 
receive such a one. It would be a crime under the law of the State. 
Who can speak in behalf of an officer of the law, if he has not been 
properly deputized, if authority has not been delegated unto him? Now, 
why shall we use one rule of common sense in dealing with the things 
of earth and a rule that is not in accordance with common sense in 
dealing with the authorities and powers of heaven? 

THE AUTHORITY OF ANCIENT TIMES NOT SUFFICIENT FOR TODAY 

When the Lord established his Church amongst the Xephites 
upon this continent, he told those who were chosen and ordained, 
unto whom authority was given, just how to administer the ordin- 
ance of baptism. They were to say : "Having authority given me 
of Jesus Christ, I baptize you in the name of the Father and of the 
Son, and of the Holy Ghost." That does not give us in this age any 
such authority. The words that Christ spoke unto his apostles of 
old would be no authority unto the apostles today, nor unto any of 
the elders of the Church. I repeat, -the words that he, the Lord, 
spoke unto the disciples who were chosen from among the Nephites 
would be no authority unto us; but in this day and age he has spoken 
again, and has given that .same power and authority to speak in his 
name, and to administer the ordinances of the gospel, after the pattern 
that he has set ; and therefore the elders and priests who take candidates, 
who have professed their faith, and who have repented of their sins, 
into the waters of baptism today, declare that they have authority 
given them : and, being commissioned of Jesus Christ, they baptize in 
the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost. Many 
have assumed that men may administer these ordinances of their 
own accord, though such assumption is opposed to all reason. In 
the early days of this Church, when many were trying to get in, some 
wanted admission because they had been baptized in other churches ; 
they had received the ordinance called baptism ; and the Lord .spoke 
definitely upon the matter. Read the 22nd section of the Doctrine and 
Covenants, wherein he said unto the people in that day: 

"Behold, I say unto you that all old covenants have I caused to be done 
away in this thing; and this is a new and an .everlasting covenant, even that 
which was from the beginning. 

"Wherefore, although a man should be baptized an hundred times 
it availeth him nothing, for you cannot enter in at the strait gate by the 
law of Moses, neither by your dead works. 

"For it is because of your dead works that I have caused this last 
covenant and this church to be built up unto me, even as in days of old."

THE CHURCH OF CHRIST HAS AUTHORITY AND IS CONNECTED UP 

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the Church 
its name declares it to be, and the authority and power of the holy 
Priesthood is in it, without which there could not be, cannot be, shall 
never be, a Church of Jesus Christ true to the name. I thank the Lord 
that we have learned that truth, and that we belong to a Church that 
is connected up. Amen. 

ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL 

( Of the First Council of Seventy) 

Every man or woman who is called to a position of this kind 
has a great desire to be guided and influenced by the Holy Spirit. I 
have had a great deal of experience during my life in a public way, 
but never at any time did I feel more uncertain and doubtful as to 
my success in speaking to the people than I do at the present time. 
I have all kinds of experiences in talking to people. When I thought 
I had the Spirit of the Lord, some of the people did not think so. 
So that you can never tell ; and if you say there is such a man living upon 
the earth, however inspired he may be, or however good a man he may 
be, who can please and satisfy all people, I question whether that man 
ever lived. I know mighty well I am not one of them. 

Now my brethern and sisters, there is not a man in this vast 
congregation more happy to be with you than I am today. I am a 
native of Utah, I was born here, I have lived here, and I have never 
crossed the waters. I have heard from time to time, since our last 
conference, some who were non-"Mormons," some who were non- 
residents of Utah, and some of our own rising generation, speak very 
lightly about what President Brigham Young said when he entered 
this valley, "This is the place." Well, I am here to say it is the place, 
and I just came from California, too. 

This vast congregation, as I understand it, consists of represen- 
tatives of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. There may be 
representatives, and are, from every stake of Zion, and you have come up 
here to be awakened, to be aroused — not that you are told anything 
special that you do not already know. I cannot think of a thing that 
I ever heard that will be new to you ; but if you can be awakened 
and return to your people and arouse them, then this has been a 
great conference. I had that feeling while I was away. I have not 
had as much physical force as I desire. I am a little low on vitality. 
I run out of gasoline every little while. 

Now, the brethren of the authorities have been very kind to me ; 
they have been very considerate, and I am very appreciative. I have 
a letter that I value more than gold and silver, signed by the Presi- 
dency of this Church, and they closed their letter to me saying: "You 
have our love, our confidence and our blessing." 1 do not know 
whether I am appreciative, I think I am. The Presidency never will 



70 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



know how much good that did me. Not that I was in doubt, not 
that I was in uncertainty about the matter, but I love my people, 
I always say, God save the people, for if it were not for people, we 
would not need this great Church. I do not know what God would 
do if he had no people. I have said it before, and I say it again. 
I was with an apostle on a trip in the south, and we found a bishop 
without any people. He wept, and came to the apostle to know what 
to do. "Well you will have to stay here until some people come to 
you." All the people he had was his wife, and anybody that can 
preside over his wife, I take my hat off to him. So I feel like that 
good woman in ancient days who said : 

"Whither thou goest, I will go ; and where thou lodgest, I will 
lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God." Why, 
bless your hearts, I haven't a doubt in my mind — I have doubts about 
myself and about others — about this work. I have found God, God 
answered my prayers, and God softened the hearts of the people, and 
they fed me and they gave me a place to lay my head. It seems to 
me when I read the scriptures, that the apostles of old, whom the 
Savior chose, were stupid ; they did not seem to understand nor com- 
prehend what the Savior was trying to teach, just as some of our 
people are. They, the people, seem to be stupid, they seem not to 
understand. Finally these apostles were taken out, after the Savior had 
completed his labors, and he lifted up his hands and blessed them, 
and he told them: "Nevertheless I tell you the truth; Tt is expedient 
for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will 
not come unto you ; but if I depart, I will send him unto you." And 
he spoke to them again, — "Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is 
come, he will guide you into all truth : * * * * and he will show 
you things to come." 

That is the same Spirit, the same guiding Spirit that our elders 
have : these young "kid-boys" that you are sending out all over the 
world. They are blessed and set apart, and that Spirit is with them. 
I remember when I was presiding over the Southern States mission : 
for two years of that time I brought home two emigrations a year, and 
when I went to the President's office to report, that great Prophet, 
the President of the Church, Wilford Woodruff, who was interested in 
me, said : "Brother Kimball, sit down a minute." We only had a 
few minutes — it didn't take five minutes. He told me more than once: 
"Now, Brother Kimball, I have had visions, I have had revelations, 
I have seen angels, but the greatest of all is that still small voice." 
Any elder who has gone out and kept the commandments of God, 
knows he has heard that word behind him saying: "This is the way, 
walk ye in it, when you turn to the right and when you turn to the 
left." 

My brethren and sisters, I am not disposed to occupy any more 
of your time. I love God's people, I am willing to live and die with 
God's people. Come weal or woe, come life or death. I have a prayer 



ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL 



71 



that I offer sometimes when I walk by the wayside, and I say : "I now 
place myself and all my affairs" — I haven't got any affairs however — 
"in the kind care and keeping of the Father, with a loving trust, 
knowing that all things are working for my best good." I am willing 
to follow God's leading, even though it may sometimes seem hard- 
to do so. I am blessed in all of my labors because the Father gives 
to me of his Spirit to guide and direct me in every situation. Like 
you, I have committed many blunders ; like thousands of people, tragedy 
comes to our homes without any fault of ours; but we love our chil- 
dren, and I am now learning to pray : "O God the eternal Father, I thank 
thee that the children thou gavest me are thy children." 

God bless you. I know this work is true, and I know, if I know 
anything, that all the keys and the powers and the authority that were 
vested in the Prophet Joseph Smith from God the eternal Father and 
his messengers, were conferred upon Brigham Young, upon my father 
and other apostles, upon the present president of the Church and the 
apostles. So all we need to do, brethren and sisters, is to work for 
salvation — the greatest gift of God to the children of men, and as my 
father said : "If you are saved, no one will be more surprised than 
you are." Now the Lord bless you, in the name and through the 
power of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH QUINNEY, Jr. 

(President of the Canada Mission) 

My dear brethren and sisters, if there ever was a time in my life 
that I desired to be guided and directed by the light and power of God, 
the Eternal Father, it is the present. This is the largest congregation 
of people that I have ever stood in the presence of, and I assure you 
that I feel my weakness. Still, at the same time, with your faith and 
prayers I desire to leave with you my humble testimony concerning 
the divinity of this great and mighty work that has come to us in this 
day and time. 

There is a saying of the Prophet Joseph Smith that the things of 
God are of deep import, and only by careful and ponderous considera- 
tion and experience can we find them out. "Thou must commune with 
God." If ever a truth has come into my life, it has been this truth, 
during the last year or more since I have been engaged in missionary 
work in the world. I know that in order to be successful in the deliv- 
ering of this great and mighty message, one must commune with God. 
One must come very near to him, must feel his power and his influ- 
ence in unfolding this message of truth to the hearts of the children 
of men in the world ; and, if I am any judge of conditions as they come 
under our supervision in the mission field, I am convinced that in order 
to convert mankind to this great message of truth, one must be en- 
dowed with the Spirit of God, which comes through humble and sin- 
cere prayer or communion with God.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



You know when Christ had had some dealings with the Pharisees 
and Sadducees, and he had asked his disciples concerning- what men 
thought of him ; some of them told him that the people around about 
thought he was John the Baptist, or Elias, or Jeremias or one of the 
Prophets. He turned to them and said : "But whom say ye that I 
am?" And you will recall that Peter answered the question by say- 
ing: "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God." Observe how 
positive and direct this question is. I believe that in the question which 
Christ put to his disciples, is contained a power that brings home a 
relationship between us and God, our eternal Father, so much so that 
if the question were put to us in the same way as it was put to Peter, 
and the apostles, it would need the same quality of inspiration that 
Peter had when he told the Savior that he was the Christ, the Son 
of the living God, in order for us to know also that he is the Savior 
of mankind. 

You will recall that in addition to this question, Christ said to 
Peter: "Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona, for flesh and blood have 
not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven. Upon 
this rock will I build my Church and the gates of hell shall not prevail 
against it." I desire to call your attention to the power there is in 
this statement of the Christ. So positive is it, that he told Peter that 
there was no question as to the origin of Peter's information regarding 
this definite truth concerning him. I feel, this afternoon, that not only 
we, who comprise the Church, are built upon this rock of revelation, 
but in order to know within our own selves the divinity of this work 
individually, we must be guided and prompted by that spirit of revela- 
tion that Peter enjoyed when he gave answer to the question put to 
him by the Christ. I know by experience that in order to have burn- 
ing in our hearts a testimony of the Living God, we must build upon 
this principle of revelation which comes to us through our communion 
with God. 

I bear my testimony to you, this afternoon, that I know, as I 
know that I breathe the breath of life, that God lives, and that Jesus 
Christ is the Only Begotten Son of Cod in the flesh. I know as I know 
that I live that Joseph Smith is a prophet of the living God, and that 
through him has come to us this great and mighty work, this great 
scheme of life and salvation. T have found in the unfolding of this 
scheme of life to the nations of the earth that when I have been humble 
and prayerful, and have appreciated what it means to get close to 
God, the words which I have uttered have sunk into the hearts 
of men and women until they have become converted to this truth. 

I know, my brethren and sisters, that the power of revelation is 
in this Church. I know that President Grant is a Prophet of God. It 
has been made known to me, and I do pray God. my eternal Father, 
that he will bless us with inspiration, that we will unite ourselves to- 
gether and pray as we have never prayed before, in our lives, that this 
work will be perpetuated ; and when that time comes that we shall be

called to meet our God, it will be said of us : "Well done, thou good 
and faithful servant, enter into the joy of thy Lord." 

God bless the testimonies that have been given at this conference 
for our good and for the glory of God is my prayer, in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JOHN H. TAYLOR 

(President of the Northern States Mission) 

I presume that the time will never come when all of the people 
of this country or any other country will always speak good of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Such was the experience 
of Christ in the early days when he established his Church upon the 
earth. Such was the experience of his apostles, the experience of 
Joseph Smith and the experience of his people, as they have tried to live 
lives of usefulness and righteousness upon the earth. It is, however, 
gratifying as I travel among the people, to find that there is a spirit 
of kindliness towards the Church, a spirit that is being generated 
among the men of the country, especially among the business men, 
of tolerance and of good will towards the members of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I am always glad when people 
are willing to listen to our explanation of the gospel, and pleased 
when they speak well of this great Western community of which we 
are a part. I delight in hearing the favorable expressions that are 
made in regard to our people. 

I notice on our streets and in our stores, signs which say: "Boost 
for Utah." We could say the same thing about Idaho, Wyoming, 
Arizona or Canada. I am glad that we are desirous of boosting for 
this great western country of ours, because it is a good country and 
contains a splendid class of men and women. 

Our missionaries are out in the world ; and I know of no greater 
boosters. It is true that they are out preaching the gospel of Jesus 
Christ, but while they are doing it, they cannot forget their mountain 
home, they cannot forget the hills and the plains and the streams 
of running water ; they cannot forget how God has blessed this coun- 
try of ours, and they are always telling the people of the glories of the 
same; In no instance do they express "if's" or "but's" about any of 
the people of this country of ours. They forget some of our so-called 
"friends" and the things they say about us, and about our leaders, 
remembering the splendid men and women not of our faith who live 
in this great country of ours. That is what I like. I delight seeing 
men and women boost for their people as well as for their lands, 
their herds, their hills and their wealth. I hope that the "Mormon" 
people will always speak well of their country and of the people in 
the places in which they live. 

I hope the world will permit us to direct our own Church as 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



other people are permitted to direct their churches. I hope they will 
let us interpret the doctrines of our faith in the way we want 
to interpret them, the same privilege being given to others. If 
they will do this we can unite with them, and they with us, and we 
will go on and make this country one of the most splendid places to 
live in on the face of the earth. 

These men whom we meet from time t> time speak well of the 
Church because of the manner in which it has built up the country. 
They point to our meeting houses, they point to our public places, 
they say : "You believe in your Church because you are going' to stay, 
and you build well. You believe in your country as a great place 
to live in and you take part in the civic life of your communities." 
They say, "We like the kindliness and the courtesy that is extended 
to us through the Bureau of Information." This Bureau is one of 
the most wonderful institutions we have of boosting for the coun- 
try and the people and the things we have. As we go from place to 
place we are told of the kind treatment and courtesy shown to the 
people when they visited here. They admire the way we take care of 
our young people in their recreational and their spiritual life; they 
admire the way we bring them together and teach them the word 
of God, setting them examples which they can follow, thereby be- 
coming not only good members of the Church, but clean, fine, patriotic 
American citizens, who love their country and are willing to stand 
by it in every emergency. These young people of ours are a splendid 
people, and they come out into the world, and by the spirit and power 
of the gospel of Jesus Christ, they bear testimony to the world; and 
kindle a desire in people to know something more about this great 
"Mormon" people living in this Rocky Mountain district. Above all, 
they impress their hearers with our sincerity. As has been said of 
Christ, he spoke as one having authority, so say they of the boys and 
the girls and the men and the women who go out into the world 
and visit among them — that they speak as men and women having 
authority to speak for God upon the earth. 

May this good spirit stay with us, may we live lives of usefulness 
and righteousness upon the earth, and then God's work shall grow 
and we shall become a greater people and a better people. May God 
help us to do this and to serve him all the days of our lives, I humbly 
ask, in the name of Jesus Christ, our Redeemer, Amen. 

ELDER BRIGHAM S. YOUNG 

(President of the Northwestern States Mission) 

My dear brethren and sisters, I desire while I speak that I may 
have a portion of the spirit that has thus far characterized this con- 
ference ; namely, the spirit of instruction. 

I have the honor to preside over the Northwestern States mission 



ELDER BRIG HAM S. YOUNG 



75 



and it is indeed an honor and an opportunity. I have the honor to 
have the association of young men and women who have been sent 
out into the world to proclaim the truth, and they are proclaiming it. 
They are learning its value and power. I was very much impressed by 
a statement in the prayer of Brother John W. Hart. He said in the 
course of his petition: "Magnify, O God, the missionaries in the 
eyes of the world." They are being magnified, brethren and sisters, 
God hears these young men and women. He knows the purity of 
their lives, and you find it expressed in the teachings of the 
Gospel as they give them to the various congregations and people with 
whom they come in contact. 

We have, in the Northwestern States mission, a mission among the 
Indians, established by President Melvin J. Ballard, when he presided 
over the Northwestern States mission. I have the pleasure and priv- 
ilege of visiting that little mission every three months. We conduct 
there an Indian school, and the school superintendent of the reservation 
told me a few days ago that we had one of the best schools on the 
reservation. We know that in some of those schools conducted by 
other churches it is necessary for them to turn the key on their pupils 
in order that they shall be present when school is called for the fol- 
lowing morning. That is not true in our school. The children love 
their teachers ; they are as fond, almost it amounts to adoration, of 
their teachers as is the feeling between the white people and the 
teachers of civilization whom they dearly love. There is a great work 
to be done among the Lamanites, and these good men and women 
who are teaching the children of the Indians, are laying a foundation 
for a future work that shall be gigantic in its scope. 

This brother, whom I have mentioned, asked that the missionaries 
might be magnified in the eyes of the world, and my plea to you 
is that the missionaries on their return to their homes may be magnified 
in the eyes of the people from whom they come. These boys and girls 
who have gone into the world and have acquired a knowledge and a 
testimony of the gospel are full of its spirit, they are desirous of 
spreading a knowledge of God, and it is as desirable that that knowl- 
edge should be spread at home as abroad ; and I appeal to the bishops, 
to presidents of stakes, to the men and women composing our com- 
munities, that they will foster, encourage, and help, and that they 
will see to it that these young men and women have the same op- 
portunity to preach the gospel at home as they have had while they 
have been abroad. We, the presidents of missions, are endeavoring 
to teach them to be, as Bishop Nibley said this morning, courteous 
gentlemen and ladies. We are endeavoring educationally, to give them 
the best that we possess. They will come back to their communities 
rich with the glorious influence that they have imbibed on their mis- 
sions. Let us, brethren and sisters, perpetuate the missionary spirit, 
that our boys and girls possess when they come home, for I testify to 
you that they are the dearest, most valued, the most beautiful of 



76

associates, and they find a place in the hearts of their mission presidents 
second only to our own children. 

May God help us to be kindly, to magnify our own boys and 
girls in our own community, as we have prayed that they be magnified 
in the eyes of the world, is my prayer, and I ask it in the name of the 
Lord Jesus Christ, Amen. 

A tenor solo entitled, "The Plains of Peace" was sung by David 
Cook. 

ELDER B. H. ROBERTS 

( Of the First Council of Seventy and President of the Eastern 
States Mission) 

During the sessions of this conference you have heard from 
many lands, and from many parts of our own country. I am wondering 
what message I can bring to you from the East. Incidentally I may 
say to those of you who are, by the ties of kindred, interested in 
the young men and women who comprise the Eastern States mission, 
that it is a general time of health in our mission, and that there pre- 
vails a very fine spirit among them, but that, of course, is not the 
message I had in mind when I was wondering what message I might 
bring to this conference from the East. At present it seems to 
me to be a good starting point for a message to repeat a scripture 
with which you all are very familiar, namely: 

"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all 
men liberally and upbraideth not, and it shall be given him. 

"But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering; for he that wavereth is . 
like a wave of the sea, driven with the wind and tossed. For let not that 
man think he shall receive anything of the Lord." 

Some of you, perhaps, will recognize that as the cornerstone of 
the history of this last and new dispensation of the gospel. It was 
the .scripture which appealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith in great 
power, conveying to his soul a most solemn message. For, at the time 
he came to contemplate it, in the spring of 1820, he was very much 
perplexed because of the confusion existing everywhere concerning 
religion. 

In the city of Palmyra, near the center of it, there are four 
corners, facing one another. On each stands a church, and these 
churches existed there one hundred years ago. The ministers of those 
four churches united in what was called a "Ujnion Service" ; and for 
weeks a very earnest kind of Christian propaganda was carried on, 
a revival meeting, and great interest was aroused there and throughout 
the surrounding country in religion. All went well, many people were 
drawn to contemplate the religious life, and much good seemed to have 
been accomplished, until the time came when the new converts were 
to file off to the respective churches of their choice, and then strife, 



ELDER B. H. ROBERTS 



77 



division, and confusion confounded, seemed to prevail. This very 
greatly distracted the mind of our Prophet. The questions under con- 
sideration then were such as these — something about the decrees of 
God : Would people be .saved by the free grace of God, and the free 
will of men combined, and would they thus be drawn to the feet of 
the Christ? Or had God pre-determined before the foundation of the 
earth the exact number of those who should be saved, and had so 
definitely fixed upon the number that it could not be increased nor 
diminished by any human effort, by any personal desire, or search- 
ing or seeking after righteousness? Those who were to be saved 
were to be saved by the pre-determined will of God, without any act 
of their own. On the other hand it was just as explicitly known 
who would be reprobate, and they could not escape by any means of 
repentance or other device whatsoever. The question was discussed 
as to whether this pre-destination of men, to salvation or destruction, 
affected infants as well as adults. A division existed, some claim- 
ing that all infants dying in infancy would be saved, and others claimed 
that only those whom the decree of God had fixed for salvation 
would be saved. Would the heathen be saved? That was a ques- 
tion debated. Was baptism essential unto salvation? Would un- 
baptized infants be saved, or were they among the number that it would 
be impossible to save, baptized or not? And so the controversy went 
on. Time will not permit to go into all the details of it, but this 
perhaps will indicate the nature of some of the discussions. 
None of those questions were settled by the debates which occurred, 
but you have been hearing very little about thejn for a long time. 
People have not been discussing them. But the point I desire to bring 
to your attention is this, that notwithstanding the debate on those 
particular questions have ceased, Christendom is not yet united. The 
confusion and divisions have broken out in new places. 

There is a remarkable prophecy in St. Peter's writings to this 
effect: 

"Prophecy came not in olden time by the will of man; but holy men of 
God spake as they were moved upon by the Holy Ghost." 

"But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there 
shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable 
heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon them- 
selves swift destruction. And many shall follow their pernicious ways, 
by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of." 

From the early days of Christianity till now there have been 
tho.se who have denied the Deity of Christ ; but it seems to me that 
these clays of ours have been especially reserved for this particular 
heresy to reach its full development ; namely, the "denial of the Lord 
who bought them," "bought them" by the price of his own suffering, 
and by his own precious blood ; for never in the history of Christianity 
has there been such a denial of the Lord as there is at the present time, 

This recent controversy first arose about two years ago, in Eng- 



78 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



land, when the Reverend Hastings Rashdall, the distinguished dean 
of Carlyle, at the Modern Churchman's Congress, held in Cambridge, 
declared that "Jesus Christ never claimed divinity for himself, and 
was in the fullest sense a man, with not merely a human body, but 
with human soul, intellect and will." "Again," said he, "Jesus may 
have allowed himself to be called the Messiah, but never in any of 
his" — mark the language — "critically, well-attested sayings was there 
anything* which suggests that his conscious relation to God was other 
than that of any man toward God." Then in respect of the fourth 
gospel, as being outside of the Christ's "critically, well-attested sayings," 
the dean remarked : "That the speeches attributed to Christ in the 
Fourth Gospel," St. John's Gospel, "where they go beyond the char- 
acter of Jesus as portrayed in the synoptic gospels, namely, Matthew, 
Mark and Luke, cannot be regarded as authentic history." That 
was the report of his speech at the time, when this agitation first 
began. Then about a year later, namely, in January, 1923, in our 
own country, the United States, the Reverend Percy S. Grant, rector 
of the Church of the Ascension, in New York City, preaching in 
defense of the declaration he had made the Sunday before, namely, 
"when Christ was on earth he did not possess the power of God," 
remarked : "This is certainly the teaching of the first three gospels." 
So that Dr. Grant, like the Dean of Carlyle, sets aside the testimony 
of St. John. As a matter of fact, it would not be difficult to sustain 
the Deity of the Christ from the first three Go.spels, usually spoken 
of as the synoptic Gospels ; and you may leave out St. John's Gos- 
pel, and in those three gospels this great truth concerning the Christ 
is emphasized, namely that he is the Son of God, and it follows that 
being the Son of God, then God — God of God ; Light of Light, of 
the same substance or essence with the Father; of the same attributes. 
It is only thought necessary to establish the truth of Jesus Christ being 
the Son of God to make him Deity; of the same essence with the 
Father, as well as being the "brightness of his glory" and the ex- 
press image of his person. And that is all clearly set forth in the 
synoptic gospels. 

And now, for a peculiar reason, I want to call your attention to 
this thought. This controversy goes beyond the testimonies of the 
witnesses of the New Testament, and brings out a peculiar feature 
in our own special message to the world. If you will recall the very 
careful words of these two critics Messrs. Rashdall and Grant, the 
Diety of the Christ, you will have noted perhaps that they hold that: 
"No critical, well-attested saying of the Christ tends to establish his 
Deity." Well, that simply means that the so-called "modern criticism," 
eliminates and throws to the winds the testimony of Christ's apostles 
in Judea, — the testimony that Jesus is indeed the Christ, the Son of 
God, born of a virgin, and God's Only Begotten Son in the flesh. 

The note now and then occurs in the comments that are made 
on this great controversy, that: "You have got yet to consider the 



ELDER B. H. ROBERTS 79 

i 

authenticity and the credibility of the New Testament documents. 
That is the thing to which I wish to call your attention. Unto Nephi, 
the first Nephi, were given some very great visions concerning the 
life and the mission of the Christ, before he came in the flesh; and 
among other things he saw that the Gentile races upon this North 
American continent would have the testimony of the Hebrew prophets 
among them (the Old Testament) ; and also the testimony of the 
"Twelve Apostles of the Lamb" (the New Testament). He saw that 
these books would be mutilated and corrupted : that the Gentiles would 
go into great darkness and unbelief because of this mutilation of the word 
of God. Then he saw, in vision, circulating among the people other 
records, one of which was to be the word of the Lord to the seed 
of this man Nephi. That other sacred books were to be circulated in 
the land, and these second books, meaning the Book of Mormon, 
the record of the Nephite people, and the revelations of God in this 
new dispensation, clearly recognized in the Doctrine and Covenants, 
and also in the Pearl of Great Price, — these records would establish 
the truth of the record of the Twelve Apostles of the Lamb of God, 
Hence the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints holds in its 
hands, and is commissioned to use these other holy scriptures brought 
forth in this chosen land, speaking from the dust of "Cumorah's 
lonely hill," for the sleeping nations of the American Continent : and the 
living word of God in this age, as contained in the revelations found in 
the Doctrine and Covenants and in the Pearl of Great Price, brought 
forth by the Prophet Joseph Smith, are here to correct the errors of 
those who would throw out of the reckoning the word of God as 
found in the record of the "Twelve Apostles of the Lamb," the New 
Testament; they are here to affirm, with all the strength that comes 
from these volumes of witnesses, — this cloud of witnesses — that Jesus 
is indeed the Christ; that he is the Creator, not only of our own 
world, but of many worlds. (Heb. 1:1, 2; St. John 1:1-4). Also 
that He is the upholding and the sustaining power of all things ; that, 
as pointed out so beautifully in Elder Rulon S. Wells' remarks. He 
is the Vital Force, that "quickeneth all things"; also that he is the 
Intelligence-inspiring Power of God's universe; also that He is the 
Love-manifested Power of God's universe: for the one great thing 
above all others in the mission of the Christ was to give assurance 
and demonstration of the Love of God for the inhabitants of the 
earth. As Jesus himself contemplated this his mission among men, he 
voiced the assurance that — 

"I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me." 

Brethren and sisters, it is our mission to stem the tide of unbelief 
that is in the world, to answer the Christ's question on one occasion 
— when he the Son of man comes, shall He find faith in the earth?" 
In the name of God, yes ! For he has provided the means of main- 
taining faith in Him as Creator, as Sustaining Power of the universe; 
as Vital Force, as Intelligence-inspiring Power, as Love-manifested 



80 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Power, and he has organized his Church in the earth, no more to be 
destroyed, to maintain this faith in the earth. And when the Christ 
shall come in the clouds of heaven, with power and great glory, 
attended by the host of Saints from heaven, the host of Saints here 
on earth, possessed of true faith that Jesus is the Christ, Sovereign, 
Lord and King, Creator of heaven and earth, and all things that 
in them are; the Savior of men, the Redeemer of the world, the very 
Son of God, "the Eternal God," to use the Book of Mormon phrase, 
"manifesting himself unto all nations" — these, the Saints possessed 
of this faith in the earth, shall welcome the Christ and the hosts of 
Saints from heaven, with shouts of great joy and faith. 

The thought I wish to leave with you, and my purpose in quoting 
the text, — "If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God that giveth 
to all men liberally and upbraideth not, and it shall be given him" — was 
to emphasize the fact that there is still great need, in the light of the 
present controversy about the Deity of Christ, to make use of this 
prayer; for the controversies of today, and the confusion resulting 
from them, are just as perplexing as the confusion of a hundred years 
ago. God bless the Saints, and all who would know the truth, in 
the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

i 

The choir and congregation sang, "Now let us rejoice in the day 
of salvation." 

Elder Oliver H. Budge, president of the Logan stake of Zion, 
pronounced the benediction. 

Conference was adjourned until 10 o'clock Sunday morning. 



THIRD DAY 



MORNING SESSION 

Conference opened Sunday morning at 10 o'clock, April 6, 1924. 
All the seats in the tabernacle were occupied and every available stand- 
ing space in the building. Many were unable to gain admission. 
Through a radio device many who were gathered at the Bureau of In- 
formation and at the Barratt Hall, listened through radio instru- 
ments to the proceedings. Besides, in the Assembly Hall, there was an 
overflow meeting at which Elder W. A. Hyde of the Pocatello stake 
presided. 

The choir and congregation sang, "Praise to the man who com- 
muned with Jehovah." 

Elder Moroni Lazenby, president of the North Sevier stake, of- 
fered the opening prayer. 

A duet and chorus was rendered by the choir and Mary Lindsay 
and Cannon Lund, entitled, "An angel from on high." 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 

I cannot express to you, my brethren and sisters, the gratitude 
that I feel to our heavenly Father, and the joy which I experience 
as 1 look upon this great congregation of Latter-day Saints who have 
assembled in general conference to hear the word of the Lord. It 
is a renewed evidence to me. that as the work of the Lord draws 
nearer its consummation, the invisible forces of the spirit world are 
operating upon the hearts of the people, drawing them nearer to- 
gether, uniting them in faith, and preparing them for the great events 
which are before us, even at our very doors. 

THE MULTITUDE COMPARED WITH AN ANCIENT GATHERING 

As we stood up for the opening hymn, I thought of these words 
which are recorded in the Book of Mormon. King Benjamin had 
sent out an invitation to the Nephite people to gather together at 
the temple in the land of Zarahemla. When they assembled it was 
discovered that the temple was not large enough to contain all of 
the people, so he ordered a tower erected upon the outside, that he 
might address them from that spot. But still the people could not hear ; 
so many had assembled. So he ordered that the words which he 
spoke be written and distributed among them, in order that they 
might all know the things which he was about to declare. This 
house is filled to overflowing with people. The Assembly Hall is 



82 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



full, and there are still multitudes upon the outside who cannot be 
accommodated in either of these buildings. 

PROCEEDINGS OF A CHARACTER TO STIMULATE FAITH 

The entire proceedings of the conference, my brethren and sisters, 
have been of a character, I am sure, to stimulate faith, to cause our 
minds to revert to the simple but fundamental doctrines of the gos- 
pel by which we are kept in harmony with the Spirit of the Lord. 

AUTHORITY CONFERRED UPON THE APOSTLES 

I thought yesterday, as the meetings progressed, of these words 
which are recorded here in the last chapter of St. Matthew : 

"Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain 
where Jesus had appointed them. 

"And when they saw him, they worshiped him; but some doubted" 
(for this was after his resurrection from the dead). 

"And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given 
unto me in heaven and in earth. 

"Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name 
of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost: 

"Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded 
you; and lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world." 

It was the last .sentence, expressed in these words of the Redeemer, 
to which my attention was particularly drawn, "teaching them to 
observe all things whatsoever I have commanded." and if they 
do this, "Lo, I am with you unto the end of the world." 

Two years prior to the time when this commission was given, 
the Redeemer had called to him the Twelve Disciples whom he had 
chosen, and instructed them to go to the lost sheep of the House 
of Israel, and declared to them that the kingdom of heaven was at 
hand. They were to go, putting their trust in the Lord, with the 
promise that he would protect them, would provide food and clothing 
and deliver them from the hands of enemies, who might ,seek to 
harm them. 

At the time of his appearance to the Nephites, after his resur- 
rection from the dead, the Redeemer called twelve men upon whom 
he conferred authority to call the people to repentance and faith 
in him, and to baptize all who believed, for the remission of sins, after 
which he promised them the Gift of the Holy Ghost. 

LIKE AUTHORITY CONFERRED UPON THE TWELVE IN OUR DAY 

It is quite natural, then, and in harmony with the well-defined 
order of the Church, that with the restoration of the work of the 
Lord in the dispensation in which we live, twelve men should be 
chosen upon whom the apostleship was conferred, and to whom the 
command of the Lord was renewed ; for he commanded these twe'.ve : 
to go into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature, 
who had not received it, baptizing them in the name of the Father 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 



83 



and the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, and conferring upon the bap- 
tized believer, the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands. 

So important are these first principles of the gospel that in the 
early days of the Church the Lord commanded Martin Harris that 
he should preach nothing else. 

THE ORDINANCE OF BAPTISM 

Initiation into the Church is an event of tremendous importance, 
to one who accepts it. So important was it regarded in the primitive 
Church that we are told that the ordinance of baptism was administered 
to none except those who took upon them the name of Christ, with a 
determination to serve him, and came forth with broken hearts and 
contrite spirits, manifesting to the Church that they had truly repented 
of all of their sins. To one who has thus prepared himself, the 
ordinance of baptism washes away hi,s sins, and he is born to newness 
of life. He stands clean before the Lord, an heir to glory, exaltation 
and eternal life — not definitely, but conditionally ; for in exchange 
for this priceless gift he enters into covenant that he will take upon 
him in the name of Christ, and always remember him and keep the 
commandments which he has given. If we violate this covenant, it 
were better never to have made it. 

To be admitted into the Church, then, is but to have our feet 
placed in the straight and narrow path which, if we diligently pur- 
sue our way, will lead us back to God from whence we came. Having 
been born to newness of life, Latter-day Saints should lay off the 
habiliments of the carnal man, and clothe themselves in robes of 
righteousness, that is to say, our mode of life should correspond, in 
all respects, with our profession of faith. 

TO BE IN POSSESSION OF THE SPIRIT OF GOD WE MUST PRAY 

In order that we may retain a remission of our sins, it is neces- 
sary that we be constantly in possession of the Spirit of the Lord, 
and the medium through which we obtain and retain his Spirit is 
prayer. Prayer is the outward act by which we manifest our faith 
in the Lord. It is not the multiplicity of words which are uttered, 
that brings the desired blessings, but the degree of faith with which 
we approach our Father who is in heaven. It is mockery to pray 
to a being in whose power to hear and answer we have no faith, 
as I have often thought that some men do today. The Lord, re- 
ferring to this subject, warned us that when we pray we are not to 
be like the hypocrites who love to pray standing in the synagogues 
and on the corners of the streets that they may be heard of men, 
nor to use vain repetition, thinking to be heard for our much speak- 
ing, neither are public prayers alone sufficient, important though 
they are in their time and place, but we are admonished that we should 
pray in secret, and the definite promise is made that the prayer of 
faith, so offered, shall be rewarded openly.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



HUMILITY SHOULD CHARACTERIZE OUR CONDUCT 

The doctrine of humility, taught in this lesson given us by the 
Redeemer, should characterize the conduct of Latter-day Saints in all 
of the activities of life, for he has told us that we should be clothed 
upon with humility, for God resists the proud and giveth grace to 
the humble. And he tells us that as we wax stronger in humility, 
we become firmer in the faith unto the filling of our souls with joy. 

Latter-day Saints .should seek wisdom and learn the value of 
righteousness and justice; they should patiently submit to persecution 
when it is for righteousness sake, be slow to anger, quick to forgive, 
merciful, but always just. They should be peacemakers constantly 
striving both by precept and example to bring to pass the universal 
brotherhood of man. 

GOOD WILL AND FORGIVENESS FUNDAMENTAL 

It is fundamental to the faith of all creeds that man should 
not take the life of his fellow. The Redeemer went further than 
this, teaching that he who is angry with his brother will not be held 
guiltless. He taught us that when differences arise between brethren, 
they should be settled quickly, and when once adjusted, are not to 
be the subject of further discussion or comment; that we should be 
men and women of few words, reaching conclusions quickly, but 
wisely, as circumstances may justify; making our decision yes or 
no, and let that be the end of controversy. 

The law of Moses taught the doctrine of retaliation for wrong 
inflicted. The Master teaches that we are not to resist evil, but 
patiently submit to the offences of others, that we should not only 
love our friends, but our enemies also ; that we should bless those 
who curse us, do good to those who hate us, and pray for those 
who despitefully use us and persecute us — a thing not easy of ac* 
complishment ; but nevertheless a direct commandment, and one which 
brings to the soul of those who apply it the satisfaction of a righteous 
act performed. 

EXERCISE CHARITY WITHOUT OSTENTATION 

In this age of organized charity, when the contributions which 
we make to provide for the necessities of those who have not, are 
advertised to the world, and we love to be known as liberal givers, 
it is well to turn again to the word of the Lord, for he has told 
us that when we give alms we are to see to it that it be not before 
men, to be seen of them, otherwise we have no reward of our Father 
which is in Heaven ; that we are not to sound a trumpet before us as the 
hypocrites do, that we may have the honors of men, but that we, when 
we give alms, are not to let our left hand know what our right hand 
doeth. In other words, the alms which we give should be contributed 
for the love of giving, and with desire to administer to the neces- 
sities of others, rather than for the praise of men. It was this, my 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. WINS

brethren and sisters, which made the widows mite .more acceptable to 
the Lord than all that others had cast into the treasury. 

SEEK WISDOM AND NOT WEALTH 

Having become members of the Church, taking upon us the 
name of Christ, acknowledging our dependence upon him and enter- 
ing into covenant that we will serve him and keep his commandments, 
the Lord has told us that we are not to devote our energies to the 
accumulation of wealth, that we shall not seek after riches, but after 
wisdom, and those things which bring eternal blessings ; for he says 
that riches and the honors which men bestow will canker the soul, 
if not used for the glory of God, and that the lament of the rich, 
who have not used their wealth for the accomplishment of good, will 
be: "The harvest is over, the summer is passed, and our souls are 
not saved." Neither will poverty in itself bring blessings. It is 
the poor who are reconciled to their lot, and the rich who are poor 
in spirit, with whom the Lord is well pleased. He has admonished 
us that we are not to devote our energies to the accumulation of 
wealth for this reason, that we cannot devotedly and acceptably serve 
two Masters. He .says that we will either neglect one or the other. 
We cannot faithfully, as we should, serve both God and Mammon. 
Therefore he admonishes us that we should lay up treasures in heaven, 
where moth and rust do not corrupt, nor thieves break in and steal. 

BE SLOW TO RENDER JUDGMENT AND CRITICISM 

The Lord has plainly told us that we should be wise and judicious, 
that we should be slow to render judgment or criticism of our fellows; 
for he has told us that with the judgment which we mete out to 
others, we ourselves will be judged. How often, how readily, we 
detect and magnify the faults of our neighbors, while we overlook 
our own imperfections. How often we seek to pull the mote from the 
eye of our brother, and forget the beam which is in our own. "There- 
fore," saith the Lord, "judge not, and ye shall not be judged; con- 
demn not, and ye shall not be condemned ; forgive and ye shall be 
forgiven." In other words, whatsoever ye would that men shall do 
unto you, do ye even so unto them — an admonition of the Lord, carry- 
ing with it one of the most sublime principles ever uttered by the 
tongue of man. 

FAST WITH CHEERFUL COUNTENANCE 

Fasting is a doctrine of the Church. Here again the Lord has 
told us that when we fast we are not to be as the hypocrites who 
disfigure their faces, that they may appear to the world to fast; 
but we are to wash our faces and with cheerful countenance appear 
to men not to fast; and the definite promise is made that the Lord, 
who seeth in secret, will reward us openly.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



honor marriage; be chaste and virtuous 

The marital relations of the world, — and to a certain degree it 
applies to the Church — were referred to yesterday by Bishop Nibley. 
Here again is a matter which is deserving of our most careful at- 
tention and consideration. The fountains of life, designed by the 
Creator for the reproduction of humankind, and sacred to the marital 
relation only, are made the plaything of faithless, godless men and 
women. The holy bonds of matrimony, the only order which gives 
proper sanction to the association of the sexes, is entered into and dis- 
solved at will. These conditions are, in my opinion, the most danger- 
ous menaces to our national life which exists today. The Lord pleads 
with us to honor the association of man and woman in lawful wed- 
lock, and makes plain to us the penalties which are attached to the 
violation of laws of chastity and virtue, both in this life and that to come, 
and appeals to us that we shall observe these laws, which are the crown 
of matrimony, and should be held by us as sacred as life itself. 

WHY THESE SIMPLE DOCTRINES SHOULD BE IMPLICITLY OBSERVED 

I have referred to these simple, but indispensable doctrines of the 
Church, because it appears necessary to me to do so. We are living 
in the day referred to by the Prophet Isaiah, who said that the 
nations should rush as the rushing of mighty waters, but God would 
rebuke them. 

I sometimes fear, my brethren and sisters, that in this mad rush 
for wealth, for power, for personal aggrandizement, this age of dis- 
honesty in high places, disregard for law, and indifference to virtue, 
and religion, that we may be caught in the swirling flood and car- 
ried on to destruction unless we revert to those simple but funda- 
mental doctrines of the Gospel, and put our trust in the Lord, re- 
newing our covenants with him, that his arm may sustain us. 

We are living at the time seen by Lehi, the Nephite prophet, 
when, because of the darkness, which covered the earth, many peo- 
ple who had entered into the straight and narrow path which leads 
to eternal life, as we have done, lost their way and perished. But 
those who seized and held fast to the rod of iron, which is the word 
of God, found their way safely through the dark night until they 
reached the tree of life, and partook of its fruit, which is more de- 
sirable than all others. 

WARNING AGAINST BECOMING LIKE THE PHARISEES OF OLD 

The commission given to the Twelve who hold the apostleship 
today is to go into the world and preach the gospel to all people, 
admonishing them to rely upon the merits of our Father, to take up- 
on them the name of Christ and to keep all of the commandments 
which he has given, to only a few of which I have called your at- 
tention. We must not my brethren and sisters become so absorbed 
with the temporalities of life, with the weighty and abstruse doctrines 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 



87 



of the gospel, that we forget these simple and fundamental doctrines 
of the Church to which I have called your attention, lest we become 
like the Scribes and Pharisees of old, of whom the Redeemer said : 
"Ye diligently pay your tithes and offerings, but ye forget the more 
weighty thing's of the law, judgment, justice and mercy. These," he said, 
"you should have kept and not left the others undone." 

REMEMBER THESE SIMPLE, FUNDAMENTAL DOCTRINES 

May the Lord help us all, my brethren and sisters, for I am speak- 
ing to myself as well as to you, to remember these simple funda- 
mental doctrines of the gospel of Christ, that our lives may be such 
that the Spirit of the Lord may abide with us, and the revelations of 
heaven be manifested to us through the whispering of the Holy Spirit, 
which has been conferred upon every one of us, the office work of 
which is to take the things of the Father and make them known to 
us, that we may each discharge with honor before the Lord the 
obligations which are upon us, and wait patiently the development 
of his work, that we may bring to pass the redemption of his cove- 
nant people, the establishment of righteousness in the earth, when 
Christ shall reign triumphant among his people, is my humble prayer, 
through Jesus Christ, Amen. 

President Grant announced to the congregation outside that it 
would be acceptable if they would be as quiet as possible and move 
around as little as possible so that those who were standing at the 
Bureau of Information could hear the speakers. 

ELDER HYRUM G. SMITH 

( Presiding Patriarch of the Church ) 

It is a wonderful opportunity to stand here and face this multi- 
tude of people, and I am sure some of you realize that it is a wonderful 
responsibility. I hope to enjoy the Spirit of the Lord the few moments 
I stand here, in keeping with the brethren who have already occupied 
this position. I have learned, to a certain degree, the weight of 
responsibility that has come to me as one of the youths of Israel, one 
of the young men of Zion, in these the last days. 

President Ivins has been speaking to us concerning the com- 
mandments of the Lord, and how these commandments have been 
taught to us of the Lord, at different times in the history of the world. 
We are aware of the fact that the Lord has spoken to us in plainness, 
and that his commandments are given to us in our own language, 
simple, plain and forceful, and yet many of us are so blinded by 
the conditions that surround us, perhaps by the fashions of the world, 
with which we are surrounded, that we fail in many ways to keep 
the commandments of the Lord. I suppose, my experience has given 



88 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



me as good a view as any officer in the Church, to judge about how 
well the Latter-day Saints keep the commandments of the Lord. I 
think also that the Lord has made me in a way rather sympathetic, 
and when I discover my brethren or sisters seeking the Lord, for 
comfort, blessings, strength, courage, faith, and for other gifts or 
blessings, or help, I stand ready, naturally, to do my part in assisting 
to see that the desired comfort, and consolation, are received. But 
I have discovered that the greater number of those who are seeking 
comfort and consolation and help from the Lord are those who are in 
trouble, those who have unfortunately stumbled over some of the 
obstacles that have crossed their pathway. And so there are a great 
many members of the Church who are constantly seeking for help, 
comfort, and consolation, and the Lord in his kindness, in the great 
and wonderful organization of his Church, has placed officers there- 
in to assist in administering the comfort and consolation which his 
children naturally seek. 

I should like to bring to the attention of the members of the 
Church these noble and worthy officers whom the Lord has placed 
in his Church, they are stationed throughout the Stakes of Zion 
just as well as at the head of the Church. They are noble, exemplary 
and worthy men. They are the Patriarchs in the Church and are 
authorized with the powers and the keys of authority, to administer 
the blessings desired by the members of the Church. It is my purpose 
on this occasion, my brethren and sisters, to recommend these good 
men to you, to administer your blessings, in keeping with the in- 
structions which have come to us from the Lord through his holy 
servants. They are modest in their character; they dislike very much 
to come to you and .say: "Well now, here I am, a servant of the 
Lord, authorized with all the keys, authorities and powers to bless you, 
and I am ready, ask and you shall receive." It is not their purpose 
to come to you, particularly, but it is your privilege to go to them ; 
they are authorized to act for you, and it is my faith and my testimony 
to you brethren and sisters, that they are humble and pure enough 
to act in their calling, and give unto you the blessings of the Lord, 
and not entirely the blessings of men. It is true that we, as fellow- 
men, can bless one another. We can encourage and comfort each 
other ; but these men of whom I speak, who bear the holy Priesthood, 
have been especially authorized, called and set apart, they are author- 
ized to comfort you with the blessings of the Lord. So I recommend 
that you do not slight or forget these good men. Pray for them 
as you would pray for your own household. Pray for them that 
they may enjoy the spirit of their office and calling in the Church. 

In olden days, patriarchs were placed in Israel to perform ordin- 
ances for Christ, by the laying on of hands. Adam called his poster- 
ity together and foretold unto them the great future that might be- 
fall them, for their benefit, comfort, and guidance, and inj like 
manner these men are placed in our midst for that same purpose, to 
comfort, guide and sustain us in the fold of Christ. I have been 



ELDER HYRUM G. SMITH 



89 



convinced that there is a blessing for every faithful member of the 
Church. It is true there are many members who have had other 
blessings, and if they are considered in a proper light, I am sure they 
have done no harm, and perhaps will do no harm in the future. 
But I think every faithful member of the Church should receive 
his or her blessing. 

The first Patriarch in this dispensation, the father of our Prophet, 
when he was upon his dying bed, called his family around him and 
gave them his dying blessing ; and when his oldest living son came, 
he said : "Hyrum, the only blessing I have for you is to reconfirm upon 
you your patriarchal blessing which you have already received." That 
was his dying blessing, with very few other remarks of comfort and con- 
solation; this assures me that there is a fundamental principle in a 
patriarchal blessing when pronounced and recorded. It is an eternal 
anchor for our soul with the Lord ; so it is not particularly necessary 
to receive a multitude of written blessings. But when these blessings 
are given and properly recorded, they are just as eternal and binding 
upon us through our faithfulness as were the blessines which were 
given by Adam, Abraham, Jacob or any of the former patriarchs in 
the times which have passed. 

I have open here before me the Book of Genesis, which contains 
the records of a number of patriarchal blessings. They are not long, 
they do not cover pages and pages of manuscript, but they are very 
brief and pointed ; and it has taken generations of time, many years 
of time, for their fulfilment ; in fact, they are not entirely fulfilled 
yet — 'blessings that were given upon the heads of the descendants of 
Joseph who was sold into Egypt, and upon the sons of Jacob. 

So, my brethren and sisters, if you will discover the keynote of 
your blessing it will not be a long one, necessarily, but an index that 
will point to you the book of life, the book of the way of your life, 
in the path that you should go to serve God and to keep his com- 
mandments. So, I say, do not wait until you are in trouble to go 
to the Lord, through his holy servants, but seek them out in their 
homes, in their offices, make appointments with them and get your 
blessings. 

My heart is filled, today, with compassion and with the bless- 
ings of the Lord for his people, and I pray that our Father in heaven 
will continue to pour out his blessings upon this Church, upon those 
who are called to preside over it, and in it, that he will sustain them 
with health, strength, wisdom, and with his Holy Spirit, that he will 
bless the people in their homes and in their fields of labor, the Saints 
both gathered and scattered, that they may enjoy the Spirit of the 
Lord, and live exemplary lives, free from the follies and vices of 
the world, even though we are much surrounded by the world. Let 
us be that peculiar people which the Lord declared he would have. Let 
us hearken unto the whisperings of the Holy Spirit, and to the teach- 
ings given us, not only in general conferences, but in our quarterly 
conferences and in all of our local gatherings. And in the name 



90 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



of the Lord, as his humble servant, I bless this multitude present 
here today, and say unto you: Serve the Lord and keep his com- 
mandments. Hearken unto that small voice, which is the voice of the 
Holy Spirit, which will guide you in the way of truth, in the way 
of life, and then you will receive the precious blessings which you 
desire, in faithfulness and which have been nobly pointed out to us 
this morning by President Ivins. They are the blessings of the Lord, 
and they will be upon you and upon this people, so long as we will 
serve the Lord ; the Lord of this Church, this land, this world ; for 
this world is his, and we are his, and if we will only hearken unto 
his teachings, he will bless us temporally and spiritually. God bless 
you all through your faithfulness, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

The anthem, "He watches over Israel," was sung by the choir. 

ELDER REY L. PRA IT 

(President of the Mexican .fission) 

I assure you, my brethren and sisters, that I sense very keenly 
the responsibility of addressing you for a few moments this morning, 
and my only desire is to add my testimony to those that have been 
borne by the brethren who have spoken during this conference relative 
to the truthfulness of the work in which we are all engaged. 

Since the beginning of this conference the words of the Apostle 
Paul to the Corinthian saints have been passing through my mind, 
wherein he said : 

"For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power." And 
I am most thankful to the Lord that in this day and age in which 
we live he has again set up his kingdom and established his Church 
and restored his gospel, and in them has placed his power ; for I testify 
to you, this morning that the Prophet Joseph Smith was raised up of 
God, and did not take unto himself power, but from our Father in 
heaven received power to establish this great work ; and the work ol 
the Lord, in this day and age in which we live, is characterized by 
the power of our Father in heaven in all of its ramifications. We 
who have listened to the inspired words of our Prophet and leader 
and his counselors, and the Twelve Apostles in this conference, surely 
are witnesses of the power of God that has accompanied their words. 
I marveled last night, when we saw the body of this hall filled with 
men bearing the holy Priesthood, at the wonderful power there is in 
this Church for the work of the ministry, for the perfecting of the 
Saints, for the preaching of the gospel, for the warning of all men 
everywhere in order that they may turn from error, from false tradi- 
tions, and receive the principles of the gospel and be saved in the 
kingdom of our Father in heaven. 

I bear witness to you, my brethren and sisters, as one who labors 



ELDER REY L. PRATT 



91 



in the mission field abroad, that the young men who go forth from 
Zion to preach the gospel unto the nations of the earth, are preaching 
it in power. They speak truly after the manner of the Master, and 
men marvel, and are led to comment and say, "They speak as men 
having authority." There is no doubt as to the genuineness, the sin- 
cerity, of the testimonies borne; by the young men who preach the gos- 
pel message in the world. While many people do not accept their 
teachings, they do not question their sincerity. And this is a tribute, I 
take it, to the great power that accompanies their ministry in the 
world. 

I know that the gospel is true. I have no definite knowledge as 
to what my status or standing will be in the future. I do not know 
that I shall be able to maintain my integrity and my faith, but I do 
know, and bear witness to you here today, that the thing known as 
"Mormonism" is the gospel of Jesus Christ ; it is the power of God 
unto salvation, and it is a means unto the salvation of every man who 
will believe and obey its principles. This is the message that we are 
delivering in the world. I care not what obstacles present themselves 
before this work. The Lord himself has said, that even though the 
gates of hell combat against it, they shall not prevail. I have faith in 
the fulfilment of all that God has promised unto his people in these 
days. Particularly I wish to refer to my faith in the promises of the 
Lord made by his holy prophets concerning the redemption of the 
Lamanite people. My heart was touched yesterday by the recital of 
Brother Levi Edgar Young of the Indian brothers who crossed this 
continent, going to the East, in an endeavor to bring back with them 
that which would save their people. The pathos of their having to go 
back without it was truly touching to me, my brethren and sisters. Ana 
now I rejoice that God has restored the truth, that he has made known 
a book and brought it forth in the world, that is the history of the fore- 
fathers of these people. And in that book is prophetically held out a 
hope for the redemption of the Lamanite people everywhere. 

We are laboring in a land beset by strife and turmoil, trouble and 
revolution. It would seem almost sufficient to discourage us in our 
efforts. But I wish to bear testimony that my faith grows, rather than 
diminishes, in the knowledge that I have, that God will, in his own due 
time and in his own way, redeem the Lamanite people. 

I delight to bring word to the fathers and mothers of the faithful 
boys and girls — for they are mere youths — who are in that mission, 
•that they are enjoying good health, and above all, they are enjoying 
the spirit of their mission. They do not wish to turn to the right nor 
to the left, but are willing to face conditions as they find them, and 
humbly preach the gospel, in the hope that their testimony may touch 
the hearts of the people and bring them to a knowledge of God, and 
a knowledge of their forefathers, and the gospel whereby they may 
be redeemed. 

I am thankful to the Lord for giving me this testimony. I pray 



92 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



that it may always be with me, and with you my brethren and sisters, 
and that we may go on without fear and without doubt, remember- 
ing this, that in the Church is the power of God that can work his will 
for the redemption of all men everywhere. May the Lord add his 
blessings, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 

I should like to speak for the fathers and the mothers of the 
Church and in their behalf say to the young people of the Church : 

A MESSAGE TO THE YOUTH OF ZION 

Young men and young women, we believe in you ; we have con- 
fidence in your integrity, and in the achievement of your high destiny. 
We support you, we love you. I believe if we could make the young 
people of the Church understand that, we should have gone a long 
way to hold them to the standards of the Church and to the keep- 
ing of the commandments which have occupied in their exposition, 
such a large portion of this conference. 

THE GREAT OBLIGATION OF PARENTS 

I was very grateful that President Grant was led in the course 
of his opening remarks to restate and reemphasize the great obligation 
of parents to their children ; for it is that thing which seems to me, 
above all others, to claim our attention as a Church. We are depend- 
ing upon the rising generation to carry forward this great and mighty 
work. Only a few years at best will serve to see the men whom 
you will sustain here today as the prophets and authorities of this 
great institution, pass to their honorable reward. The burdens of 
administration, the opportunities of leadership must, in natural sequence, 
pass to other and younger shoulders. So that, loving the work as 
we do, believing in its great accomplishments for the future, we must, 
of necessity, hold and claim these young people to carry it forward, 
to stand for and maintain God's work. 

I think they need at this time large sympathy from us. When 
I contemplate the environment in which they are placed, the unusual 
conditions surrounding them, my heart goes out to every one who 
must stand for honest manhood and resist untoward influences and 
maintain himself in accordance with the commandments of God and 
the standards of the Church. 

UNUSUAL EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENT INFLUENCES THE YOUTH 

Do you contemplate the fact that the great educational forces 
surrounding the youth of today are most unusual, that in the major 
portion they did not exist a few decades ago? There were no 
moving pictures twenty or twenty-five years ago, and within that 
short space of time, that great enterprise which produces these pictures 



ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 



93 



and distributes them all over the world for the education, mind you, 
of the people of the world, and the youth of the land in particular, has 
come to be, it is said, the fourth largest commercial enterprise in 
the world. Thousands and thousands every day are subjected to the 
influence and the education of these pictures. What that education 
is, you may judge for yourselves. What lessons are taught, you 
yourselves have seen, and that our young people should respond to 
those lessons is as natural as it is for flowers to grow in the sunshine, 
or f or vegetation to die in the dark, depressing, poisonous atmosphere 
of a cellar. 

Many inventions and innovations of the past few years have also 
wrought their influences upon these boys and girls so susceptible to 
their environment. There has been the advent of the automobile, 
radios, new kinds and varieties of drama, of music, or that which 
is said to be music, all of which just as naturally and as inevitably 
influence and determine the emotions, and in a large respect, the 
actions of these boys and girls, as it is possible to do. A man can, 
only with the greatest of restraint and of force, take himself out of 
his environment and stand against the influences inserted against him 
in society. It is harder for young people than it is for adults to do 
that, because their natures are more susceptible and impressionable 
to the influences around about them. 

AN APPEAL TO PARENTS IN BEHALF OF THE YOUNG FOLKS 

In behalf of all these young folks up and down the Church, I 
would like to say to the parents of the Church : We claim your 
sympathy. We need your guiding hand, but we need your guidance 
expressed in terms of love and understanding. I feel that in many 
instances the young folks of the Church are not fully understood. I 
;do not like to hear them berated, I do not like to hear it said that 
they have all gone wrong and that they are all going wrong. I do 
not believe it, because I believe that these young folks, by right have 
inherited, fundamentally, the faith of their fathers. They have in- 
herited a disposition to serve God. That is the natural and logical 
sequence of the lives of the great pioneers of this country who came 
here to serve him and keep his commandments, and establish his great 
and mighty work. Therefore, I cannot think that in the main the 
young people of this Church are not the best, the most dependable, 
the most progressive and the finest young generation which the world, 
at least within the realm of history, has ever seen. 

Sometimes parents, out of a great desire to be helpful and to 
warn against danger and evil, assume an austerity that is forbidding 
to these young folks, and too often, much too often, there is a failure 
of that sympathetic understanding which makes a bond of union and 
love between parents and children than which there is no greater bul- 
wark of safety for the young people of the Church. I appeal to every 
parent in this Church to understand his children. To understand them 



94 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



he must, to some extent at least, participate in their activities and rec- 
reation. He must delve into their inmost longings and cravings and 
aspirations. He must know the things that have appealed to them, 
and then discriminately, wisely, sympathetically, he shall guide them, 
guide them in the paths of truth and of righteousness. 

VISIONS OF WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY OF THE HOME 

What we need today is an interpretation of the gospel of Jesus 
Christ in terms of joyous living. The gospel is not, as many of our 
young folks think it to be, a hard, a joy-killing rule of life. I some- 
times think that our young people are dissuaded from participation 
in the activities of the Church because there has never been given, 
to many of them at least, the great vision of the wonderful opportunity, 
the joys, the happiness, the services which are to be had 
within it. We need to let them know that for happiness, 
for supreme joy, for those permanent satisfactions that go 
to make life worth living, there is no course in life com- 
parable to the course laid down by the blessed gospel of our Lord 
and our Savior. They do not all understand that. They do not 
all recognize the great joy to be had from participation within our 
Church institutions, and it is our great mission in the various in- 
stitutions of the Church, and primarily in that greatest of all Church 
institutions, the home, to give that joyous conception of the principles 
of the gospel. 

THE GOSPEL A CONSTRUCTIVE PROGRAM 

Our gospel is not a gospel of negation. It is true that we are 
commanded to eschew evil and to avoid many things which present 
themselves in forms of temptation, but our gospel is a positive up- 
lifting, constructive program, making life happy if we will but sub- 
scribe to its tenets and live up to the commandments as they have 
been given to us. 

I think that the Christian church of the world has itself to blame 
for its failure in really teaching the gospel of Christ. It is largely 
because of the attitude taken by many of its leaders, whose long- 
faced piety and joy-killing aspect have never been pleasing to young 
people. It is said by the critics of Christ that, "Christ is the prophet 
of the weak ; on the contrary, he came to give strength to the languish- 
ing, and to raise up those trodden under foot to be higher than kings. 
They say that his is the religion of the sick and of the dying, and 
yet he heals the sick and brings the sleeping to life. They say that 
he is against life, and yet he conquers death; that he is the God of 
sadness, and yet he exhorts his followers to be joyful and promises 
an everlasting banquet of joy to his friends. They say he introduced 
sadness and mortification into the world, and on the contrary when 
he was alive he ate and drank, and let his feet and hair be perfumed, 
and detested hypocritical fasts, and the penitential mummeries of 
vanity. Many have left Christ because they never knew him."

OH, THAT BOYS AND GIRLS MIGHT KNOW JESUS CHRIST 

Oh, how I want our boys and girls to know Jesus Christ, the 
Redeemer of men! How I wish that they would recognize that he 
is their dearest and their greatest friend, that they may put their 
trust in him, knowing that he will never forsake them, and that a 
testimony of his divinity and his great work is the greatest influence 
that will ever come into their lives. 

Brethren and sisters, it is our mission and our duty to give them 
that testimony, for the enrichment of their souls, and for that salva- 
tion, for which we all labor and strive. God bless the youth of 
Zion, that they may accomplish their high and noble destiny in the 
purposes of the Lord, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 



ELDER SEYMOUR B. YOUNG 

(President of the First Council of Seventy) 

In this exalted position, being honored to stand before this mag- 
nificent congregation, I hope to voice the sentiments of my heart in 
the testimony which I hope to bear to you today. 

The gospel is true. God has indeed spoken from the heavens 
and called into being the power that has resulted in the organization 
of this great people constituting the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints. 

"Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. 
"He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; and he that believeth 
not shall be damned," or condemned. 

Time since the organization of the Church has proved this great 
fact, that the majority of mankind are not prepared or preparing them- 
selves to receive the word of the Lord. Nearly one hundred years 
have passed since the organization of the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints, and yet among the eighteen hundred millions, or 
two thousand millions of peoples of the earth, the true Church, as 
we view it and testify for it, has only about a half million members, 
proving beyond a question of a doubt that the great majority of man- 
kind has something to attract their attention besides their soul's salva- 
tion. Rather than contemplate the future and prepare for future life, 
it would seem that the large majority of the people of the earth are 
preparing for .social and pleasant enjoyment of the present day, giving 
to themselves all the pleasures of life that they can gather, and seem- 
ingly not impressed at all with the great future and the great re- 
ward that will come to those who serve the Lord and keep his com- 
mandments. 

I am very glad to stand here today and look over this great 
congregation, this large Tabernacle filled to its capacity; and seem- 
ingly every face, so far as I can observe, is anxiously turned this way.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Every person seems devoted and determined to hear the words that 
are spoken by the servants of the Lord. 

This is a day of prosperity for the Latter-day Saints. We are 
in the midst of a very prosperous season. The years that have gone 
since the great World War terminated have marked this nation of 
ours with wonderful, I might almost say supreme, prosperity. The 
earth has brought forth in its strength all the necessaries of life, and 
the luxuries; while there are, as we know, nations on the continents 
of Europe, Asia and Africa, that are suffering with hunger, and in 
the colder climates with cold, for want of proper clothing; and yet 
this nation of ours prospers, as it is being well supplied with the food 
crops necessary for prolongation of life, with health and means for 
sufficient clothing, and the comforts of home. While this is evidenced 
here, it is also made plain to us- that there is plenty ot room for the 
disposition of wealth and comforts of life to those starving millions 
on the other side of the ocean ; and I believe that there has no other 
nation responded so readily to those calls of necessity by the agencies 
that have been established, there is no other nation, so far as I know, 
that has stood so loyally and so promptly in the gap to help to .sustain 
life in the midst of these suffering nations, and for the prompt reply, 
favorably, to the calls that have been made, from time to time, by 
these nations. I believe that for this reason we are thus blessed and 
prospered today. F"or we have not refused, but have always sent, and 
given largely, and many times in excess of all demands. At least there 
is a united purpose in the midst of our nation, seeking to relieve the 
sufferings of those who are hungry and cold. 

When the Church was organized, on the 6th day of April, — 
by the by, this is the 6th of April, the 94th anniversary — there was 
considerable disturbance in the minds of religious peoples, and from 
those very religious or social gatherings came largely the opposition 
to the Prophet Joseph Smith and to his calling and position as a 
Prophet of the Lord. Thus the gospel of Jesus Christ has been com- 
pelled, through those recognized servants of the Lord, to fight its 
way through, and by and by, from the time of its organization, I suppose, 
with the hope of some day living in peace with our neighbors. That 
day seems to have dawned. We are in peaceful relationship with 
our neighbors, and with everybody, so far as we can get into their 
circles with the gospel truths. Never before, I believe, have we had 
such splendid ministrations in our great missions, I mean as to com- 
petent elders and competent missionaries of both sexes ; and today 
we rejoice in the testimonies of the brethren who are at the head of 
these missions of the Church. They believe that they are making 
progress in every department of the work, and I am glad to hear the 
testimonies of my brethren from this stand, for they all bespeak a 
characteristic of perfect faith and knowledge in the outcome of this 
work, in its being superior to any other religious work that is now 
being established. From the President of the Church to the least and 



ELDER SEYMOUR B. YOUNG

last member, each of those occupying a lesser position, as they have 
testified here during this conference, and as they will continue to do 
until it is closed, we hear nothing but what is prompted by the spirit 
of the Lord, by the testimony of a faithful Latter-day Saint. In each 
and every case, nothing but the free spirit of progress has been 
expressed here, and nothing but pure testimonies of the gospel of 
Jesus Chiist have been heard from the lips of the speakers. 

Today will probably see the sustaining vote of the congregation, 
as they are called to vote for the officers of the Church. 1 do not believe, 
with the circumstances with which we are surrounded, and the spirit 
of this great congregation, that there will be one dissenting vote or 
one contrary to sustaining the authorities of the Church, when the 
vote shall be taken sometime during the day. 

I am glad to be associated with the Latter-day Saints. I began 
my experience at one year of age, at which time I went through 
the experience of the massacre at Haun's Mill. I attended a fair 
in one of the nearby cities a year or two ago, and I saw within the 
gates of the fair grounds a stone, an old-fashioned burr stone, as we 
used to call them, for grinding grain. You know it speaks in the 
Scriptures of the upper and nether mill-stone. And one of these stones, it 
was stated on a placard, was taken from the old well where twenty 
"Mormons" were buried after a battle with the citizens of the surround- 
ing country. I said to the people standing by : "That does not tell 
the truth. It was not a battle, it was a bloody massacre of innocent 
men who had no means of defense." And, by the by, the toll exacted 
at that massacre was the largest of any at any one time that had 
ever been taken from the Church. The deaths amounted to about 
twenty-two persons, all males, however. There was one female, I think, 
wounded accidentally but not seriously. The people who came to 
distress that little band or colony of "Mormons" seemed to shun the 
idea of killing women and children, and devoted their entire strength 
to the destruction of the men. Eighty-five years have passed since 
that massacre, and I would like very much to see a very well-marked 
stone at the place where the massacre occurred — not costly, but merely , 
a mark that will remain for future generations to see. 

I rejoice today in the testimonies which I have heard. I testify 
to you that the gospel is true. I know that God lives and that Jesus 
Christ is the Savior of the world. I know as well as I know that I 
live that Joseph Smith was indeed a prophet of God, and those 
brethren who have succeeded him, commencing with President Brigham 
Young, including President John Taylor, including President Wilford 
Woodruff, including President Lorenzo Snow, including President 
Joseph F. Smith, and now our beloved President Heber J. Grant, are 
men called to that high position which they occupied and do occupy, 
by the inspiration of the Spirit of God, and under the direction of 
that power and that Spirit, they have led and guided the people; and 
the conditions with which we are surrounded today proclaim to me 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



in the most satisfactory manner that the people generally, the majority 
of the Latter-day Saints, are striving with might, mind and strength, 
from the President down to the least and last member, to know the 
mind and will of the Lord and to keep his commandments. The 
prosperity which we experience today, the plenty with which we are 
surrounded, and the testimonies of the people who do not belong 
to the Church, all are convincing arguments to remind us that the 
Lord is blessing his people more abundantly today than ever before, 
and the testimonies of the brethren seem to be brighter and clearer 
than ever before, bringing to my mind and to my great satisfaction, 
that we are lovers of God more than lovers of pleasure, and that 
we are trying to fulfil the measure of those two great commandments 
given to us by .the Savior of the world : "Thou shalt love the Lord 
thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy 
mind * * * * and thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." 

I pray the Lord to bless the Latter-day Saints. Bless their 
labors and inspire them in the future as in the past. Give them joy 
in their labors, because of the earnestness of endeavor that the people 
are making to serve the Lord and keep his commandments. God 
bless the Presidency of the Church, and every responsible leader, 
and all the people, I pray, through Jesus Christ, our Lord, Amen. 

Announcements of the special Priesthood meeting to be held on 
Monday morning at 10 o'clock, also of the Sunday School conference 
to be held Sunday evening, the 6th, at 7 o'clock, were made. 

The choir sang, "The Inflammatus" with Dolores Seal as soloist. 

The closing prayer was given by Elder Jacob Hamblin of the St. 
Johns stake of Zion. 

FIRST OVERFLOW MEETING 

An. overflow meeting of the conference was held in the Assembly 
Hall at 10 a. m., April 6, 1924. Elder William A. Hyde, president of 
the Pocatello stake of Zion, presided. Music and singing were fur- 
nished by the Twenty-first ward choir under the direction of Walter 
A. Wallace, and Tracy Y. Cannon, organist. 

The choir and congregation sang, "How firm a foundation." 

The opening prayer was offered by Elder William C. Winder, of 
the High Council of Granite stake. 

The choir sang, "Ye simple souls who stray." 

ELDER WILLIAM A. HYDE 

(President of the Pocatello Stake of Zion) 

Perhaps a word of personal mention this morning would be ex- 
cusable. Under the rather unprecedented circumstances in which I 
am called to preside over this meeting, no doubt there are very many 



ELDER WILLIAM A. HYDE 99 

in the audience who are not acquainted with the presiding officer. 
I am William A. Hyde, of Pocatel'o. You have frequently heard of 
the town in Idaho, no doubt, and incidentally have heard of our con- 
nection as a stake with the Church ; for we are all more or less con- 
nected and acquainted with the history of the Church in its various 
departments and organizations. 

I am relieved of .some embarrassment this morning by the kind- 
ness of President Grant in asking that I should speak first. Other- 
wise, I should have been under the necessity of pushing myself forward 
into a place that otherwise I would not care to assume. I approach 
this duty and this opportunity with a great deal of pleasure, from the 
fact, that this honor has been given me, but nevertheless with ap- 
prehension that perhaps I may not be able to acquit myself with a 
degree of success that would be becoming. There are perhaps only 
two or three other presidents of stakes in the Church who are older in 
seniority than I am. I have now been 'laboring in the ministry, in 
this capacity, about twenty-five years, and, as I recall it, there are 
only two or three others who have been in the service longer. 

It would naturally be thought, I presume, and it would be the 
logic of the situation, that with service in the Church there should 
come a degree of wisdom and a degree of experience ; in fact, that is 
what the Church requires of its men and of its women and expects 
of them. I come to you today representing a part of the Church 
which has as deep an interest in the growth of the whole as perhaps 
any other part of the Church, and is keenly alive, I believe, to the 
necessities that lie before this great work, and alive to the ends of 
our heavenly Father, with respect to us. Never have I had the op- 
portunity thus of confronting an audience with this responsibility, but 
I feel that it is a part of my duty to turn my mind with full earnest- 
ness of purpose to make this meeting in harmony with the grand 
meetings of this conference and those which no doubt will ensue. 

There are experiences in the lives of all men, no doubt, that 
have made great impressions upon their minds. Some of them come 
to us early in life. I recall one now through which I passed in 
the early days of my ministry that has been of great value to me; 
in fact, has been one of the leading things that has happened in 
the course of my association with the Church. I remember that in 
company with one of my companions I started upon a long journey 
to go over the top of the mountain into an adjoining valley for the 
purpose of a certain investigation. Those of you who have lived 
in country districts and have made journeys of this character will 
well understand now what I am about to say. We began our journey 
up one of those long, apparently interminable trails that are char- 
acteristic of our mountains, passing the familiar grades and varieties 
of willows and brush until we came, at last, to the evidences that 
pointed to the fact that we were near the top of the mountain — 
the sparsely growing quaking aspen trees and other evidences showing 



100 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



that we were near the summit, when suddenly there came upon our 
view a most unlooked for landscape. It .seems that the Creator had 
in some way hollowed out a miniature amphitheatre in the tops 
of the hills, a howl, a round valley, the edges of it fringed with pine 
trees. In the bottom of this little valley was a little stream of water 
that percolated through a tiny meadow. There were no evidences of 
any habitation there except a small log house, with its accompanying 
outbuildings, around which could be seen a few of the ordinary cattle 
that men in farming communities usually have. 

As I saw this rather unusual landscape, the thought occurred 
to me, "What can this man see?" I learned subsequently that, at 
periodical times, he went over the rim of the valley down to the nearby 
station to get his mail, but otherwise he was shut out from the world ; 
he was in a way a recluse, he was what you might term a hermit. He 
lived his life alone in the tops of the mountains, surrounded only by 
his few stock and the other little evidences of life, and perhaps they 
had a small family. When he stood out at his door at night he could 
see only about half of the firmament. The stars that deck the sky 
for you and me who live upon the plain were not observable by him. 
Perhaps no more than one half of the course of the sun could he ever 
see, and the great throbbing world around and about him never was 
observed by him except upon isolated occasions. And I thought, 
"How like man in general, in his attitude toward life and education, 
and the things that are best in the world, is this man who is thus 
isolated in the top of the mountain !" 

And from that I drew a lesson which has been a valuable one all 
the days of my life. It has been a lesson that has taught me the 
value of a greater outlook and view of things, of a broader perspective 
of life, and of the things with which we are surrounded and which 
go to make up our present life and that eventually will make up our 
future existence. I have seen men worldly wise and all-sufficient 
in their own estimation, who, like this man, though unlike him in 
a way but like him in this, surrounded by their wall of self-sufficiency, 
so that they have not been able to look out upon the vast acts 
and purposes and opportunities of men but have been limited to their 
own narrow conclusions, based upon their self-sufficient philosophy, 
and I have thought, "How inadequate are these men for all work of 
life, how insufficient are they for the things that our Father in heaven 
requires of them." 

Upon the other hand I have seen men in humble situations 
who have stood upon the mountain top and from their elevated pin- 
nacle have viewed the varied course of events, and it seems to me some- 
times have been able to look clown to the great finale of things. I 
have thought with re'ation to this lesson that the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, from his outlook and from the standpoint from which he viewed 
matters, knew more about the planets, the firmament, the great heaven 



ELDER WILLIAM A. HYDE 



101 



of heavens than you and I know about the little potato patch that we 
cultivate in our back garden. 

And I have from it drawn many a lesson that has been of comfort 
and of value to me in my ministry among the people. I have drawn 
from it the lesson of the value of perspective, the ability to see and to 
place together things in their proper relations as to distance and as 
to size and as to importance. I have learned that one who from 
proper distances may view the scenes of events, to him the scars, the 
crudities of life, the things that wound and hurt, are lost in the 
general view, just as one looks down upon the valley from the top of 
one of these hills, where now there may be gullies and crude forma- 
tions of earth, and may see the plain one vast carpet, as of some 
vast Axminster rug spread out beneath the sun. Distance takes from 
us the sting and the hurt of things, and gives us a better view of the 
proper relation and quality of men and their actions. 

And from it I have drawn this conclusion, that we are too near 
to our men today to properly understand the fine motives that actuate 
them. I believe that one hundred years from now we may look back 
upon this time in which we are now living, and some historian may 
say with full confidence, and with just as much authority as any 
historian who has ever written, that in this day in which we now live 
certain men spoke and directed, under the inspiration of the Holy 
Ghost. Then from that distance we may see and recognize the pro- 
phetic word and the prophet, just as well as we now recognize the 
prophet of olden times. And men who stand in our midst today 
and who have stood among us, who by reason of our very nearness, 
and of our close association with them, have lost in a degree that 
certain sacredness of character which attaches to a prophet — that 
having been removed by time — we may classify them among the prophets 
of whom ancient history speaks. Even now at this time there is 
one enshrined just so in the minds of the Latter-day Saints. He is 
removed from us by a hundred years, or nearly so, and today he has 
assumed a new form and aspect in life and he has become to us just 
as surely and as certainly a prophet of the Lord as ever any man 
that lived to whom that title has been given. 

And so, let me assure you, my brethren and sisters, and especially 
my young friends who may be listening to me today, these men who 
now stand among us are invested with that authority that empowers 
them to speak the word of God and speak with just the same convincing- 
force as did any man who ever lived upon the earth who presumed 
to speak in the name of. our heavenly Father. And so I have learned 
from these things the value of perspective, the right way to look at 
things, the way to disassociate ourselves from the nearness of the 
present, and to' see men as if they were afar off, and under the 
influence that time always casts upon men. 

I have learned this also, the value of patience. Events fly so 
swiftly by us that they are not seen in their proper relation. We 



102 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



little understand the movement of time. It takes time to bring to 
pass the fruition of God's purposes. Not always are the combinations 
seen in a few years, in a generation even. Men and women plod out 
their slow lives in their menial duties, and in the offices and callings 
that come to mortality, sometimes fretting and sometimes wondering 
if God will never justify their sacrifices ; but lo, and behold, a gen- 
eration passes ; their sons follow them and their sons' sons stand in 
their stead ; and lo, the work of the Lord has been accomplished 
in the thing that they hitherto had undertaken! A pioneer goes into 
a far distant country. In travail, trouble, poverty and distress, he 
plows the ground, sows and reaps, and sees the fruitage gone year 
after year, perhaps, but finally the culmination comes, where a temple 
is reared upon the very place he first set his foot, and the land blossoms 
under the blessing of the Almighty. He was the beginning of it, the 
one who spread the way and who opened up the means for the ac- 
complishment of the thing that ultimately the Lord, onr heavenly 
Father, gave to him and to his succeeding generations. 

And so, I have learned the lessons of patience, and in my ministry 
I have occasion, time and again, to say to people, "We are like 
the waves of the sea ; now we are upon the crest of success, and again 
we are down in the troughs of the ocean ; have patience, my friends, 
the time will come when your bark will be lifted upon the crest 
again, and you will see out upon the broad expanse of waters." How 
applicable this lesson may be to those who are in distress, at the 
present day, I think we may well consider. 

We have been passing through times of intense commercial tra- 
vail and trouble. Many and many are the good men and good women 
who have been down in the very bottom of despondency, due to these 
unusual conditions through which we have passed. Nevertheless, by 
a proper understanding of God's purposes, and by a proper estimation 
of our strength, we may hold out firmly to the end, until these things 
shall have passed and prosperity shall again come to us. Thus I 
know that the Lord decrees that men shall have patience ; that they 
shall endure; that it is not his purpose that in any man or any gen- 
eration of men shall all things be culminated ; but that we, following 
one after another in the line of our activities and of oar peopling of 
the earth, constitute the grand whole of which God's plan is made. 
We today are contributing lo the success of tomorrow ; and, through- 
out the Church of Christ, there should run the element of patience 
and of faith, in the thought that eventually there will come success 
to all those who sincerely trust in him. and ■ patiently abide the day 
of his vindication. 

Speaking of the attitude which men assume and from which 
they may view, I had a rather unusual experience this morning that 
fits in nicely with the theme that I have undertaken. Coming down 
the street, I passed a man whom I have known for years, a poor 
old cripple, who must be now seventy-five years of age, who dragged 



ELDER WILLIAM A. HYDE 



103 



one foot slowly behind the other, in evident pain as he traveled, 
but nevertheless with a contented look upon, his face, (his good 
old wife with her arm in his, helping him along the .sidewalk. And 
just after I had bade them good morning, and had passed my saluta- 
tion with him as an old friend whom I had known formerly in the 
stake over which I preside, he called to me and said, "Brother Hyde, 
do you know about my genealogy?" Why no, I did not know 
about it. Said he, "We have the names of ten thousand people, and 
we have done the work for four thousand of them." And then there 
was a happy look of anticipation upon his face. I thought I could 
see the unuttered thought in his mind, "What a joy and pleasure it will 
be to do the work for the other six thousand of them." And, as 
I turned from him, I thought, "This man with his dragging foot, 
drawn in pain along the sidewalk, is far above the ordinary man, 
he is lifted upon the wings of the spirit, that has taken him above 
the mountain top. He looks down upon us, I think, from his lofty 
station, perhaps with a degree of pity — upon those who do not see 
as he does." And I thought, "How glorious is this work of the Latter- 
day Saints! How superior their thought, in a way, to the wisdom of 
men ! How broad and expansive are their conceptions of the almighty 
purposes of our heavenly Father ! They are not recluses ; they are 
not hermits; from the standpoint to which God has led them by 
his revelations, they look forth upon the work which comprises and 
embraces not only the scheme of mortality, but all the vast concourse 
of the sons of men from the beginning of time." 

And so, my brethren and sisters, let us take these lessons from 
these observations which you, no doubt, have seen as I have seen 
and recounted, to have patience, and faith, and to seek to come out 
from the narrow limits of our own self-sufficiency, to emerge from 
that species of confidence which sometimes comes to the Latter-day 
Saint and makes him think that he and his people are all there are 
who are associated in the work of the Lord. I like to take the broader 
view, that God, through men, is working out his purposes, and that 
he is bringing to pass, from all directions and from all sources, the 
things that will contribute to the glory of his name; and that in- 
ventois, poets, and workers in all lines of thought are doing perhaps 
unconsciously the very thing that God would have them do. So, 
with faith thus pitched and attuned to the purposes of the Almighty, 
let us go forward with full purpose of heart, to serve him and keep 
the commandments, in faith, believing, and with vision seeing the 
wonderful things that God has in store for his,people. 

May his Spirit be in the minds and hearts of the Latter-day Saints 
and spur them on to renewed activity and faith in this great and 
glorious work which has been given to us to accomplish in these the 
last days. This is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ELDER SAMUEL O. BENNION 

(President of the Central States Mission) 

I sincerely trust, my brethren and sisters, that I may be led to 
say what, the Lord would have me say on this occasion, that our 
meeting here together may be beneficial unto all, that we may go 
home and feel that this part of our conference was in harmony with 
the preceding sessions. I have been greatly encouraged in my faith 
through the sessions of the conference this year and by the splendid 
instruction given by those who preside over us and by the other 
speakers, who have taught the principles of the gospel pertaining to 
life and salvation. I think I have never been more impressed with 
the greatness of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
Men and women are gathered from great distances to this conference, 
from many states of the United States, and also from Canada and 
Mexico, and are come here to receive instruction concerning the 
work of the Lord, to confer with one another, and to receive counsel, 
advice, and inspiration so necessary in carrying on the work of our 
Father in the different places where they have been called upon to 
take positions of trust. The great majority of people who have 
gathered here are men and women who have been called upon to 
represent the Lord in their own home or section, and it is a very 
representative body, and the body of representatives are reinforced 
by members of their own home town and ward and stake, who have 
come here to aid and assist them, so that the work of God may con- 
tinue to grow. There is absolutely no question as to the success of 
the work of God under such splendid organization. It could not be 
duplicated in all the world. There is no organization to compare 
with the restored Church of Jesus Christ here in the earth. This 
is the Church of God, represented by his Priesthood, his power, here 
upon the earth, and it is a medium by which men and women may 
return unto him. And those who fail to accept or who reject the 
glad message which the Lord has revealed, shall not have the hap- 
piness that comes to those who shall inherit a glory wherein he 
rules and reigns. 

We find scripture to give us encouragement both at home and 
abroad. A few years ago, when I went into the mission field, a 
gentleman was on the train with me, and the train was so crowded 
that we had to stand up from here to Provo. He was a stranger to 
me. for I had never seen him before, and did not even know who 
he was, but he told me to read, on reaching my mission field, the 84th 
section of the Doctrine and Covenants, and called my attention to 
some of the blessings which the Lord had placed at my disposal. He 
. pointed to the 65th verse, down to the 90th. I shall not read them 
all. He said, "When you get out there, and you are alone, and you 
find that you are far away from home, among strangers, in a strange 
land, without any experience, you will learn that the Lord has pro- 



ELDER SAMUEL O. BENNION 



vided for you, so that you shall not be alone, and you shall have 
his Spirit for your companion." And so I found the scripture as 
he had referred me to it: 

"Behold, I send you out to reprove the world of all their unrighteous 
deeds, and to teach them of a judgment which is to come. 

"And whoso receiveth you, there I will be also, for I will go before 
your face. I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall 
be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up." — 
(Verses 87-88.) 

My brethren and sisters, there was never anything more true than 
that promise which God gives to those who represent him. And with 
my experience in the mission field, I have concluded that these truths 
and promises not only apply to the mission field, but to men and 
women at home — those who are engaged in the work of the Lord, — - 
who labor in their weakness, with a determination to serve him. 
Nothing can be found in the world equal to it — where our Father, 
who gave us, his children, the privilege to come into the world, has 
said, when we go out in the world, if we will keep his commandments, 
as we have been taught them, and as President Grant reminded us 
yesterday morning, the Lord will be with us : "I will be on your 
right hand and on your left, and I will go before your face, and mine 
ange's shall be round about you, to bear you up." And he said further 
that any one who shall not fail to continue faithful in these things, 
"shall not be weary in body or in mind, neither in limb nor joint, and 
an hair of his head shall not fall to the ground unnoticed." 

I am, of course, as you are aware, more closely associated with 
men and women in the ministry, away from the stakes of Zicn. 
These words mean that the Lord is with the boys and girls 
of yours, with as much power as he ever was in the earth, and 
that they may possess the same faith their fathers and their grand- 
fathers possessed, even from the day of the Prophet Joseph Smith. Only 
this past winter we have had missionaries out in the field traveling 
without money ; walking through the country wherever their duties 
called them, among entire strangers, to places, where elders had not 
been for at least twenty years — and in twenty years' time a new 
population almost grows up in a country. They have been cared for 
night and day, never having to buy a meal, never having to pay 
for a bed, and the Lord has gone before their faces, his influence 
and his power with them, so that they were fed and cared for until 
they were under no expense at all. When you think that missionaries 
in our field have gone through the early part of this year, three 
months some of them, with an expense of only $5 per month, it is 
almost unbelievable. And it could not be done, anywhere in the world, 
except under the direction of Jesus Christ our Lord. It was he who 
died on Calvary for you and for me ; it was he who gave his life 
that we might live ; it was he who bought and paid for the human 
family with his blood. He is at the head, and he directs the forces

in the earth, and he gives men their privilege to accept him or to 
reject him. But he is there with those who desire to serve him 
and keep his commandments, and men can grow as close to our Father 
here in mortality today as they ever did in any time of the world's 
history. There never was greater organization in the earth than 
in this Church. It is most perfect. There is no need for a man or 
woman to be idle. They should be anxiously engaged in this great 
work of God, whether at home or abroad. 

And I might read to you some scripture that has been given 
unto us along that very line in these last days, for all scripture 
has been given unto us for our benefit. If we do not read it or 
become acquainted with it, we do not know or ever realize or under- 
stand the real joy and pleasure of putting our faith and trust in 
the Lord. 

The Lord says, "Verily I say, men should be anxiously en- 
gaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, 
and bring to pass much righteousness ; for the power is in them, wherein 
they are agents unto themselves. And inasmuch as men do good, 
they shall in no wise lose their reward." (D. & C. 58:27, 28.) 

There is the principle of free agency, which the Lord gives unto 
every one of his children when they come into the world. You can 
do as you please. We all learned many things before we came to the 
earth, as a result of our experience under the direction of our heavenly 
Father in that ante-mortal state, where our Father guided the destiny 
of all of us, according to our faithfulness there, and then gave unto 
us the privilege of coming into the world and receiving this power 
of free agency. And he says that we should be anxious concerning 
his work. 

Some missionaries go out into the field and travel free, and there 
is not anything that would hinder them from making a success. They 
have a desire to proclaim the gospel. They are not fearful of men. They 
are only fearful of their own weaknesses, and that is the normal condi- 
tion of a true missionary in this Church ; they do not fear men, but they 
fear the Lord, and they rely, and know they must rely, upon him for 
their success. But they go out and arrange meetings, and it is nothing 
unusual at all for boys in their teens to go and arrange meetings 
where they .speak, every night in the week. To me it. is a marvel and 
a wonder that they are able to do it. Congregations of people come 
and fill the little chapels or schoolhouses, wherever they may have 
the privilege of preaching. And many have been brought into this 
Church as a result of it. The opinions of thousands of people have 
been changed as a result of the ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ 
through the missionaries of the Church, in these the last days, and 
in my time, in this dispensation. 

If men are anxious concerning their work, how easy it is! If 
we will just make up our mind to do it, and we fail not to continue 
faithful in these things, the Lord will open up the way, provide for 



ELDER SAMUEL 0. BENNION 



107 



us, so that we can reach the people. And it is not difficult to change the 
opinions of men and women if we proceed in the way which the Lord 
has counseled. There is just as much power in prayer and in the 
faith that comes as a result of prayer today, as there was in the 
days of Abraham or preceding him or following hint. There never 
was any more power given unto men in the earth than at the present 
time. Missionaries have gone forth today as they did in the days of 
the Prophet Joseph, in the days Brigham Young, and in the days of 
John Taylor and all those mighty men who laid the foundation for 
this great work of God, of which we are enjoying so much the 
blessings at the present time. Missionaries are now being raised up 
from among the rank and file in all parts of the Church, who go 
out and test the gospel and the promises of the Lord, and have found 
faith in the earth, just as much as they did fifty, seventy-five, or 
more, years ago, even back unto the time of the Prophet Joseph 
Smith. The work is not failing; it is absolutely impossible for the 
work of God to fail. When I think of the care that is given to the 
details of this Church — I feel in my heart to say that in my experience 
I have never seen any person more careful over details than the 
present President of this Church, Heber J. Grant, who devotes his 
entire time to the work, I am reminded of the fact, that he 
is anxiously engaged in the great cause of the Lord ; he is commanded 
only of God, and he sets to the people the proper example, and as 
a result the work is becoming greater and more glorious. To me it 
is a marvel and a wonder. Men arise everywhere in defense of the 
Lord Jesus Christ. The people of the earth are anxiously waiting for 
the gospel. I do not blame people, in a way, for rejecting the testi- 
mony of men whom they do not know anything about. Men and 
women have to be melted. Why, this Church would not succeed at 
all if it were not for the fact that the people are called together in 
the ward once or twice or thrice a week by a careful, faithful bishop, 
and if those wards were not called together under direction of the stake 
presidency, who give all the care to details that they know how, 
and in addition to that the general authorities of the Church visit them 
and talk to them,! In addition to that, they are called together twice 
a year in great conference assembled, and they are there taught the 
principles of the everlasting gospel, as the Lord has revealed it, from 
those whom the Lord calls to speak, and as a result the Church moves 
forward in its great, mighty march and improvement as the years 
come and go, and among these men and women will be found the faith 
of Israel. Why, the faith of Israel will be greater next year than 
it is this. The Church will never be weaker than it is today, and it 
never was stronger than it is today. Men shall arise from among 
the wards and stakes of this Zion who shall make apostles of the Lord 
Jesus Christ, who shall be the ones who will build on the foundation 
that God revealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith, and they will carry 



108 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



on this work until we shall arrive at the time when the Christ shall 
come. 

There is absolutely no possibility of failure, neither is there any 
man who can disprove the work of the Lord. A man may say that 
Joseph Smith is not a prophet, or that the Book of Mormon is not 
true. He only tells what he thinks is the truth ; but a man who has 
not made an investigation of the Lord's work in this dispensation, 
who has not made it a matter of prayer and faith and been honest 
and square, that man is not a good judge. And if he were honest 
and true, he would have to say that he does believe Joseph Smith to 
be a prophet ; and the same argument would hold good with the Book 
of Mormon or the Doctrine and Covenants. It requires faith, at- 
tention, devotion, and the heart of a man, to know this word of God. 

Here we are in mortality, having been given our free agency to 
do as we would do, and if we ever come to a knowledge of the truth 
and walk through mortality under the divine guidance of that truth, 
we must be governed and controlled by the principle of faith and the 
principle of desire, and be anxious in our hearts concerning our life 
here in mortality. And so it is with men and women abroad, they 
have to come out of the conditions in which they are, slipping, strug- 
gling along, not knowing the true way of life. And my heart goes 
out to the children of men here in mortality. I have made it a 
point never to offend men or women. I have gone out of the way 
many times in my experience, just to make a friend. It is not 
anything to me at all, so far as a personal reward on earth is con- 
cerned, but it is to me, so far as the Church is concerned, my duty. 
Those people are not to blame. They have grown up as Methodists 
and Presbyterians and Baptists and Catholics, and they are firm in 
the belief of their fathers. They have faith in their fathers' work, 
and they are not to blame. We can afford to be charitable; as we 
plead for God, our eternal Father, to be charitable and kind unto us, 
so we must likewise be kind and charitable unto those among whom 
we are called upon to live and labor here in mortality. These prin- 
ciples should guide us every day. And Oh ! what a glorious oppor- 
tunity we have here in mortality to acquit ourselves like men and 
women, and to become as fountains of living water unto the children 
of men, among whom we labor. God is at the helm and directs the 
work. He will see that it does not fail. We may fail, but his 
work will not fail, because others will carry on the great work of 
God, until every man and every woman has had an opportunity, 
either here in mortality or in the spirit world, to hear and accept the 
truth. Then they may say, if they desire, it is true, or it is not true, 
according to their findings. - 

May the Lord give you and me the privilege of walking uprightly 
before him. May he encourage us, and may we live so that we may 
feel that encouraging life and spirit with us, and not be discouraged. 
May. we be anxious concerning his work, and of our own free will 



ELDER SAMUEL 0. BENNION

go on and develop the character that we brought to this world with 
us as a result of our experience with him. 

May we have the power to reject evil, may we always stand for 
the testimony of Jesus and for his authority in the earth. May we 
make .men and women strong who hold positions of trust in his great 
Church in the earth. May we respect the teacher and the ward 
auxiliary officer ; may we uphold the bishop as the father of the 
ward, and his counselors and his assistants, and these stake presi- 
dents and high councilors who preside in the different parts of the 
Church. May we uphold their authority as the authority of the Lord 
Jesus Christ. May we keep the principle of loyalty and love in our 
homes and in the Church at home. Then may we stand for God's author- 
ity here in this earth — President Heber J. Grant, whom the Lord chose 
and raised up to lead us in these clays, as you may all read and 
learn, because it is all recorded in the history of this Church how the 
Lord raised him up. And the Lord will raise others up. He has 
left us a history, a written history, a testimony in addition to that of 
man ; so that we may know the truth, so that we may know where 
we stand, and that we may not be deceived. May he give us the 
blessings of faith and hope and courage, that we may keep this work 
of his foremost in our minds always, I pray, in the name of Jesus 
Christ, Amen. 

ELDER JOSHUA H. PAUL 

(Of the University of Utah) 

One of the most remarkable fallacies of modern times was well 
stated a few years ago by the late Professor Huxley, the leader of 
advanced thought, whose views on scientific truth were perhaps more 
widely accepted than those of any other man of his day. In a 
lecture, first delivered in 1866, and extensively quoted ever since (as 
in Ayedelotte, English for Engineers, page 207), this great scientist 
says that the business of thinkers of the Middle Ages was to deduce, 
from data furnished by the theologians, conclusions that agreed with 
the decrees of the Church ; that to them nature had no fixed order ; 
"that when good authority has pronounced what is to be believed 
and faith has accepted it, reason has no further duty." He adds that 
many excellent people still hold these convictions, and goes on to argue 
that the improvement of natural knowledge is effected by methods 
that directly give the lie to all these convictions. Then he says : 
"The improver of natural knowledge absolutely refuses to acknowl- 
edge authority as such. For him skepticism is the highest of duties ; 
blind faith, the one unpardonable sin. The votary of science holds 
his firmest convictions, not because the men he most venerates hold 
them, not because they are verified by portents and wonders, but be- 
cause whenever he brings these convictions into contact with nature, 



110 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



nature verifies them. The man of science has learned to believe in 
"justification, not by faith, but by experiment." 

As far as I know, no very definite answer to the indictment 
which Huxley so shrewdly brought against the cardinal principle of 
religion has yet been made by the Christian world at large. If any 
such answer has been made, I shall be under great obligations to 
any one who will bring it to my attention. Yet it is well known 
among our own people that experiment has exactly the same function in 
religion that it has in scientific knowledge, and is the test, in fact, 
of religious as well as of all other forms of truth. When our parents 
walked across the plains, as so many thousands of them did, was this 
not an experiment? Did they not thereby put to the test these words 
of our Lord and Savior: "If any man shall do his will, [the Father's] 
he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God or whether I 
speak of myself." In other words, men are here bidden to make 
the experiment and to learn for themselves the truth. Real faith does 
not rest upon belief in authority. It is tested and confirmed by ex- 
periment — not by an experiment performed upon a table in a corner 
of a laboratory or under a microscope or in test tubes, but in the 
broad field of life and in such a way as to involve all the powers 
of man. True, it is not the result of doubt ; it rests first upon testimony 
given by others ; but so also does scientific knowledge. For the 
scientist hears of a theory or principle, and then proceeds to test it 
'by experiment. The believer hears the good news that God lives and 
has revealed himself to man, and he accepts the testimony. But he 
immediately proceeds to test it in many ways, just as the scientist 
pioceeds to test natural knowledge. The only difference between 
the two kinds of belief is that faith rests upon and is verified by 
spiritual experience, while scientific faith rests upon physical ex- 
perience. In both, the process of experiment is carried on ; in both, the 
words of others are at first to some extent relied upon ; and in 
both, subsequent experiments or experience will be necessary finally 
to prove or disprove what is accepted as probably true — the testimony 
of competent and trusted witnesses. The Latter-day Saints almost 
daily make the true answer to the criticisms of Mr. Huxley. They 
may not know that they are answering the skeptic when they make 
the claim that the all-important part of their religion is a testimony of 
the truth — a feeling of certitude that the gospel message is true. They 
say that every one may have this testimony, this feeling of certainty, 
if he will only live for it; if he will only take heaven at its word and 
do the will of the Father. We say it is the most important thing in 
life to lay hold of. It is not a theory, not a theological definition, 
not a dictum from the dark ages, but something to work at with your 
hands, not an abstraction ; something to live for, something for which 
to aspire, something to be learned and re-learned, something old but 
ever new. 

When, therefore, my mother, like many of yours in this audience, 
walked across the plains to come to Zion, — was this a theory, a de- 



ELDER JOSHUA H. PAUL 



111 



finition, a blind following of those in authority? Or was it not an 
experiment of great magnitude and reality? Not all, of course, in 
order to test the promises of the Almighty, can undergo such an ex- 
perience as crossing the plains afoot, but there are universal tests — 
tests for every one — tests that no one can avoid — experiences or ex- 
periments that are arranged for all of us irrespective of our own 
choosing; and these commonly bring us to our senses, till we come to 
realize, even in our misfortunes, that God lives and all i,s well. For 
example : when a boy, I learned from my Wilson Reader a poem, 
"The Little Boy that Died ;" but not till I was grown and had the 
same experience that the author had, did I understand the meaning of 
his verses. Now his verse seems to me to go far toward proving that 
we shall meet them again — all whom we have loved and lost. So 
when the Lady Lucile of our household died, we were ready only 
then to understand the scripture that she is not dead, not asleep, not 
gone. She is only in the presence of our Father, and he is with us, 
if we abide in him. Rossiter Raymond thus brought these truths to our 
attention : 

"Beside the dead I knelt in prayer, 

And felt a presence as I prayed; 
Lo! it was Jesus standing there. 

He smiled, 'Be not afraid.' 

" 'Lord, thou hast conquered death, we know; 

Restore again to life,' I said, 
'This one who died an hour ago.' 

He smiled, 'She is not dead.' 

" 'Asleep, then, as thyself didst say, 

Yet thou canst lift the lids that keep 
Her prisoned eyes from ours away.' 

He smiled, 'She doth not sleep.' 

" 'Nay, then, though haply she doth wake 

And look upon some fairer dawn, 
Restore her to our hearts that ache.' 

He smiled, 'She is not gone.' 

" 'Yea, Lord we feel that she is free, 

And moves upon some higher sphere; 
We are bereft; she is with thee.' 

He smiled, 'And I am here!' 

"'Dear God! how can we know that they 

Still walk unseen with us and thee, 
Nor sleep, nor wander far away?' 

He smiled, 'Abide in me.' " 

If we perforin the great experiment, if we abide in him, we 
shall know for ourselves, and shall find our peace in the gospel truth. 
All shall be clear, he tells us, if we put the matter to the test by doing 
the will of the Father. And that we may do so is my prayer in behal f 
of one and all.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ELDER JUNIUS F. WELLS 

(Assistant Church Historian) 

My brethren and sisters. The thought has occurred to me that 
I am standing about where President Jedediah M. Grant stood seventy 
years ago speaking at the April Conference. I am not telling of some- 
thing that I know for myself, because I was not bom then; but, as 
an historian, I suppose it is right to remember some things that are 
written. Upon the site of this building there then stood the old adobe 
tabernacle. It was placed lengthwise, north and south, about 130 feet 
and was 65 feet 'wide. On the western side there was a vestry, which 
had an entrance through the west wall of the temple block. The 
Presidency of the Church and the Twelve would come in and meet 
first in that vestry. Rising from it there was the stand, facing the 
congregation, which was seated facing west; the two broad entrance 
doors were on the east side of the building. It was soon found that, 
on account of the length being the other way, the people seated 
north and south of the stand could not hear, consequently the arrange- 
ment was changed and the stand was placed in the north end of the 
building. The choir was in the south end. The o'id organ, ten or 
twelve feet square, I remember very well. Charley More used to blow 
the bellows and we boys would get up there and help him blow. 

Upon the occasion that I am referring to, seventy years ago, 
President Jedediah M. Grant discoursed upon the fulfilment of proph- 
ecy, and especially with respect to the wars that were at that time 
afflicting the world. The Crimean War was then on. lie said: 

"Can the wise men of Europe tell the result of the present war be- 
tween Russia and Turkey and the allied powers? No. they cannot. If the 
present war should he suspended for a time, can they tell when the next 
war will break out and what will be the result of it? No, they cannot. 
But if you will listen to the revelations of God through the spirit of 
prophecy, and to the servants of God, you may learn it all with certainty." 

It was then, as it has been since the Great World War, quite the 
fashion to proclaim peace just as war between striving nations was 
about to break out and, again, as it would approach its close, to sav 
there never could be another. Great philosophers, great men of 
thought, and statesmen at that time were proclaiming peace, and 
since then. — Why, do you know, some of our most eminent Americans, 
within a year of the outbreak of the Great World War, having 
traversed Europe from one end to another, proclaimed from public 
stands and issued written nroclamations of the impossibility of an- 
other war.! — Jedediah M. Grant did not take that view with respect 
to war in his day nor in this day and age of the world. He made 
this remark: The God of heaven, or as he expressed it, "The Gods 
in yonder heavens have something to do with the^e mighty revo- 
lutions and warlike convulsions, which shake creation almost to its 



ELDER JUNIUS F. WELLS 



113 



center." And in effect he added; This world is destined to be 
drenched in war, and these nations that are proud are destined to 
be brought down to destruction and obliteration through war : 

"Though the fulfilment of the words of the prophets is clear and 
visible to us as the noonday sun in its splendor, yet the people of the 
world are blinded thereto; they do not comprehend nor discern the hand 
of the Lord * * * W.e see it in the revolutions of our own continent: 
we see it in the scattering of the house of Israel; in the fading away of 
nations (Indian) on the right and on the left; in the present commotion 
in our own nation; in the broils and contentions between the South and 
the North; in short, we see it in all the events connected with our own 
and other nations living on the continent of North and South America. 
And when the mind's eye stretches abroad, across the mighty deep, through- 
out Europe we see the hand of the Lord visible at work there; not only 
in the spread of the Gospel, in the prosperity of the people of God, and 
in the proclamation of the eternal principles of truth, through the agency 
of the elders of Israel, but in the war-clouds gathering black around, 
dyeing the ocean with human gore and drenching the solid earth with 
blood." 

Remember this was spoken in the year 1854. Well, just to recall 
a few wars that have transpired since President Jedediah M. Grant 
spoke upon that theme. Following the Crimean War (1854-1856) 
there came the Great American Civil War (1861-1865). President 
Grant alluded to that and the evidence of such a strife already before 
the people. He supported the prophecies of Joseph Smith the Prophet 
(December 25. 1832 and April 1843) in which he said: 

"Three days before the prophet Joseph started to Carthage I well 
remember his telling us we should see the fulfilment of the words of 
Jesus upon the earth, where he says the father should be against the son, 
and the son against the father, the mother against the daughter, etc. 
The Prophet stood in his own home when he told several of us of the 
night the visions of heaven were opened to him, in which he saw the 
American continent drenched in blood; and he saw nation rising up against 
nation; for he saw that the spirit of God should he withdrawn from the 
inhabitants of the earth, in consequence of which, there should be blood 
upon the face of the whole earth, except among the people of the Most 
High. The prophet gazed upon the scene his vision presented until his 
heart sickened, and he besought the Lord to close it up again." 

After the Civil War there was the great Franco-German War 
of 1870-1871 ; a war which left the burning feelings of war, with the 
determination that there should be another war. It has had its ex- 
pression in this great World War of the present time. "Revenge!" 
the French cried, having been defeated by the Germans at that time. 
Now, they have had their revenge. 

Then there was the great Turco-Russian War, (1876-1877) fought 
with the utmost bitterness and the destruction of many thousands. 
And then there was the Spanish-American War (1898), in which we 
had a conflict with Spain and obtained the Philippines ; released 
Cuba from Spanish control and drove out from this continent of 
America, from this land of Zion, the last kingly authority — "The 
destruction of Kingdoms!" 



114 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Then there was the British-Boer War in South Africa (1900- 
1901), most destructive; then the Russian- Japanese War (1904-1905) 
in which other tens of thousands were brought down. Then at length 
there came the Great World War, (1914-1918). 

The spirit of war is still in the world, my brethren and sisters. 
It is not finished. Many predictions of the prophets have yet to be 
fulfilled. The world that has forgotten God ; the nations that do not 
know him ; the churches that use his name in vain, not having authority ; 
nor the inspiration of his spirit, nor the knowledge and testimony 
of his design and purpose, may proclaim peace and talk peace and 
form peace congresses, but in vain ; enduring peace is far from this 
world of contention and strife, As a result of the Great World 
War, what do we witness? Is there greater unity? Is there greater 
love? Is there a greater confidence? Is there greater trust? The 
world has never seen a time when there is so much distrust among 
the people ; when there is such utter lack of confidence in leaders — 
every nation seeking, for the men, or feeling the need of men, that 
are fit to lead, who can speak with authority and command the con- 
fidence and the love and the trust of their fellowmen. But it is hard 
to find them. Where are the great mighty kingdoms and empires 
that were thought to be indestructible only ten years ago ; the great 
German empire, the great Austro-Hungarian empire, the great Russian 
empire, the great Turkish empire? -Gone! And it is the destiny of 
mankind to see further destruction, because the spirit of peace, the 
spirit of unity, the spirit of God, which alone can bring the people 
to peace, is not found in the world. They have rejected the prophets. 
Most of the nations have had the opportunity to receive, in this 
dispensation of the fulness of times, the testimony of the servants of 
God. They have turned their backs upon that testimony and despised 
it, and God will hold them responsible for it. This testimony has 
not only been carried to the nations of the earth, calling upon the 
poor and the humble to receive the truth, and to which many of 
the blood of Israel have responded ; it has been published in almost 
every land, and the opportunity to receive the truth has been pre- 
sented generally to mankind. A few have accepted it, and rejoice 
in it. The testimony has not only been to believers, but the testi- 
mony that binds the judgment of God, and looses the power of 
destruction upon them righteously, has also been borne to unbelievers 
with the same fidelity; so that God's justice, respecting the nations, 
may not be doubted even in the wars, the calamities, the pestilences, 
the famines, the widespread destruction that we are bound to witness 
and that we are witnessing, in this world of conflicting, unbelieving 
mankind, at the present day. 

I did not think I was going to speak upon this subject, for 
there was something else that I thought to speak upon which is far 
pleasanter from one point of view. Nevertheless, I am not one of the 
pacifists, who believe that this world is ready for peace. I see peace 



ELDER -JUNIUS F. WELLS

only through the fulfilment of the judgments of God, which are 
decreed upon the world in which we live, because of the unbelief of 
the world. All the children of men are called upon to believe in God 
the Father and in Jesus Christ his Son ; in the authority of the Holy 
Priesthood, in the manifestation and power of the Holy Spirit. They 
are called upon to recognize the fact that God himself has appeared 
and spoken to his children and is in the world, though the world 
knows it not. We are called to maintain the truth that the Prophet 
Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum were martyrs to the truth, 
whose blood has been spilled unrighteously, to .seal the testimony of 
God upon the world that is responsible for it. We have no other 
business, we Latter-day Saints, than to proclaim these truths, with 
all the power, means and influence the Lord gives us; to declare to 
mankind that the judgment day is at hand and is now upon the 
world. John the Revelator foresaw the time in which we live — 
foresaw the time when the angels of heaven, flying in the midst of 
heaven, should bring the everlasting gospel to preach to them that 
dwell upon the earth, crying with a loud voice, "Fear God and give 
glory to him, for the hour of his judgment is come and worship him 
that made heaven and earth and the sea and fountains of waters." 
Do we Latter-day Saints know that the revelation given John upon the 
Isle of Patmos is fulfilled, or is being fulfilled? We most assuredly 
do. And we declare to our fellowmen that this gospel which has 
been revealed through the Prophet Joseph Smith is a gospel of 
revelation ; is a gospel of the ministering of angels ; is a gospel of 
the demonstration and exercise of the power of God in the hands 
of his Priesthood, and that it must be recognized ; that it must be 
accepted. It is bound to make its way, until the honest in heart, the 
humble, the pure, the true, out of all nations, who are of the house 
of Israel, shall come to the knowledge of the truth and to rejoice 
in the testimony of Jesus Christ. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, our fathers, the associates of Joseph 
Smith, became converted through this kind of preaching. The elders 
that were called upon in the beginning, and Joseph himself, had that 
duty — undesirable in a way — to perform, that unthankful task to 
perform. The very first message Joseph had to deliver was to the 
leaders of religion, telling them that they were all wrong ; that they 
were corrupt; that they had a form of godliness but denied the power 
thereof ; that they had not the right and authority to teach the people. 
He maintained that a vision of heavenly quality, even the appear- 
ance of -the Father and the Son, had raised him up and caused him 
to deliver that message. He knew he had seen the vision; he knew 
that he had heard the voice of God ; he could not deny it. He 
wondered that the leaders of religion should not have taken him, 
a mere boy, a youth, and tried to persuade him that he was in error, 
if he were. Instead of that, they arose in opposition; they called 
him an imposter, and began to persecute him ; hounding him through-

out his life and ultimately to a martyr's death. That was the only 
argument they brought against him — persecution. 

Wicked warfare has been made against the Latter-day Saints 
and the testimony which they have borne to the world ; not arguments, 
nor .sound reasoning, not offering something that was better than that 
which the Saints have freely given to mankind; but abuse and per- 
secution. They have nothing else to offer. They have not that which 
is better, I wish to say this to the young people, descendants of parents 
who received the gospel in the early days. And how did they receive 
it ? They received it as a voice from heaven. Talk about argument, 
reasoning, discussion, investigation, and experiment ! Why, my brethren 
and sisters, tens of thousands of Latter-day Saints received the testi- 
mony of Joseph Smith, as the revelation of God to them, and 
the testimonies of the apostles and elders that were raised up by 
him, who went as early as 1837, to Europe, and were sent all over 
the world between that time and 1860. They received the testimony 
of these servants of God, who called upon them and all men to repent 
of their sins ; to believe that God lives and has spoken from the heavens, 
and that Jesus Christ lives ; that he has organized his Church upon 
the earth and established his kingdom among men; that he calls 
upon mankind to repent, offering them remission of their sins and 
that they should be forgiven ; that they should receive the gift of 
the Holy Ghost, which should bear witness that they were in accord 
with God and were in possession of the truth, and in fellowship 
with him and with one another, in bonds of eternal righteousness. 
That was the burden of their testimony. That is what the converts 
received through their ministry. 

How long did it take to convert them? Heber C. Kimball went 
into Chatburn, Lancashire, where they said he would be mobbed and 
not permitted to speak. He stood in the market place one evening 
at six o'clock, and began to speak to the people in this manner, pro- 
claiming the fact that he was a servant of God, an apostle of the 
Lord Jesus Christ. He called upon the people to repent of their 
sins, and he melted their hearts ; so that, with tears in their eyes they 
came up to him at that meeting, the first they had ever seen of him, and 
one said, "Will you please baptize me?" "And me?" "And me?" "And 
me?" Twenty-five that night before midnight he baptized, and in the 
morning twenty-six more. No more faithful Latter-day Saints ever 
lived than those who responded to that kind of testimony. He and 
others bore witness to them by the Spirit and power of God, exercising 
and manifesting the power of the Holy Priesthood, as apostles of 
Jesus Christ, who spoke as men having authority, because they pos- 
sessed it. 

Now, my brethren and .sisters, that authority was restored through 
the ministering of angels. Through the revelations of the Lord this 
Church has been established with its organizations and ordinances. 
This testimony is before the world. They cannot escape it, and it

will bind them and be sealed upon them ; to the salvation of all who 
believe and will accept it; and, as inevitably, to the destruction, 
righteously, of those who reject it. President Jedediah M. Grant 
spoke of the wonderful progress that had been made in tho.se seven 
years, from the time of the arrival of the Pioneers, when he led the 
third company of Saints across the plains in 1847. The progress 
that had teen made in seven years was simply astonishing. The 
old tabernacle, then new, which they met in, would hold as many as 
this Assembly Hall does. It was so crowded, at the following con- 
ference in the spring, they decided to build a bowery, which would 
seat seven thousand. It was located at the north end of the tabernacle. 
I remember the old bowery very well. I remember the old tabernacle 
and attending meetings there with my mother. President Grant not 
only referred to the material progress which had been made, and to 
the wonderful advancement beginning already to triumph over the 
sterility of these arid valleys ; but to the gathering of the people by 
tens of thousands; for they were coming, in thousands then. Do you 
know that, two years before the date of this discourse, in 1852, there 
were more Latter-day Saints in Great Britain than in Utah ? The 
largest number of our converts at one time were members of the 
Church in Great Britain — as I recall it, thirty-three thousand. As 
many as four or five or even six thousand emigrated in one season; 
they tried to bring, and I think they nearly accomplished it — one 
year, between 1853 and 1860, ten thousand souls across the plains, 
mostly from Europe. 

President Grant proclaimed with power that there was nothing 
that could hinder the progress of this work, or that could stay tht 
hand of the Almighty; that God was in the wars of the world, and that 
God was in the prosperity of his people ; that it was his work, and that 
we are his servants and that there was no power that could prevent 
the onward progress of this Church. I wonder how Jedediah M. 
Grant would now feel and how he would view the situation today ! 
His youngest son here in the Great Tabernacle, presiding over this 
great conference and Church, over these tens of thousands, aye, hun- 
dreds of thousands of faithful Saints ; all bearing witness to the ful- 
filment of his father's prophecy, delivered, within thirty feet of 
where I am standing, seventy years ago ! 

May God bless you, my brethren and sisters. Let us realize and ap- 
preciate the inheritance from our forbears. No more faithful men, no 
truer men and women ever lived ; none who lived nearer to God, who 
understood the whisperings of his Spirit and were willing to give their 
lives and all things they possessed for the establishment of this work, 
which we now are upholding. We have only still to bear their testi- 
mony ; to proclaim the truth which they proclaimed ; to stand for it ; 
and to ,see that it is carried to the ends of the earth ; to the conversion 
of the honest in heart and to the conviction of those that still rebel 
and will not receive the word of God. There are many in the world 



118 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



who will not believe that God is, although he has appeared and spoken ; 
who will not receive his word and acknowledge the ministry of his 
Priesthood. What can be their excuse? Where is their refuge? The 
condemnation of the world is unbelief. How can there be permanent 
peace between the nations or among the people in unbelief? It is not 
possible. Such peace can come to mankind only in a unity of belief, 
in one God, in one faith and in one baptism. There is only safety 
in accepting the truth. The truth is that God our Creator, the Father 
of us all is in the world. His children do not know it. It is your 
business, Latter-day Saints to proclaim it; it is my business to pro- 
claim it, and to manifest it in our lives, in such a way that our fellow 
creatures will take heed and notice and try to get in accord with 
the design and purpose of the Almighty ; instead of trying to find 
some other way, in opposition to it. 

May God help us to do this, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, 
Amen. 

The choir sang, "Forever worthy." 

The closing prayer was offered by Elder D. R. Lyon, Bishop of 
Ensign ward. 

SECOND OVERFLOW MEETING 

A second overflow meeting was held in the Assembly Hall at 2 
o'clock, April 6, 1924. Elder Edward H. Snow, president of the St. 
George stake of Zion, presided. As in the morning session, the Twenty- 
first ward choir, Walter A. Wallace, conductor, furnished the music ; 
with Tracy Y. Cannon, organist. 

The choir sang, "Come let us anew, our journey pursue." 

The opening prayer was offered by Elder Joseph B. Smith of 
the High Council of Ensign stake. 

The choir, accompanied by an orchestra, sang the cantata, 
"The Landing of the Pilgrims," with Elder William F. Bennett sing- 
ing the bass solo. 

ELDER EDWARD H. SNOW 

(President of St. George Stake of Zion) 

As it will be appropriate for me to announce the .speakers to 
you this afternoon, perhaps I would do well to begin with myself, 
by announcing to you that I am Edward H. Snow, President of the 
St George Stake of Zion. 

The announcement of that to you has a tendency to fasten upon 
my mind the sense of my responsibility. It is said that every bird 
sings sweetest in its native forest, and I am quite sure that I am much 
more at home among my own people, where I am known, than I am 
standing here today. Yet I do not have in my heart any fear for you 



ELDER EDWARD H. SNOW 119 



or of you, but only the fear of God, which I have always remembered, 
that I may not be ab!e to do full justice to the great cause which he has 
established on the earth and in which 1 am called upon, in a measure, 
to form a part. I am always inspired in my attendance upon these 
conferences, and I never stand up with the brethren in the opening 
hymn of our conferences, when I look around and see the immense 
congregation joining in the hymn, but I feel a sense of comradship, 
of common cause, of inspiration, and of loyalty to the great work of 
the Lord. I am always thankful too that I was born and reared in 
the Church, thankful for its environment, for the influence which the 
gospel has had upon my life, for the high ideals that have ever been 
expounded by the leaders of the Church, for the safeguards which they 
have thrown around us. While giving us full free agency, they have 
magnified the good, the noble, the pure, and the true, and they have 
not left us in doubt as to the course that we ought to pursue, if we 
jdesire happiness here on the earth. 

Happiness does not come to us as a result of prosperity or of riches, 
but from the consciousness of our doing the duty that lies nearest to 
us, well and faithfully, which means, substantially, following the work, 
life, and examples of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ in spending our 
time, talents and efforts for the good of his children. Thereby do ye 
manifest our love for God, our faith in him and in the ultimate triumph 
of his cause here on earth. The other morning, when we stood up to 
sing, I thought of the remark of Patrick Henry in the House of Bur- 
gesses, when the great cause of human freedom was hanging in the 
balance and when the foremost thought among the colonists was declara- 
tion of independence from Great Britian. He made, as you know, this 
memorable declaration, that three million people, armed in the holy 
cause of freedom, were invincible. Well, we do not reach that number, 
yet the cause that we represent in the earth, and which we have taken 
upon our shoulders to forward in the earth, is just as great, or perhaps 
greater than that which the colonists espoused ; and, though we be few 
in number, yet it is my sublime faith that united and harmonious as 
we are today and have ever been, we will be invincible in the earth, 
and that this work will continue to grow and increase in power and in 
influence and prestige among the people of the earth, and the virtue 
which the gospel inculcates, and which we exemplify in our lives, will 
be the saving grace of nations and kingdoms and thrones, and we will 
be a power in the land. Those who stand for truth and righteousness 
will look to us as an ally in the great cause of human redemption, and 
the holding together of our inheritance and our civilization. 

I am thankful for the strength which we feel in being clean. I 
am thankful for the personal cleanliness that exists in the Church, and 
the high ideals that we have of it, and that there is such a vast 
majority of the people who form the membership of this Church whose 
skirts are free from contamination with the sins of the world. Thereby 
will we have our strength. Thereby will we keep our faith, inspiration,

ELDER JOHN A. ELI SON

were not asked to remain among friends and loved ones, but the Lord 
said to this man, "Go out into the wilderness and I will lead you whither 
ye shall go." As I recall some of the incidents connected with this 
most wonderful trip : after a few years travel and experience, Nephi, 
the son of Lehi, and the younger son at the time, assumed the reins 
of government among his people and, in fact, did so legitimately; yet 
in the eyes of his older brethren he assumed this position much to their 
dissatisfaction. They complained of him, but nevertheless he performed 
his part. On one occasion only, I believe, was this young man ever 
deprived of at least a few friends to console, encourage, and help him, 
during his administration among the people. On one occasion not 
only did Laman and Lemuel complain, not only his mother, but even 
his father complained, when Nephi was unable, because of the breaking 
of his bow, to provide food for them. He was bound upon the ship ; 
he was persecuted by his own loved ones, yet he never faltered. And 
I believe that one of the chief reasons for it was that early in life he 
obtained a testimony of the divinity of the work of the Lord. 

You recall that when he returned to Jerusalem to obtain the plates 
his brethren severely criticized him and abused him, and finally 
it became necessary for an angel of the Lord to appear and rebuke 
them for their deeds. Now, this was a difficult experience, it is true, 
but at the same time Nephi obtained a testimony that the Lord lives. 
He learned that there were angels in heaven, who administered to mortal 
men upon the earth. And he was enriching his life with a testimony 
of the gospel, although he was undergoing great persecution. By 
referring back you will see that this was also true to Joseph who was 
sold into Egypt. He became the interpreter of dreams, he became a 
mouthpiece to those people in Egypt ; yet he was but a boy. 

In this dispensation we find a like character, to my mind, starting 
out to find the truth. He read the scriptures in James, that if any of 
you lack wisdom let him ask of God. This boy put it to the test, 
a thing, by the way, the we are all invited to do, and he also learned 
in the beginning of his life's mission that there were not only angels 
in heaven, but that God the Father and Jesus the Son, whom these 
very scriptures in which he was reading testified of, exist. By a 
visible view of them, he learned that they lived. And early in his life 
he said to a minister of religion, so-called, that he had seen the Father. 
Then to his own friends, and particularly to himself, he said, I cannot 
deny it ; I know that I have seen God and his Son, and the Lord 
knows that I know it; I am conscious of it. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, the question may be asked by 
those not of our faith, "What has this to do with this great latter-day 
work? What has this to do with 'Mormonism?' And whence do you 
derive your name? My brethren and sisters, as I see it, it has this 
much to do with it. It is only another epoch in which the Lord has 
made himself manifest to the children of men. He did it to these other 
youths ; he assisted them, he gave them strength to carry on their work, 



122 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



And it seems to me it is a source of great encouragement to the 
youth of Zion to learn as much- in detail as possible the history of 
these three young men. They have been a source of inspiration to me ; 
they have strengthened me in time of trouble ; they have been a means of 
causing me to investigate the truth and to gain hope and courage 
in furthering the work of the Lord. And .so, when I hear these songs 
sung, my heart rejoices and T feel to praise the Lord for the lives 
of these young men: 

"Praise to the man who communed with Jehovah! 
Jesus annointed 'that Prophet and Seer' — 
Messed to open the last dispensation; 
Kings shall extol him, and nations revere." 

My brethren and sisters, this ought to be inspiring to us. 
We have sting for a long time the words given in the days of 
the Savior: 

"Far, far away, on Judea's plains, 

Shepherds of old heard the joyous strains: 

Glory to God, glory to God, glory to God in the highest." 

And they, too, have inspiration in them. But I love to connect up 
these things, bring them together as an evidence that the Lord is work- 
ing with his children and particularly to bring it to bear upon our 
existence and work at the present time. A writer of our day has 
composed a song in which he vividly portrays a condition that existed 
when Joseph went out to pray. He describes the morning : 

"O how lovely was the morning! 
Radiant beamed the sun above, 
Bees were humming, sweet birds singing, 
Music ringing through the grove, 
When within the shady woodland, 
Joseph sought the God of love." 

I ask you, my brethren and sisters, to read that song : in the 
closing of the song, instead of saying, "Joseph sought the God of love," 
he said, 

"Joseph saw the God of love." 

I am grateful, my brethren and .sisters, for the privilege of 
living in this dispensation. I am grateful for the lives of these 
men. I cannot step forth on these grounds in front of those pieces 
of statuary that we have here of Joseph and Hyrum without feeling that 
my life is enriched thereby ; because those men, those boys, as they 
were, did for humanity and particularly for all those who accepted 
the message of life and salvation, that which is beyond price. 

I recall when going into the mission field a few years ago that 
it had been customary, apparently, from the council that we received 
from our mission president, for a good many elders to teach only 
faith in God, repentance, and baptism, etc., and that the bearing wit- 
ness that the work of the Lord is re-established, that an angel has 



ELDER JOHN A. EL1S0N 



123 



come to earth, seemingly was held in the background; and I recalled 
that Brother James G. Duffin, who was our president at that time, 
said, "Brethren, I want you to go out an testify that the Lord has 
sent an angel to earth, that he sent him to Joseph Smith, the Prophet, 
and that message we are now bearing to the children of men." My com- 
panion and I did that. We went form city to city, from community to com- 
munity ; we held cottage meetings on every hand, and in every instance 
we found that by bearing testimony to the fact that God had sent an 
angel to earth to Joseph the Prophet, we obtained and secured friends 
everywhere, that people were interested in our message. And to me 
the greatest satisfaction came in the fact that it strengthened and 
built up my testimony. And I bear my testimony here, 
brethren and sisters, to the effect that, while I claim not particular 
miraculous manifestations, little by little faith has come to me by 
doing the works, and I can truthfully say today that I know nothing 
else of this work but truth. I cannot conceive of its being anything but 
truth. I have not in me any conception of anything else that I desire 
in preference to the work of the Lord that we are engaged in as a 
people. My brethren and- sisters, to me it i.s the truth, and it is all 
the truth, and it is the means, it is the way, by which the children of men 
will get back to God, and in no other way. May his Spirit be with 
us. May it be carried to the children of men everywhere, that those 
who know us not and know not the truth may hear and accept this 
glad message and be saved and celestialized in the kingdom of God, 
I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER JOHN A. BECKSTRAND 

(President of Millard Stake of Zion) 

My dear brethren and sisters. — As I have listened to the remarks 
of our brethren who have .spoken to us during the sessions of this 
conference, there are two phases of this great work that I have been 
led to think about ; and that is, the gospel as it is preached at home 
in the homes of the Latter-day Saints, and abroad in the mission field 
by our elders that are laboring in this wonderful cause, and in con- 
nection with this, the great work that is being accomplished in the 
temples of the Lord for the dead. 

That I may be better understood, I desire to refer to the 110th 
section of the Doctrine and Covenants, a most wonderful section, 
which means so much to us as Latter-day Saints. There, in the 
presence of the Prophet Joseph Smith and his close associate Oliver 
Cowdery, a wonderful message came to them. The eyes of their un- 
derstanding were opened; that is, their spiritual eyes that they were 
blessed with, and they saw the Lord, even the Savior, Jesus Christ, 
upon the breastwork of that temple, and in the comforting words 
that he spoke to them, he told them that their sins were forgiven, 



124 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



that they were pure and holy before the Lord, and that he had accepted 
the great work that they had accomplished in the erection of 
that building, and that he was satisfied and pleased with that which 
had been done and accomplished by the Latter-day Saints — a most 
wonderful revelation. And I am sure a great satisfaction came into 
the hearts of those two brethren as they stood under the voice of 
this heavenly messenger and heard those soothing words. 

When this manifestation cleared away, another one appeared 
unto them. The Prophet Moses of old, who held the keys of the gather- 
ing of Israel, appeared unto them and conferred this authority upon 
them, that they might have that privilege or that power in this dispen- 
sation of the gospel. Up to this time the gospel had only been preached 
in a few of the eastern states and in parts of Canada, but within a 
year of that time, missionaries were sent out in the various states 
of this nation and across the water into Europe, into Great Britain 
and the Scandinavian countries, and a most wonderful harvest followed 
the labors of those men; the spirit of gathering followed conversion 
to the gospel. Many souls were made members of the Church 
through the testimonies of these brethren who came to them ; they 
accepted the gospel and the spirit of gathering followed it. Many 
souls were gathered into the fold of Christ; many joined hands with 
the Saints in this part of the land. And in addition to this, in part- 
fulfilment of that prophecy, Orson Hyde and John E. Page were 
set apart for a mission to Palestine. Their mission was to dedicate 
that land as a gathering place for the house of Israel. We are told 
that Mr. Page fell by the wayside ; Orson Hyde continued that wonder- 
ful journey through privations and hardships, and after a year and 
a-half's labor and work and worry, reached that part of the country, 
and we are told that on the Mount of Olives, with his face turned 
toward the city of Jerusalem, he alone offered that dedicatory prayer 
that he was sent there to offer. And we, of course, have wondered 
and have looked with astonishment as to how that condition might 
come about. Rut we saw in the great World War a condition brought 
about indicating that those people may be gathered back to their home 
country. And that prophecy will be fulfilled. 

My brethren and sisters, there is no question in my mind as to 
the fulfilment of prophecy, as to the great work that is in store for 
the Latter-day Saints. 

And, in connection with this mission to the living as it has been 
preached in the various nations of the earth, we have the vicarious 
work that is being accomplished and done for the dead. When we think 
of the eight temples finished and completed, and the ninth under 
erection, of the vast amount of work that is being accomplished for the 
dead, and the desire on the part of the Latter-day Saints to perform 
this great labor and mission, what a blessing it is ! Many souls who 
have gone to the grave without a knowledge of the gospel without 
the privilege of receiving or hearing it, are waiting for that work to 



ELDER JOHN A. BECKSTRAND

be accomplished for them, that they, too, may join with the Latter- 
day Saints in the great blessings of the gospel. 

I bear you my testimony that this is the work of the Lord, that 
this is the plan of salvation. Every man, woman, and child who 
will obey and live it, will be saved in the presence of our Father in 
heaven. And may we be faithful in the performance of our duties, 
day by day as Latter-day Saints, is my prayer. Amen. 

ELDER GEORGE T. HYDE 

(President of the Portncuf Stake of Zion) 

My brethren and sisters, I appreciate the honor that has come to 
me in being invited to address you for just a few moments, and 
I sense very keenly the responsibility that rests upon me in occupy- 
ing this 'most important position, and I realize, that only through 
the inspiration of our Father in heaven will I be able to say any- 
thing that will tend to benefit, comfort, or build us up in our most 
holy faith. 

I bring to you, my brethren and sisters, greetings from the 
Saints who dwell in Portneuf stake, who live over the border line, 
that invisible line which marks the geographical division between the 
State of Utah and Idaho. Possibly I am a stranger to you, my brethren 
and sisters, but I feel that we are all brethren and sisters in the 
great work of the Lord, all children of that great Father in heaven, 
all actuated by that same spirit, the spirit of the gospel of the Lord 
Jesus Christ. 

I have been coming to the conferences of the Church for many 
years, but never has the greatness, marvelousness, and the wonders 
of the work appealed to me as they have throughout the various 
sessions of this wonderful conference, and truly I realize that the 
Lord indeed is doing a marvelous and a wonderful work. I feel 
that the work of the Lord has made wonderful growth and progress 
since its organization, since those early days which our brethren have 
referred to here so beautifully this afternoon. When we contemplate 
the numbers that there are today in the membership of the Church, 
we can then in a sense realize that it is indeed a "marvelous work 
and a wonder." When we stop to contemplate the fact that there 
are today, as President Grant announced in his opening address, 1,700 
or m re of the young men and women of this Church engaged in 
missionary labors throughout the world, bearing the message of life 
and salvation to those who sit in darkness, taking to them the glad 
tidings that God has again made known his mind and will and 
restored to earth the authority to administer in the ordinances of 
his gospel. When we contemplate these things we can realize some- 
thing of the magnitude of the work that has already been, is being, 
and will be, accomplished, and I feel that the work of the Lord will 
make still more rapid strides, if we, the membership of the Church 



126 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



at home, truly live up to the teachings of the gospel, if we ourselves 
observe to do the commandments that our Father has given to us, 
if we magnify the duties that membership in the Church brings to 
us. I believe that if we do that, as our young men and young 
women go out into the nations of the earth declaring the word, they 
will have a stronger, a greater force behind them in the lives of 
their parents at home, in the power of the example that we are 
setting here, I feel that it is incumbent upon us to live the gospel 
of the Lord Jesus Christ. It is indeed a great and a marvelous work, 
and we are indeed a peculiar people. 

Some of the characteristics of the Church, we may say, too, are 
peculiar, and one of those characteristics that appeals to me and that 
I of times think of, is that it means on our part continual service, 
and work. There is no place, no time, in our lives when we can 
sit idly by, but we must continue faithfully in the service of our 
Master to the end, if we would reap the reward of our faith, and 
eternal lives in the kingdom of our Father. 

I feel that throughout the sessions of this great conference 
we have had some of the most wonderful, inspirational teachings, 
speaking and counsel, that have ever been given to the Church. The 
opening address of President Grant, enunciating the doctrine that 
it is necessary for us to keep the commandments, to live the laws 
of the gospel, to be faithful continually, brought into my mind 
the fact that if we would reap the benefits of the gospel, we must 
keep the commandments. I feel that while we are gaining numerically, 
making wonderful progress, there is still a greater work, I may call 
it an invisible work, that is going on throughout the entire world 
as a result of the restoration of the gospel. I recall that in that 
opening address of President Grant, he referred to the coming of 
Elijah and the fact that the spirit of Elijah has been poured out 
upon all the world. Over the nations of the world, the people every- 
where, has come a spirit of gathering the genealogies of their fore- 
fathers. They know not why, he said, but they are inspired through 
the coming into their hearts of the spirit of Elijah, which causes 
them to do that work. I feel, too, that many other truths of the 
gospel are being gradually taken up by various religious denomina- 
tions of the day; the leaven, in other words, is gradually working, 
leavening the lump. Notwithstanding our attention has been called 
to the fact that many of the churches are preaching and advocating 
that Jesus Christ is not the Only Begotten Son of the Father, we 
bear testimony that he is ; for that truth has been revealed anew 
to us — an additional evidence has been brought to us, that he is 
indeed the Son of God in the flesh. But many are denying that, 
and it seems to be creeping into the hearts of many, yet there are 
thousands, yea hundreds of thousands who do believe that he is 
indeed the Son of God and the Savior of the world, and many of them 
■are gradually adopting the truths of the everlasting gospel. 



ELDER GEORGE T. HYDE

The Word of Wisdom, is a wonderful and great law of life, 
simple truths of living I oftimes term it, which our Father in heaven 
so mercifully revealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith to guide us 
in our daily lives that we might be physically strong, that we might 
be spiritually awake and strong. Those wonderful principles enunciated 
in that, are being adopted by the scientists and men of wisdom 
throughout the length and breadth of the earth, and today many 
of our foremost men of science, men of ability along many lines, 
are advocating the living of those simple rules of life, the abstaining 
from strong drink, from tobacco, from tea and from coffee, and 
from using meat to excess — adopting those great truths that were 
made known to the Prophet Joseph Smith in the early history of 
the Church. So likewise are they adopting many other of the truths 
of the gospel, and so I feel that, by and by, in the providences of our 
Father in heaven, that the converts to the Church will be more numer- 
ous than they are at the present time. I feel that in the near future 
they will flock to the standard of Christ by the thousands. And 
this brings home to us the necessity on our part of living the gos- 
pel and teaching our children the wonderful truths of it, that they 
may grow up in the fear and admonition of the Lord, full of faith 
and the knowledge of the gospel that they may proclaim its won- 
drous truths to the nations and be capab'e and able ministers of the 
word. 

It was a wonderful address we had this morning from Elder 
Richards, relative to the youth of Israel. I never before listened to 
such a wonderful discourse upon that particular theme. He handled 
it so beautifully! It touched my heart. I have always felt, and I 
feel now, that we owe to our children a good and proper example. 
The great truth has come into my life, that example goes much 
farther than precept. O it is easy to talk to them; it is easy to 
tell them, do this, and do that, but it is a difficult thing, some- 
times, to live the principles which we advocate. Our daily lives 
should be such, that our children can follow in our footsteps. We 
should live the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, and by our example 
teach it to eur children. If we would have them observe the Word 
of Wisdom, I feel that we should observe it. If we would have them 
honor the Sabbath day and keep it holy, I feel that we should 
honor the Sabbath day. If we expect them to grow up full of 
faith and integrity and active in the Church, our lives must be such 
that they will lead our children into activity. 

I was never before so stirred in my life as I was some six months 
ago with the address of President Grant, when it was published in one 
of the periodicals. It appealed to me so strongly that "I am going to 
read an extract to you : 

This was toward the conclusion of that wonderful address. He 
,says : 



128 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



"I desire to read just two paragraphs from the prayer given at the 
dedication of the Alberta temple: 

" 'We thank thee, O Father, for the knowledge which we possess 
that thou dost live and that thy Son Jesus Christ is our Redeemer and 
our Savior, and that thy servant Joseph Smith, Junior, was and is a 
prophet of the true and the living God. And, O Father, may we ever 
be true and faithful to the gospel of thy Son, Jesus Christ, revealed 
through thy son Jospeh. We especially pray thee, O Father in heaven, 
to bless the youth of thy people in Zion and in all the world. Shield 
them from the adversary and from wicked and designing men. Keep the 
youth of thy people, O Father, in the straight and the narrow path that 
leads to thee. Preserve them from the pitfalls and snares that are laid 
for their feet. O, Father, may our children grow up in the nurture and 
admonition of the Lord Jesus Christ. Give unto them a testimony of the 
divinity of this work, as thou hast given it unto us, and preserve them in 
purity and in the truth.' " 

Then he added, "And I say unto you, O fathers in Israel: if you will 
set an example by being honest before God in the payment of your 
tithes, if you will observe the Word of Wisdom, if you will observe your 
family and your secret prayers, God will give you strength to preserve 
the youth of Zion, as mentioned in this supplication. May the Lord bless 
us and pour out upon us richly his Holy Spirit during this conference, is 
my prayer, and I ask it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen." 

That which appeals to me in this is that we desire that our chil- 
dren grow up in purity, that they be active men and women in the 
Church, honorable members of the communities where they live. Here 
are the words of the living prophet, pointing out to us how we may 
be successful. Our children are dearer to us than all the world ; 
they are the most precious jewels that .our Father in heaven could 
give us. We love them. We would give our very lives for them, 
and here are a few simple rules of life for their preservation, if we 
will but observe these rules, the prophet said we will be .successful 
in rearing our children in purity and deliver them from the pitfalls 
that constantly beset their paths. If we will observe the law of tithing 
honestly before God and before our children, if we will faithfully 
observe our family and secret prayers, and if we will faithfully 
observe the Word of Wisdom — the prophet says we shall have power 
and strength to preserve our children in purity. That is one of the 
greatest promises that has ever been made to us, and I have faith 
in it, I believe it, my brethren and sisters, and I want to bear my 
testimony that if you will keep the commandments of God and observe 
to do them, you will be successful in the rearing of your children. 

In conclusion, I bear testimony to the truth of the great work 
in which we are engaged. I know that it is of God, that in this 
day and age of the world he came from heaven to earth and visited 
the prophet Joseph Smith, and that other messengers came to Joseph 
under the direction of our Father in heaven, and restored the gospel 
in all its purity, with all its power, keys, and authority — all that is 
necessary for the salvation, and exaltation of all the children of men. 

May God bless you, my brethren and sisters. May you appre- 
ciate the blessing of membership in the Church of the Lord Jesus 
Christ, I pray. Amen. 



ELDER ANDREW J EN SON

ELDER ANDREW JENSON 

(Assistant Church Historian) 

I feel, my brethren and sisters, that it will be a hard task for 
me, as, in fact, it has been for the speakers who have preceded me, 
to hold my own against the amplifiers. The people here assembled 
have the choice between remaining seated here and listening" to us, or 
going out on the lawn to have a standing seat and listening to what is 
going on in the Tabernacle, and unless we are endowed with an unusual 
degree of the Spirit of the Lord, and thereby draw your interest, it 
may be a hard matter to keep you here. But I feel that the Saints 
gathered in this Assembly Hall are entitled to the blessings of the 
Lord as much as those congregated in the Tabernacle, as this meet- 
ing has been appointed by proper authority, and speakers selected, 
and it is our privilege to enjoy the Spirit of the Lord, and it is the 
privilege of the speakers here as well as the listeners, to receive the 
bread of life. 

I rejoice with my brethren in the excellent conference we have 
had, so far, and the last meeting, which is now in session over in 
the Tabernacle, is undoubtedly as interesting and instructive as the 
former sessions have been, and I trust that we all shall leave feeling 
that we have had one of the best conferences the Church has ever 
held. 

Never before since the Church was organized, have so many 
people attended a general conference as on this occasion, and it 
reminds me that it is just eighty years ago today since President 
Joseph Smith, the martyr, also had occasion to attend the largest 
conference the Church ever held up to that time. It was the mem- 
orable conference held in April, 1844, (the last conference the 
Prophet attended) on which occasion he asserted that all of North 
and South America was the land of Zion. Up to that time some 
of the brethren had entertained the idea that Nauvoo was already 
too far from Jackson county, Missouri, which was called Zion, or 
the place for the building of the City of Zion, and some of them had 
misgivings in regard to living in Illinois, thinking they were too 
far away from Jackson county, to be included in the land of Zion. 
The Prophet's declaration was therefore good and timely, as we are 
now very much farther away from Jackson county than Nauvoo is, 
and yet we are in the land of Zion, representing as we do here ninety 
stakes of Zion, all organized in this western land since the days of 
Nauvoo. 

I am expected, according to the appointment received, to say 
something to you in regard to the importance of history and the 
necessity of record-keeping. We Latter-day Saints have been un- 
usually blessed in regard to this matter, as the Lord has revealed 
to us in these the last days some of the missing links in the history 
of the world. When we were a part of the sectarian world, some 
of us were taught that the Lord created the world out of nothing; 



130 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



but the Lord, in new Scriptures, has revealed unto us the true history 
of the creation. On a certain occasion the Lord called Moses up 
into an exceeding high mountain and there showed him his creations 
— the many worlds that he had created. But he told Moses that 
he could not comprehend them all, as there were so many worlds 
that mortal man could not number them, but that those worlds are 
all numbered to the Lord. God then said : "And now, Moses, 
my son, I will speak unto thee concerning this earth upon which 
thou standest; and thou shalt write the things which I shall speak." 
(Moses 1 :40) . The Lord then revealed to Moses how the earth on which 
we live came into existence. This question has often arisen : Where 
did Moses, the first recognized historian, get his information 
from, in regard to the creation of the world, and also in regard to 
the flood, to Enoch, and Abraham and other patriarchs? What his- 
torians had written books before him from which he could copy? 
Legend says that a big pillar with historical inscriptions upon it had 
been erected on or near the site of old Babylon, on the river Euphra- 
tes, but that assertion has never been verified. The facts are that 
the Lord took Moses up on a high mountain and there revealed to 
him how the earth came into existence, and also told him about our 
father Adam in the garden of Eden, how he fell from grace, and 
furthermore that the gospel that we are preaching here today, and in 
which we rejoice at the present time, was preached to Adam in the 
beginning, and did not come into existence in the meridian of time. 
John was not the first man who baptized, but Adam was taught the 
principle of baptism. The gospel, as we receive it now, and as we 
understand it, was revealed to father Adam, was revealed to Enoch 
and Noah, was preached to Abraham, and was known in part in 
the days of Moses. This knowledge has come to us through the 
faithful labors of historians. The Ten Commandments were written 
by the finger of the Lord himself upon tablets of stone, and in ad- 
dition to that, Moses wrote his books, which seem to have existed 
in fragmentary form among the Israelites for generations, and when 
the great Babylonian captivity took place the people were scattered, as 
well as their records, and the Children of Israel lost for a while 
their national identity and records ; but when the Israelites came back 
from the Babylonian captivity there was a general reconstruction of 
affairs, under the direction of Ezra, the priest, and Nehemiah, who 
were the accepted leaders of the return to Jerusalem ; and it is recorded 
that the people got very much interested in their records and gen- 
ealogies. The following is from the writings of Nehemiah : 

"All the people gathered themselves together ; * * * and they spake to 
Ezra, the scribe, to bring the book of the law of Moses, which the Lord 
had commanded to Israel, and Ezra the priest brought the law before the 
congregation, both of men and women, and all that could hear with under- 
standing * * * * and he read therein * * * * and Ezra the scribe 
stood upon a pulpit of wood, which they had made for the purpose * * * 
and Ezra opened the hook in sight of all the people * * * * and 



ELDER ANDREW J EN SON 



131 



when he opened it, all the people stood up: and Ezra blessed the Lord, the 
great God. And all the people answered, 'Amen, Amen,' with lifting up 
their hands; and they bowed their heads, and worshipped the Lord with 
their faces to the ground * * * * So they read in the book in the 
law of God distinctly, and gave the sense, and caused them to understand 
the reading * * * * All the people wept, when they heard the words 
of the law." (Neh. 8:1-9). 

We can scarcely realize how much we are indebted to the his- 
tory of the past which has been written for our benefit. Reverting 
to the history of the creation, we have a duplicate form of the 
same in what was written by Abraham, many, many years ago — re- 
vealed anew in our dispensation. The writings of Abraham, which 
came into the possession of Joseph Smith in 1835, contain a very 
beautiful account of the creation of the world, going hand in hand 
with that which, a little later, was revealed to Moses. When, in a 
sectarian world, some of us were taught as children that God created 
the earth out of nothing, we were taught that which is not true. 
The writings of Abraham tell us that the Lord stood among those 
"who were with him." That accounts for the term "Gods" being used 
sometimes instead of the singular form "God". God stood in the 
midst of his associates and said to them: 

"We will go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these 
materials and we will make an earth wherein these (God's children) may 
dwell, and we will prove them herewith to see if they will do all things 
whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them. And they who keep 
their first estate shall be added upon; and they who keep not their first 
estate shall not have glory in the same kingdom with those who keep 
their first estate; and they who keep their second estate shall have glory 
added upon their heads for ever and ever." (Book of Abraham 3:24-26). 

This is a most beautiful revelation which has come to us in these 
last days through the Prophet Joseph Smith. We frequently sing : 
"We thank thee, O God, for a Prophet," "Praise to the man who 
communed with Jehovah," etc., in appreciation of modern prophets 
and modern revelations, because these new revelations serve as a key 
to the old revelations. The Christian world generally have one book, 
the Bible, which they do not understand, while the Latter-day Saints 
have four sacred books, which they do understand, for the Lord has 
given us the key in new revelation to both new and old revelations. 

And here we have the Book of Mormon. Do you know what 
importance was attached to records in the early Book of Mormon 
days? Does it appeal to you that a certain justifiable homicide was 
committed in the interest of the family of Lehi which left Jerusalem 
600 years before the birth of the Savior? Do you remember what 
happened to Laban who lived in Jerusalem at the time that Lehi and 
his family were commanded by the Lord to leave that city to go 
into the wilderness, relying upon the Lord leading them to a land 
of promise far away ? After they had been in the wilderness a short 
time, they realized that they had no records with ihem. They did 



132 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



not even know the genealogy of their forefathers; but Laban, then- 
kinsman, had the records, and Nephi, the faithful ,son of Lehi, and 
his brethren, were commanded to go back to Jerusalem to obtain these 
records from Laban. They gathered all the gold and silver and 
precious things which the family had left in Jerusalem at the time 
of their exodus, and offered it to Laban in exchange for the records. 
But Laban, seeing the treasure, was tempted to possess it, and, after 
getting it, he sent his servants after Nephi and his brethren to kill 
them, and they would undoubtedly have been destroyed, had they 
not succeeded in escaping from Jerusalem. Laban took their property 
and kept the records. But Nephi prevailed upon his brethren to 
return to Jerusalem once more and try again. The Lord certainly 
did not want the family of Lehi to go into this land of promise 
without a knowledge of their forefathers, for in that case they would 
be in danger of losing not only their genealogy, but also their lan- 
guage and' religion. When the sons of Lehi arrived in Jerusalem 
and found Laban in possession of the riches of which he had robbed 
the estate of Lehi, they devised new plans for obtaining the records, 
and to cut a long story short Nephi was constrained, or rather com- 
manded, by the spirit, to slay Laban. It was better that one wicked 
man should perish than that the whole people which the Lord in- 
tended to lead into the promised land far away, should dwindle into 
ignorance and unbelief. That is how the Nephite.s came possessed 
of the brass plates, which, among other things, contained the law 
of Moses, even similar writings to those which caused the Israelites 
in the days of Ezra and Nehemiah to glorify God. On that occasion 
the law of Moses and other things which had been written were 
preserved for the benefit of the Israelites who returned to Jerusalem, 
after their captivity in Babylon, to rebuild the temple and to com- 
mence anew their national existence. 

And so the sons, of Lehi obtained the brass plates and in due 
course of time crossed the great waters to the land of promise. But 
the brass plates were not sufficient; the Lord commanded Nephi 
to make plates of his own — golden plates — upon which he might record 
the doings of his own people. Thus Nephi made a record upon 
his plates of how his father's family left Jerusalem, how they traveled 
through the wilderness, how they built a ship, how they crossed the 
great waters, and how they finally landed upon this great western 
continent, this land of America, which became a choice land above 
all other lands, after the flood had devastated the earth in the time 
of Noah. Now it is recorded that Nephi was faithful in keeping 
the commandments of God. He even made two sets of plates; on 
one set he recorded the things that pertained to the service of God, 
and upon the other plates, which were the larger plates, he recorded 
the secular history of his people, including the story of the kings 
and some of the troubles, contentions and wars which occurred be- 
tween the Nephites and the Lamanites. We have in the Book of 



ELDER ANDREW JEN SON 



133 



Mormon a translation from the small plates of Nephi, and we also 
have in that sacred record Mormon's abridgment of the text of the 
large plates of Nephi. These things are very'precious to us, and that 
such would be the case was well understood by the prophets of old, 
even by Nephi — that same Nephi I have already been speaking of — 
and the Lord promised him that if he would be faithful in recording the 
history of his people, his writings should be preserved for the benefit 
of his posterity. In his second book, third chapter he writes : 

"Wherefore, the fruit of thy loins shall write; and the fruit of the 
loins of Judah shall write; and that which shall be written by the fruit 
of thy loins, and also that which shall be written by the fruit of the 
loins of Judah, shall grow together, unto the confounding of false doc- 
trines, and laying down of contentions, and establishing peace among 
the fruit of thy loins, and bringing them to the knowledge of their fathers 
in the latter days; and also to the knowledge of my covenants, saith the 
Lord." (2 Nephi 3:12). 

This promise was repeated later on. Nephi writes, "The Lord 
God promised unto me that these things which I write shall be kept 
and preserved and handed down unto my seed from generation to 
generation." (2 Nephi 25 :21). 

Enos, a son of Jacob (Nephi's brother), writes, "I had faith 
and I did cry unto the Lord that he would preserve the records, 
and he covenanted with me that he would bring them forth unto the 
Lamanites in his own due time." (Enos 1:16). 

Helaman records that many records were being kept of the pro- 
ceedings of the Nephites. He says : "There are many books, many 
records of every kind, and they have been kept chiefly by the 
Nephites." (Hela. 3:15). 

The historian, Mormon, writes in his abridgment, "There are 
records which do contain all the proceedings of this people and a more 
short but a true account was given by Nephi." (That is part of the 
record we now have). "Therefore I have made my record of these 
things according to the record of Nephi, which was engraved on the 
plates which were called the plates of Nephi. And behold I do make 
the record upon the plates which I have made with mine own hands." 
(3 Nephi 5:9-16). 

I will read one more extract. Mormon, in giving the history in 
his abridgment from the large plates of Nephi, departs from the 
historical narrative in speaking of the administration of Jesus Christ 
among the Nephites, and writes: 

"And now there cannot be written in this book [Mormon's abridg- 
ment] even a hundredth part of the things which Jesus did truly teach 
unto the people; 

"But behold the plates of Nephi do contain the more part of the 
things which he taught the people [of Nephi]. - 

"And these things have I written, which are a lesser part of the things 
which he taught the people; and I have written them to the intent that 
they may be brought again unto this people from the Gentiles, according 
to the words which Jesus hath spoken." (3 Nephi 26:6-8). 



134 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



1 will quote one more instance. The chief recorder in those 
days was Nephi, not the first Nephi, but one who lived later on. 
A prophet by the name of Samuel, a Lamanite, had predicted that 
when Christ should rise from the dead, some of the dead Saints who 
had lived in former days should arise and appear unto many, and 
the historian had seemingly overlooked that fact, and when Jesus 
visited the Nephites on another occasion ( for he visited them a number 
of times) he said : 

"Bring the record which .ye have kept. And when Nephi had brought 
forth the records and laid them before him, he cast his eyes upon them and 
said : Verily I say unto you, I commanded my servant Samuel, the Lamanite, 
that he should testify unto this people, that at the day that the Father should 
glorify his name in me that there were many Saints who should arise from 
the dead, and should appear unto many, and should minister unto them. 
And lie said unto them: Were it not so? And his disciples answered 
him and said: Yea, Lord, Samuel did prophesy according to thy words, 
and they were all fulfilled. And Jesus said unto them; How be it that 
ye have not written this thing, that many Saints did arise and appear unto 
many and did minister unto them? And it came to pass that Nephi re- 
membered that this thing had not been written. And it came to pass 
that Jesus commanded that it should be written; therefore it was written 
according as he commanded." — (3 Nephi 23:7-13). 

Now, passing on, brethren and sisters, did it ever occur to you that 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints could not be organized, 
or at least, it was not organized, until the Book of Mormon had come 
forth. We are called "Mormons" today, and while the name, of 
course, is in one sense a misnomer, it is not altogether so, because 
there were none known as "Mormons" among the children of men in 
America, or elsewhere, until the Book of Mormon appeared, and that 
book came into existence just before the Church was organized. 
Thus there were in reality "Mormons" in the world before there was 
any Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, for as soon as the 
Book of Mormon had been printed, Joseph Smith and those as- 
sociated with him at once became known as "Mormons." 

We find that the Book of Mormon contained so many truths in 
regard to the gospel of Jesus Christ that when we place it beside 
the New Testament, and especially with that which was written by 
Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, we have most precious documents. 
The writings of these four evangelists placed by the side of that which 
was written by Nephi and the other historians on this continent give 
us what we sometimes call the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ. 
That does not imply that we in these two books have everything the 
Lord wants us to know, for he will yet reveal many things which 
will make us wise unto salvation. However, until the Book of Mor- 
mon was printed in the English language, Joseph Smith was not 
authorized to organize the Church, but with the Book_ of Mormon 
and the Bible, put side by side, he understood the principles of the 
gospel and how to organize the Church, being aided by the revelations 
which he from time to time received from the Lord.

The coming forth of the Book of Mormon is a very interesting 
theme to speak about. We frequently deliver lectures on the Book 
of Mormon, and we do not tire of dwelling upon the faithfulness of 
the Prophet Joseph, upon the testimony of the Three Witnesses to 
the Book of Mormon and also upon the solemn testimony of the Eight 
Witnesses. We are pleased to know that all these men were true 
and faithful to their testimonies, and some of them in the midst of 
troubles and persecutions staked their all upon the fact that the Book 
of Mormon is true. 

The Nephite record, which, according to prophesy, should come 
from the earth lay buried in the Hill Cumorah for 1427 years. The 
peop'e of which the book bears record were destroyed from the earth 
and the record was sealed up and buried by Moroni — the last Nephi 
prophet and historian. When it finally came forth it was like a voice 
from the ground, or a message from the grave. The Hill Cumorah 
was opened, the plates delivered by Moroni (who now appeared as 
a heavenly messenger) to Joseph who translated the records into 
English, and the people at once began to read it. It was the record 
of a people which no longer existed, but which had once flourished 
on this continent, and among the most precious narratives contained 
in it was an account of that which God, through his Son and his 
prophets, accomplished in this western continent. 

Now, brethren and sisters, coming clown to our own day and 
dispensation, I wish to remark that we Latter-day Saints are not 
destined to go through the same ordeal as the Nephites; we are not 
tO' be destroyed ; we are to stay here for ever ; hence we should learn 
a lesson from the records of the Bihe and the Nephite records in 
regard to the keeping of our own records. What if we had no 
historians today? What could we do even now in writing the history 
of the Prophet Joseph Smith so many years after he suffered martyr- 
dom? Tt could be done perhaps after a fashion, but could not be 
done correctly from memory ; but we have a good record of the Church 
from the beginning written at the time when the events occurred. 
Permit me to remind you of the fact that the very first commandment 
which the Lord gave to his Church almost immediately after it was 
organized, was this : "Behold there shall be a record kept among 
you." You will find this the very first sentence of the very first 
revelation given to the Church after its organization on the 6th of 
April, 1830. 

Oliver Cowdery, who had assisted the Prophet Joseph Smith in 
translating the Book of Mormon, was made the first Church recorder. 
Later, John Whitmer, one of the Eight Witnesses, was called to be 
the Church recorder, and since that time we have always had Church 
recorders and historians. 

Now, brethren and sisters, I want'to emphasize the importance 
of keeping records. We should feel like Parley P. Pratt who, in 
writing the preface to his Voice of Warning, said: "Should the author 



136 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



be called to sacrifice his life for the cause of truth, he will have 
the consolation that it will be said of him as it was said of Abel, viz: 
Tie being dead, yet speaketh'." Parley P. Pratt is alive today. He 
was martyred in 1857 by a wicked man, near the town of Van 
Buren, in Arkansas, but Elder Pratt is still preaching the gospel ; his 
Voice of Warning is read by thousands and tens of thousands today. 
His Key to Theology and his Autobiography are still read by the youth 
of Zion, and, if I can judge from my own experience, the Autobiography 
of Parley P. Pratt has made a deeper impression upon the youth 
of Israel than any other book that has been written so far. In saying 
this I do not slight any other literary production written by the 
Elders of the Church, but the Autobiography of Parley P. Pratt is, 
in my estimation, faith-promoting from the first to the last chapter, 
and to me it proved an inspiration indeed. I owe to the existence 
and to the reading of that book much of what I am today. After 
reading that book I felt a great desire to become a servant of God, 
and in my reflections I thought: Why cannot I seek unto God and 
receive similar blessings to those received by Brother Pratt? So I 
began as a youth to seek more earnestly after the truth of heaven than 
I had ever sought before, and I desired to become a missionary. 
I wanted to preach the gospel, and the Lord in that regard has 
answered my prayers, as I have filled a number of missions for the 
Church. 

But I have been more particularly interested in the history of 
our people. A short time ago I summarized the number of miles 
which I have traveled in my lifetime. That may not mean much, as 
our salvation does not depend upon the number of miles traveled or 
the length of sermons preached. But there is nevertheless something 
interesting connected with preaching and traveling, when done with 
an eye single to the glory of God ; and when I discovered that I had 
traveled something like 469,000 miles, mainly in the interest of Church 
history, I felt somewhat satisfied with my ei forts and the discharge 
of my duties in that direction. 

Now, I wish to say to you, my brethren and sisters, that we 
are still pioneers in the cause of Christ. "Mormonism" is not yet 
one hundred years old, and we have as a fact only just commenced 
to exist as a people. One thought I desire to impress here upon you. 
It is this : If you ever had a desire to live in the days of the Savior 
and to belong to that Church which he and his apostles organized 
1900 years ago, you would, after the lapse of 100 years, have had 
the choice of one of two things : either to become a martyr for the 
gospel's sake, or to be swept away by the wave of apostasy. Compare 
this with the assertion made at this conference that the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was never in a better condition 
than it is today, and that its membership was never more numerous 
or prosperous than it is at the present time. What can we say of 
the original Church in the light of history, after it had existed one 



ELDER ANDREW J EN SON 



137 



hundred years? There was very little left of it. The apostasy which 
commenced to show itself in the days of Paul had spread to such 
an extent that after the great lights of the Church had fallen as 
martyrs, the great majority of the Saints had turned away from the 
gospel as originally taught by the Savior. So we thank God for the 
(dispensation of the fulness of times, and we are writing the history 
of a people the like of which has never been written before. It is 
not a history of an ancient people, or of a past dispensation, such as 
that of the first Christian era or the dispensation of Adam, Enoch, 
Noah, Abraham and Moses. All these dispensations had their day, 
and we know something of their history. But in our case the work of 
the Lord is here to remain, and it behooves us to remain with it ; and 
our children after us, we trust, will continue the work even more faith- 
fully and successfully than we have done. 

My message to you, my brethren and sisters, is this : You, and 
particularly the old veterans who sit before me (and you will all be old 
by and by), write your histories and biographies. 1 am already gray- 
haired myself. I commenced my missionary experience when I was 
the youngest of all my missionary companions, but now I am num- 
bered among the older ones, and I would like to feel that I have not 
lived in vain. I do not wish to die, I never want to die. I know I 
shall die as to mortality, but otherwise I want to live on continuously, 
and I want to leave something for posterity. I have been privileged 
to write some books which I think will be read with considerable in- 
terest after I shall have passed to the other side ; they are already 
appreciated by some. And as I think of myself I think of you — you 
fathers and mothers — who are now living but who in a little while will 
be in the spirit world, like myself. Do you not desire to leave behind you 
something for your children to read? Do you not desire to preach 
the gospel after you are dead and gone as to mortality? If you do, 
write your histories. Dictate the experiences of your lives to your 
sons and daughters, that they may write them, for wc have among us 
many young and talented people, our sons and daughters and grand- 
children, who can write good English. Let them, from your dictation, 
record something of your life's work, and do it without delay. Take 
this timely advice from one of your historians who has spent his 
whole life in studying these matters. Do not be satisfied to live *he 
short span of seventy years, but live forever! Record that which 
God has done for you and by you, and if you have a testimony that 
this is the work of God, bequeath that testimony to posterity. I 
believe that nearly all who are sitting here under the sound of my v oice 
could bear the same testimony as those who have testified from this 
stand — the speakers at these meetings. Based upon many years of 
observations, I may make the statement that our sons and dajghters 
will think more of us after we have left them than they do now. when 
we are with them. Parents, as a rule, are not appreciated as they 
fhould be until after they have passed into eternity. Then, after the 



138 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



children become fatherless and motherless, they will appreciate their 
parentage, and endeavor to remember what their fathers and mothers 
have taught them by precept as well as by example. Let us not rely 
upon the public records to do us justice, but let us pay special attention 
also to our individual records which will be of equal importance to those 
who shall live after us, and particularly to our own posterity throughout 
generations to come. 

God bless you, my brethren and sisters. My testimony is the same 
as those which have been borne by my brethren who have already 
addressed you. "Mormonism" is true. Joseph Smith is a true Prophet. 
Through him God restored to earth the true gospel of Jesus Christ, 
and I for one, feel that I owe everything that I am in life, spiritually 
and temporally, to that gospel, the gospel of Jesus Christ. And I feel 
grateful to the father of these boys (referring to two sons of the late 
Apostle Erastus Snow sitting on the stand) who came over to Scand- 
inavia in 1850 to introduce the true gospel of Jesus Christ to the 
inhabitants of northern Europe. I was then in the spirit world, and 
I imagine that 1 thought it was time for me to enter into mortality, 
so I asked God to send me down to be born on the 11th of December, 
1850, as Erastus Snow and his brethren had arrived in Denmark on 
the 14th of June previously. I do not remember that 1 asked to be 
sent down at the time of my birth, but I can imagine such a possibility, 
because in the spirit world I may have known something of what was 
taking place on the earth and may have asked for the privilege of 
coming down to take part in this gospel dispensation. 

God bless you. May he enable us all to do our duty, not only 
in history-making and record-keeping, but in keeping the command- 
ments of God generally speaking, until the end, so that we eventually 
may be saved in the kingdom of God. This is my desire and sincere 
prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

The Church authorities were presented and unanimously sustained, 
as at the Tabernacle. 

The choir sang. "Glorious things of Thee are spoken," and bene- 
d : cf'on was pronounced by Elder Prank R. Snow of the High Council 
of Ensign stake. 

CLOSING SESSION 

The closing session of the conference was held in the Tablernacle 
on Sunday Afternoon, April 6, 1924, at 2 o'clock. President Heber 
J. Grant presided. 

The choir and congregation sang the hymn, "The Spirit of God 
like a fire is burning." 

Invocation was offered by Elder Daniel G. Miller, President of 
the Yellowstone stake of Zion. 

The choir sang the song, "Have faith, ye Saints." 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN

ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 

I desire earnestly, while I stand before you this afternoon, 
to have the words I speak prompted by the spirit of our heavenly 
Father. 

APPEAL FOR GREATER INTEREST IN LEARNING HOW TO LEAD AND TEACH 

THE YOUNG. 

Like Brother Stephen L. Richards, I was greatly pleased to have 
the President in his opening adres.s make a special appeal to parents 
and to the members of the Church generally in the interest of proper 
training for our young people. I propose this afternoon to make 
an appeal, as strong as is in my power, to all the people of the Church 
to take advantage of the training that is being offered in practically 
every ward in the Church in the teacher-training classes. 

We are a community of teachers. Only by teaching effectively 
can our real mission be accomplished. By taking this work in teacher- 
training, certainly all who desire to do so can increase their teaching 
efficiency. If you have a son over whom you do not have satis- 
factory control, I believe the teacher-training course will help you to 
secure that control. If you have a daughter who does not seem to 
take kindly to your instructions, if she is not willing to go in that way 
which you indicate, your influence with her, I believe, will be greater 
if you study teacher-training. 

1 f you are presiding over a ward, or a stake, or any organization, 
if you are a teacher in a class. I believe you will be able to do your 
work more effectively if you take up this course of study. In the 
Church we want more men like George Goddard ; more men like 
Karl G. Maeser, and George H. Brimhall. These are unusual teachers. 
By study, real struggle, and inspiration, they have acquired the in- 
formation contained in the lessons that we are attempting to teach 
in our teacher-training classes. 

EXAMPLE OF A FARMER WHO, HAVING THE PRIESTHOOD, WAS A GREAT 

TEACHER. 

Long years ago in one of our "Mormon" villages, there was 
a great teacher. He had taken no college honors, nor was he a 
public school teacher. This man was a farmer. His hands were 
plainly marked with the indications of arduous toil. He wore common 
clothing. He was just an ordinary laborer, but he was a natural 
teacher, a great teacher — a teacher of the Bible, lie taught my Sun- 
day school class. This man did not confine his teaching to the Sabbath 
day, nor to the hours of Sunday school. During the evenings of the 
week he used to have a group of us bare-footed, commonly-clad little 
youngsters in the country go to his home, and there he would teach 
us our Sunday school lessons. 

This man was a diligent student of the gospel, of the scriptures, 
and of human nature. He studied thoroughly both his subject and 



140 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



his class. Through hard work and inspiration he became an unusually 
inspirational and successful teacher. 

I shall refer somewhat fully to one lesson which he taught because it 
illustrates what teachers can do who by faithful effort acquire splendid 
teaching ability. 

This man magnified the Priesthood which he held. He was filled 
with a burning testimony, a love for studying the scriptures and an 
ardent desire to assist in teaching the gospel to all the world — for he 
believed the scripture which says that when this has been accomplished 
"then shall the end come"' (Matt. 24:14). In his life, his work and 
teaching, he certainly sought first the kingdom. The logic in the 
following Bible lesson on the apostasy and restoration, as he gave it, 
illustrates what can be accomplished by those who use the methods 
that are taught in our teacher-training classes. 

The teacher was preparing us for our Sunday school jubilee. He 
would instruct us something like this : 

THE GREAT APOSTASY PREDICTED 

"There is to come a time when the gospel will not be found 
anywhere in all the world. I learn this from the Bible. The scripture 
says: (II Tim. 4:3,4) 'For the time will come when they will not 
endure sound doctrine ; but after their own lusts shall they heap unto 
themselves teachers having itching ears ; and they shall turn away 
their ears from the truth and shall be turned unto fables'." 

"Now boys," he would continue, "that prediction is recorded in 
holy writ. Furthermore, the Bible says: (Isa. 24:5) 'the earth also 
is defiled under the inhabitants thereof, because they have transgressed 
the laws, changed the ordinances, broken the everlasting covenant ;' 
that is the Bible, and here," he said, "recorded in holy writ, are the 
words of our heavenly Father himself. He said in a most positive 
fashion that sometime or other, the gospel shall not be found any- 
where in all the world. These words are as follows: (Amos 8:11,12). 

THE APOSTASY TO BE UNIVERSAL. 

" 'Behold the days come, saith the Lord God, that I will send 
a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor of thirst for water, 
but of hearing the word of the Lord. And they shall wander from 
sea to sea, and from the north even to the east, shall they run to and 
fro to seek the word of the Lord, and .shall not find it.' Thus there 
is predicted a time when the gospel of Jesus Christ cannot be found 
anywhere. 

GOOD CHEER FOR THOSE WHO ENDURE TO THE END. 

"But I want you boys to remember," continued this farmer 
teacher, "that the scripture also says: (Matt. 24:12), 'And because 
iniquity shall abound, the love of many will wax cold.' But you must 
be cheered up, all the time, by these words written in this splendid 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 



141 



book; (Matt. 24:13) 'But he that shall endure unto the end, the same 
shall be saved'." 

TEACHING FOR DOCTRINE THE COMMANDMENTS OF MEN 

This man with a group of country boys, bare-footed, sitting be- 
fore him, was a real master. He said : "And the scripture describes 
a little more clearly the conditions that are to prevail in the world, for: 
'This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoreth me 
with their lips ; but their heart is far from me. But in vain they do 
worship me,' saith the Lord, 'teaching for doctrines the commandments 
of men'." (Matt. 15:8, 9). 

CONDITIONS IN THE LAST DAYS — THE BOASTING OF SOME WHO LEARN 

A LITTLE SCIENCE. 

A passage he used to emphasize was quoted yesterday by 
Dr. Taimage. It reads: (II Tim. 3:1-3) "This know also, that 
in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers 
of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphmers, dis- 
obedient to parents, unthankful, unholy. Without natural af- 
fection, truce-breakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers 
of those that are good." 

"That is the condition, that is going to prevail in the world. 
Men will even be 'despisers of those that are good' (II Tim. 3:3, 4), 
'traitors, heady, highminded. lovers of pleasures more than lovers 
of God.' I want you boys to remember," said this great farmer 
teacher, "that in the world there is to be a time when people will 
be lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God, traitors, heady, 
highminded lovers of pleasures, as I have said, more than lovers 
of God, (II Tim. 3:5) 'having a form of godliness, but denying 
the power thereof.' These are they who rely upon themselves; 
these are they who are called scientific ; these are they who rely 
upon their own judgment. These are they who think they have 
no need of the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. These are they 
who boast of their own intelligence, of their own knowledge, of their 
own studies, of their own conclusions, these are they who have 
no reliance in, and think they need no help from the God of Wash- 
ington, the God of Franklin and the God of Lincoln. The scripture 
tells what their condition is. They are always studying, yes, in 
the language of the Bible, they are (II Tim. 3:7) 'Ever learning, 
and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth'." 

THE THRILLING DREAM 

Then he drew our attention to that splendid vision of Ne- 
buchadnezzar, the King, and the result of Daniel's appeal to divine 
providence for information concerning the dream and its inter- 
pretation. The king had forgotten the dream. And Daniel prayed 
that he might be able to draw the dream to the remembrance of 
the king and give him the interpretation thereof. He told the king 



142 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



that in the dream he saw a great image with a head of gold, with 
shoulders and arms of silver, with body and thighs of brass, with 
legs of iron, with feet and toes of iron and clay, miry clay, mixed 
together. And that he saw a little stone cut out of a mountain 
without hands; and that it rolled forth and smote upon the great 
image and broke it into pieces, and the little stone grew into a 
mountain that filled the whole earth. 

Now for the interpretation: The head Daniel saw, represented 
the king himself. There are to be other kingdoms afterwards and 
these are to be divided — the arms, the legs, the feet, the toes — 
these represent many kingdoms. See with what clearness the Bible 
says: (Dan. 2:44). 

THE GOD OF HEAVEN TO SET UP A KINGDOM THAT SHALL NEVER BE 
DESTROYED — TO STAND FOREVER. 

" 'And in the days of these kings shall the god of heaven set 
up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed.' That is a strong 
sentence. I put the emphasis on that word, never. 'A kingdom that 
shall never be destroyed,' nor will this kingdom be left to other people, 
'but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall 
stand foreveS." 

" 'Forasmuch as thou sawest (Daniel 2:45) that the stone was cut 
out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, 
the brass, the clay, the silver and the gold ; the great God hath made 
known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter ; and the dream 
is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure,' said this splendid teacher, 
this farmer, this man of God, bearing and magnifying the holy Priest- 
hood. "Let me read to you further," he would say: (Rev. 14:6, 7). 

ANGEL IN THE MIDST OF HEAVEN RESTORING THE GOSPEL. 

" ' And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the 
everlasting gospel to preach to them that dwell on the earth, and to 
every nation, kindred, and tongue, and people, saying with a loud voice. 
Fear God, and give glory to him ; for the hour of his judgment is come : 
and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the 
fountains of waters.' That is the prophecy." 

Who in all the world should receive the angel? A philosopher, a 
statesman, a wise man, a scholar? No, a boy; place your trust in boys 
and they will not fail you. When the Father himself, the great Creator 
of the heavens and the earth, wanted to deliver an important message 
to the world, he called a boy. The angel flew through the midst of 
heaven ; the angel delivered the message. Was it done by divine 
providence or by the wisdom of Joseph Smith, a boy — age fourteen? 

THE TEMPLE AN EXPRESSION OF THE FAITH OF THE PEOPLE IN THE 
MESSAGE OF THE ANGEL. 

Across the way, on this very block, stands that great temple of 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 



143 



granite, dedicated to the Lord. On the top of it is a statue of the 
Angel Moroni, placed there in commemoration of the fulfilment 
of this clear-cut prophetic .scripture. 

The country teacher said : "The angel is to fly through the midst 
of heaven ; the kingdom is to be established over which Jesus, the Son 
of God, the King of kings and the Lord of lords, is to preside." 

WHERE IS THE KINGDOM TO BE BUILT THAT SHALL LAST FOREVER? — WAR 

TO CEASE. 

"Where is it to be established? We look to the Bible for that 
information." 

These are the words the teacher read. They were quoted yester- 
day by President Penrose: (Micah 4:1,2) 

"But in the last days it shall come to pass, that the mountain of 
the house of the Lord shall be established in the top of the moun- 
tains, and it shall be exalted above the hills ; and people shall flow 
unto it. And many nations shall come, and say, "Come, and let us go 
up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob ; 
and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths : for 
the law .shall go forth of Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jeru- 
salem ;' and in these days, the last days, it continues : 'And he shall 
judge among many people, (Micah 4:3) and rebuke strong nations 
afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their 
spears into pruning hooks : nation shall not lift up sword against nation, 
neither shall they learn war any more'." 

THE GREAT TEACHER, A FARMER, BUT A MAN OF GOD. 

This is the sort of lesson that one plain man (Samuel Orfne), in 
a little "Mormon" village, (Tooele) long years ago, a farmer in or- 
dinary farmer's clothing, taught to a group of bare-footed youngsters. 
God bless his memory. Let us remember that .scripture that he em- 
phasized so positively: (Matt. 24:12,13) "'Because iniquity shall 
abound, the love of many shall wax cold, but, he that shall endure unto 
the end, the same shall be saved'." 

Thus by the use of teacher-training methods this plain country 
gentleman with scripture quotations made clear to us, his students, the 
whole plan of the apostasy and the modern gospel restoration. 

God bless our teachers. Bless the parents who by study and prayer- 
ful jef forts prepare themselves to teach their children. Bless the class 
teachers, the visiting teachers, and those who teach from the pulpit, 
that all may by resonable effort, and the inspiration to which they are 
entitled become effective teachers and leaders of men, I humbly pray, 
through Jesus Christ, Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 

Within the last year a distinguished citizen of this country, 
prompted, undoubtedly, by his great love for humanity, offered one 
hundred thousand dollars as a prize to anyone who would submit a 
plan that would produce world peace. 

THE WORLD AND ITS PEACE PROBLEMS 

Since that offer was made, I have thought upon it many times, 
and have asked, What have we to do with a proposition of that char- 
acter? What have we to do with the world and its peace problems? 
And there has come to me in the contemplation of this subject the 
burning conviction that we have much to do with the world and its 
affairs, not because of ambition which we have to become a world 
power, but because of the appointment of the Lord unto this people. 
We cannot separate ourselves from the world and its affairs. I read 
from the first section of the Book of Doctrine and Covenants these 
words from the Lord himself, to the Church : 

"Wherefore, I the Lord, knowing the calamity which should come 
upon the inhabitants of the earth, called upon my servant Joseph Smith, 
Jun., and spake unto him from heaven, and gave him commandments; 

"And also gave commandments to others, that they should proclaim 
these things unto the world; and all this that it might be fulfilled, which 
was written by the prophets — 

"The weak things of the world shall come, forth and break down the 
mighty and strong ones, that man should not counsel his fellow man, 
neither trust in the arm of flesh — 

"But that every man might speak in the name of God the Lord, even 
the Savior of the world; 

"That faith also might increase in the earth; 

"That mine everlasting covenant might be established; 

"That the fulness of my gospel might be proclaimed by the weak 
and the simple unto the ends of the world, and before kings and rulers. 

"Behold, I am God and have spoken it; these commandments are of 
me, and were given unto my servants in their weakness, after the manner 
of their language, that they might come to understanding." 

In this same connection, I wish to read a few verses from the 
133rd section of the Book of Doctrine and Covenants, beginning 
with the 57th verse : 

"And for this cause, that men might be made partakers of the glories 
which were to he revealed, the Lord sent forth the fulness of his gospel, 
his everlasting covenant, reasoning in plainness and simplicity- — ■ 

"To prepare the weak for those things which are coming on the earth, 
and for the Lord's errand in the day when the weak shall confound the 
wise, and the little one become a strong nation, and two shall put their 
tens of thousands to flight. 

"And by the weak things of the earth the Lord shall thrash the na- 
tions by the pow«r of his Spirit.

"And for this cause these commandments were given; they were com- 
manded to be kept from the world in the day that they were given, but 
now are to go forth unto all flesh — 

"And this according to the mind and will of the Lord, who ruleth 
over all flesh. 

"And unto him that repenteth and sanctifieth himself before the Lord 
shall be given eternal life. 

"And upon them that hearken not to the voice of the Lord shall 
be fulfilled that which was written by the prophet Moses, that they should 
be cut off from among the people. 

"And also that which was written by the prophet Malachi: For, 
behold, the day cometh that shall burn as an oven, and all the proud, 
yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble; and the day that cometh 
shall burn them up, saith the Lord of hosts, that it shall leave them 
neither root nor branch. 

"Wherefore, this shall be the answer of the Lord unto them: 

"In that day when I came unto mine own, no man among you 
received me, and you were driven out. 

"When I called again there was none of you to answer; yet my 
arm was not shortened at all that I could not redeem, neither my power 
to deliver. 

"Behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea. I make the rivers a wilder- 
ness; their fish stink, and die for thirst. 

"I clothe the heavens with blackness, and make sackcloth their cover- 
ing. 

"And this shall ye have of my hand — ye shall lie down in sorrow. 

"Behold, and lo, there are none to deliver you; for ye obey not 
my voice when I called to you out of the heavens; ye believed not my 
servants, and when they were sent unto you ye received them not. 

"Wherefore, they sealed up the testimony and bound up the law, and 
ye were delivered over unto darkness." 

THREE SPECIFIC PURPOSES OF THE CHURCH 

These scriptures leave upon the Church a binding obligation to 
the world. Ninety-four years ago today there came into existence the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, organized for three 
specific purposes. 

PROCLAIMING THE GOSPEL TO THE WORLD 

One to proclaim to the world the restoration of the everlasting 
gospel, in the hour of God's judgment, referred to in the Scriptures 
quoted by the brethren today, and that warning was also to be ac- 
companied with the generous offer of our heavenly Father providing 
means of escape for all men. 

THE SALVATION OF THE DEAD 

Another great obligation that is upon the Church is to provide, 
in the way the Lord has given, through his holy temples, in the 
exercise of the authority of the holy Priesthood, the means, the way, 
whereby even those who are dead may be with us partakers in these 
glorious blessings vicariously performed for and in their behalf, by 
men in the flesh.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



PERFECTING THE LIVES OF MEMBERS 

Then the other great task is purifying and perfecting the lives 
o,: the members of the Church, and building them up in preparation 
to be the people worthy of the King of kings when he shall come. 

AS TO PROCLAIMING THE GOSPEL 

I wish, with all earnestness, my brethren and sisters to direct 
vour attention to the first obligation, the obligation of carrying the 
Gospel to the world. I conceive our heavenly Father as deeply in- 
terested in all these, his children, but it was his way to commune 
with them through his chosen servant, the Prophet Joseph Smith. 
Knowing the calamity which was to come, and out of consideration 
for his children, he sent the warning voice, the message that was 
to be delivered by the angel whom John saw flying through the midst 
of heaven with the everlasting gospel for Earth's children crying: 
Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. That is the message 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is under obligation 
to carry to all the world. And as I have observed, the Lord gave, 
in connection with this warning, the fulness of the Everlasting Gos- 
pel, as the means of saving the world from the perils that were to 
come. I rejoice that so far as this obligation is concerned, we have 
been performing our duty acceptably, I believe, before the Lord, and 
yet the task, is not completed. We have acted as if we were on 
serious business. We have not been indifferent towards the world, 
nor the delivery of this message. We believe that we have a vital 
message for all men. We know it, and we have acted as men who 
did believe it. From the time the first elders of the Church left 
their homes to begin this task, when their families and they were 
outcasts, when chills and fever were raging, the men themselves were 
sick and had to be lifted up into the wagon, and as they were about 
to leave their loved ones, who were sick and afflicted and sorrowing, 
abiding in poor little hovels, temporary quarters, these exiles, gave 
three cheers for Zion, to raise their drooping spirits, and left, making 
these sacrifices, to cross the water to carry this message to the peoples 
of the old world, which the Lord has required of the Church. There 
have followed in their wake thousands of men and hundreds of women, 
and never a dearth of missionaries. We have never seen a time when 
we could not supply, generously, those needed to discharge this obliga- 
tion to the world. 

NOTHING EVER DETERRED THE ELDERS FROM THIS DUTY 

In the time when gold was discovered in California, and the 
whole world was interested and thousands were coming westward 
to seek their fortunes, I suppose it was a matter of great surprise 
to the gold seeker to meet companies of "Mormon" missionaries going 
away from the gold, pushing their little hand-carts, with their few 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 



147 



earthly belongings, to preach the gospel to the peoples of the old world. 
There has never been anything that has deterred the men of this Church 
from performing this sacred obligation. When I think of it, however, 
and recognize the fact that there are yet nations that have not heard 
the Gospel, and the great war through which wc have passed seems 
to me to have prepared in many places the way for delivering the 
message, I am concerned that we shall fulfil our obligation before 
the Lord, within the times he would like to have us do it; and, there- 
fore, we are calling for more help. Great as our sacrifices and service 
have been, the labor is not yet completed, and it must go forward ; we 
cannot stop now. 

MORE EFFORT ASKED IN THIS LINE 

We are asking that there shall be more cooperation on the part 
of the Church members in helping to discharge this obligation. It is 
not the duty and task of the man who happens to have a son, to pay 
his way and to bear the whole burden. Of course he will have to make 
a sacrifice, the sacrifice of his son's time, and means to maintain 
him, but the burden of keeping these representatives in the field 
rests upon every members of the Church, and so there has been ap- 
portioned among the wards a certain number that each ward 
should have in the missionary field, and it is every man's 
duty, in the ward, to see that his representatives are in the field. It 
ought to be indeed a matter of regret, and I was going to say shame 
to any ward that would allow the representatives from that ward to 
come home because perchance their parents have exhausted their means 
and cannot go any further. The wards should rally to the help of 
their representatives and keep them in the missionary field, discharg- 
ing the obligation that rests upon all of us. 

HOW FUNDS MAY BE OBTAINED FOR THIS PURPOSE 

Again, it is splendid to have missionary farewell parties. Some- 
times, however, we have a very successful missionary party, a large 
sum is realized, but the missionary is to go to some nearby mission. 

Then the next missionary farewell party is for one who is going 
to South Africa, or to Germany or elsewhere at a distance, and if it 
happens to be an unfavorable night, a small amount of money is con- 
tributed, not nearly sufficient to take him to his field of labor. We 
feel that the practice adopted by some stakes would be splendid if carried 
out elsewhere. Have your missionary farewell parties contribute liber- 
ally. Let the means, however, go into a fund in the ward from which 
the fare of your missionary to his field of labor, be it long or be it 
short, shall be paid, as the Church does in returning them, and let 
that fund be built up by the contributions of those who have never 
performed missionary service. There are men who could not go be- 
cause of their own business affairs, or because of physical disabilities. 
It would be a splendid thing for every such man to give five dollars, 



148 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ten dollars, fifteen dollars, or twenty-five dollars or more a month for 
two years to such a fund, from which these, our representatives, might 
be sent into the field and assist those in need to remain; for there 
are hundreds of young men in the Church today anxious to go, but 
their finances will not enable them to fully take care of themselves. 

THE GOSPEL THE WORLD'S HOPE 

By a united effort and cooperative spirit we may continue this 
work acceptably to the Church and before the Lord. I feci earnest 
about it because I recognize that it is the world's hope. I recognize 
that there is no salvation for this generation except through the gos- 
pel of the Lord Jesus Christ. I recognize that the Lord has re- 
quired it at our hands, and that it has to be done and done speedily. 
The time may not be so definitely fixed that we know exactly how 
long it shall be, but it has to be done in the period of time known as 
the "times of the Gentiles." It will not last forever ; the time will 
come when the Gentiles will close their doors and no longer wish 
the elders of this Church, when the wheat has been gathered. I expect 
to see that time, but when it does come I want our missionaries to be 
there in force, as a witness before God and all men that we have 
acquitted ourselves honorably and acceptably to the Lord, and that we 
are free from the responsibility that has been upon us, and that the 
obligation has been fully discharged. I believe that our heavenly 
Father is very much like an earthly father in some respects. 

HOW CAN THE CHILDREN OF GOD BE SAVED ? 

What can an earthly father do to save his disobedient boy or 
girl? He can plead with him, he can point out the way of danger 
and the path of safety, just as our heavenly Father, seeing the course 
and the tendency of this generation, leading towards sorrow and 
distress, wonted to save men, and he gave the warning and the way to 
save them. So an earthly father can plead with his son or daughter, 
point out the danger, and the way of safety. He can say : "My 
boy, the course you are taking is going to lead you to bonds and im- 
prisonment, to sorrow and to distress. Turn away from it. But, here 
is the path that will lead you to happiness, to success, to virtue, to 
prosperity. Take this path, rny son." When a father has done that, 
he has nearly reached his limit. If his son takes the wrong course, 
wilfully disobeying his father and mother, that father cannot save 
his boy. The boy comes to bonds and imprisonment, as many are 
today doing, to pay the penalty of their transgressions, with their 
own lives, or a life sentence. There are those who would give their 
lives to save these boys, but they cannot veto the sentence, they cannot 
set it aside ; the law must have its way. Our heavenly Father can 
plead with his sons and his daughters, to abandon the course they 
are taking. He can point out the dangers, and he has always done 
that, whether it was in the days of Noah or now, it has been the same, 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 



149 



he has had the same attitude towards his children, pointing out the 
danger, pleading with them to turn away from that danger, and point- 
ing the path of safety and of success. But if men disregard it, even 
God cannot save them, because he is limited. He must himself obey 
law. He cannot save his sons and his daughters, only inasmuch as they 
repent. We have spoken about the time when Satan shall be bound, 
and will have no more power over the hearts of the children of men. 
How will he be bound? When all men turn away from him and cease 
to follow after him, so far as they are concerned, he will be bound. 
But do you know that we can bind the Lord" also by our wickedness? 
By our own rebellion, we tie his hands, we make him helpless to save us, 
and he cannot do it except men will repent. That being true, recog- 
nizing that the children of men are in peril and are in danger, and the 
only hope — is in the hands of this people, and it is that which is 
known as the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. Ought we not to be 
active, ought we not to be anxious to bring to them the glad news 
that has brought us peace and salvation? 

RESULTS OF THE REJECTION OF THE GOSPEL 

I bear witness to you that there will be, following the rejection 
of the testimony of the servants of the Lord, new f witnesses raised 
up by the Lord — he himself has spoken of it — they shall be the 
thunder, the lightning, the earthquake, the perils by land and by sea, 
famine, plagues, and distress that shall naturally come. As you sow, 
so shall you reap. We do not want to have the world reap that kind 
of harvest. I have no delight in it, for I love the souls of the children 
of men. 

OUR OFFERING TO PREVENT SUCH RESULTS 

How can I help it ? Thirteen years of my life have been .spent in the 
mission field. How could I give that time for men without loving 
them ? I do love them ; yet I recognize that my love for them cannot 
save them. God's love for them cannot save them except they repent. 
Jesus himself, with all the love he had for the children of men, upon the 
Mount of Olives, wept over Jerusalem and said : "Oh, that thou 
wouldst have received the message. How I would have gathered you 
as a hen gathereth her chickens." But they would not. So, my 
brethren and sisters, I speak of our offering to the world with some 
degree of pride. If one hundred thousand dollars has been offered 
by one of our distinguished citizens in this country to produce a 
plan for world peace, we have offered the services of more than sixty 
thousand missionaries, and I have estimated, at a reasonable figure, 
the probable value of their time, and the money sent to them in the 
field and to take them there and bring them back, and this little handful 
of people have contributed, to bring peace to the world, more than 
two hundred millions of dollars in time, service and money. That is 



150 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



our offering, and we have not stopped offering yet. We are on serious 
business. We recognize that this is a stupendous task, for a little 
handful of people to perform, yet we have given our time and 
service freely, out of the love we have for the souls of the children 
of men. 

THE GOSPEL IS THE MESSAGE OF PEACE TO THE WORLD 

But we know as we know that we live, that this is the message of 
peace for this world. Measures, such as offered in the plans of men to 
bring peace to the world, may be good, they are undoubtedly steps to- 
ward the end, but I say to you, there is no plan to settle the world's 
troubles, only as it is found in the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ; 
and when men receive it and repent and are baptized and come under 
the influence of the Holy Ghost, and he becomes the common teacher 
of all men, he will never teach them to go to war with one another, 
but he will soften their hearts, take hatred out of their souls, and the 
spirit of repentance shall come, and love for their fellowmen shall abide. 
All the plans of men cannot duplicate this system of our God. 

OUR MISSION TO WIN THE WORLD FOR CHRIST 

I have no fear for schism and division of this Church, over the 
questions on doctrine that are arising in other churches. Or whether 
modernism or fundamentalism shall ever be a question among us — 
fundamental things in this Church have clearly been established from 
the beginning. And we have continuous revelation that will settle 
all such questions. We are founded upon the truth, that God lives, a real 
being, our Father, that Jesus Christ is his Son, the Only Begotten 
in the flesh, the Firstborn in the spirit, the literal Son of God, and 
the only Savior of mankind. T know it as well as I know that I live; 
you know it ; and we are to tell the world of it and try to win the world 
for Christ. Oh, that we could tell all men ! Oh. that these amplifiers could 
carry today the message to the ears of all flesh, that God has spoken, 
and in an age of the world's dire peril, he has extended his helping 
hand to save them, and if they will but repent and receive the gospel 
of the Lord Jesus Christ, they shall find salvation here and here- 
after. May that message be carried forward and reach all flesh, 
and blessing and honor shall be upon every man and every woman who 
thus contributes to this noble world cause. May it eventually pre- 
vail, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang, "Come, come, ye Saints."

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I will announce that the auditors have made the usual report, 
and reported that they found the books and accounts, and everything 
in the Bishop's Office and the Trustee-in-Trust's in perfect order. 

The Church Stenographer, Brother Frank W. Otterstrom, handed 
me the following, which appeared in last Sunday's issue of the New 
York Times, being a statement made in 1911 by Dr. Eliot, President 
Emeritus of Harvard University : 

"Hozv to live long — Go to Church. Keep a clean heart and a good con- 
science. Give your mind exercise as well as your body — really think. Ex- 
ercise regularly, eat in moderation, take a full allowance of sleep. Avoid in- 
dulgence in luxuries and the habitual use of any drug whatsoever — not only 
of alcohol, but tobacco, tea and coffee." 

In 1833, the Lord told us, in a much more substantial way than 
President Eliot, to refrain from all those things. Among other things,, 
my brethren and sisters, keep the Word of Wisdom. 

I am very pleased to announce that Brother George Albert Smith 
is with us this afternoon oil the stand, but it is scarcely considered 
wisdom for him to attempt to address this vast congregation. 

FOR THE SUFFERERS IN EUROPE 

There was a special drive made during the past season for the 
suffering people in Europe; and in addition, there was a drive made 
for clothes, and we have been able to send four carloads of clothing 
to Europe. The railroad and steamship companies have furnished us 
transportation for these clothes, practically free of charge, for which 
we are grateful indeed. It has been estimated that the cash received, 
$12,500 of which went to the Near East organization, and the clothing, 
would amount, in round numbers, to fully $100,000. Sixty and odd 
thousand dollars was the estimate placed upon the clothing sent. We 
have received word from our European missions that this clothing was 
very good indeed, that they were surprised at the high quality of the 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



153 



clothing that was delivered. There were extensive repairs made on 
the shoes that were given, which made them very much more acceptable. 
This assistance has been rendered to the Netherlands and Germany, 
to the Armenians, and also the Near East, as stated, and some assist- 
ance also to Great Britain. 

PROGRESS AND INCREASE IN MANY CHURCH ACTIVITIES 

There has been a substantial increase in the attendance at our 
sacrament meetings during the past year. There has been better ward- 
teaching and an increase in the number of families visited monthly ; sta- 
tistics show an increase in our tithes, a large increase in the number 
of tithe-payers, and a splendid record of the stake and ward officers 
in the payment of tithes, for which we are grateful. 

An extensive building program is being carried out in many 
of the stakes of Zion. New meeting-houses are being erected and the 
people are very liberal in their donations for the same. 

In the conservation of life, the records show a marked decrease 
in the deaths of children under five years of age, showing that better 
methods are being adopted all through the state to prevent our little 
ones from passing away in their infancy. 

For the first time, more people have removed to the missions 
of the Church from the stakes of Zion than have been received from 
the missions. A splendid work is being done, as I announced here at 
the opening of our conference, by the missionaries in every part of 
the world. 

It is estimated that there have been 1200 converts to the Church 
as a result of our home missionary work in the various stakes of 
Zion. 

The work of increasing the accomodations in the Salt Lake temple 
has been completed, and has proved a. great convenience to those at- 
tending this temple. The facilities have been very greately enlarged 
and are highly appreciated by those who are working in that temple. 

The Manti temple has been thoroughly overhauled and renovated. 

The frame-work of the Arizona temple is now completed and the 
terra-cotta is being delivered. The building is to be covered with 
terra-cotta — the same general style of covering as the Hotel Utah. 
The walls will be completed within a few months. 

CONDITION IN THE MISSIONS 

There is a marked improvement in the conditions for missionary 
work in Great Britain. The Netherlands mission is very prosperous, 
having very many investigators. A French mission has just been 
created, comprising the French people in the devastated regions of 
France, the French-speaking people of Belgium, and the French-speak- 
ing people of Switzerland. 

In the Scandinavian missions we are still having difficulty in 
getting people into Sweden. I regret that the present condition is 



154 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



altogether different from what it was in the clays of King Oscar. It 
fell to my happy lot, with Brother Alex Nibley, whom I see here, 
and some of my friends, to have the privilege of calling on King- 
Oscar on the 4th day of July, many years ago. With characteristic 
American assurance, I presented myself at the king's palace and re- 
quested an interview and the man who came to the door looked 
at me as if he thought I was crazy, not to be properly pre- 
sented through the minister plenipotentiary. I wrote a letter of intro- 
duction to his majesty and enclosed a letter from Governor Heber 
M. Wells of the state of Utah, told him that day, July 4th, was the 
day that we Americans celebrate, and asked for an audience ; and added 
that I knew that I ought to be presented in proper order, that I had 
letters from the Utah senators to our minister ; but, the day being 
the 4th of July, we hoped that he would waive all of the customary 
formalities necessary to ,see a king. And he very kindly consented, 
stepped out of the palace, and greeted us ; and after learning that only 
two or three in our party understood the Swedish language, he im- 
mediately changed to faultless English, perfect English. He was a 
magnificent specimen of humanity, standing over six feet high. lie 
made this remark to me : "Mr. Grant, I have sent my personal rep- 
resentatives, unknown to the people, to nearly every state in the 
Union of the United States, to find out how my former subjects are 
getting along, how they are prospering; and in no other state in 
the Union are the former subjects of Sweden and Norway more con- 
tented, more prosperous and happier than in Utah ; and, as long as 
I am king of Norway and Sweden, your people shall have religious 
liberty, notwithstanding all the priests and religious denominations 
are against you." I wish he was still alive. 

An extensive building program is now in operation in many of 
the missions of the United States. Meeting houses of a substantial 
character have been erected in some of the missions — in far off New 
Zealand, in Australia, and in some other places. We are grateful 
for the very excellent progress that we are making all over the world 
in our missionary work. 

WORK OF THE M. I. A. SCOUTS 

Some remarks have been made here, telling of the good opinion 
that people have of us today, in comparison with what it used to be. 
It fell to my lot to be at a Boy Scout gathering at the West-side 
High school, where representatives from this section of the country 
were present. President Moore, the head of the great World's Fair 
at San Francisco, was one of these men, Stewart French was another, 
and other influential national representatives were there. One of the 
men present upon that occasion was George J. Fisher, who is the 
second in command of the Boy Scouts of America. The man in charge, 
the head man, Mr. West, was with us in this building about a year 
ago. and he delivered a magnificent address and paid splendid com- 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



155 



pliments to our people. lie remarked to me that it was a great pleasure 
to him to have nominated Oscar A. Kirkham to have charge of the 
Boy Scouts who went to Europe — a great compliment, I feel to the 
American people. Oscar A. Kirkham has received a letter from Dr. 
George J. Fisher, which I think every Latter-day Saint would like to 
hear read. Every Latter-day Saint ought to have read it, because, 
in every Latter-day Saint home there ought to be the Improvement 
Era. But, for fear there is not one in every home of those who are 
here, I will read this from the March number of the Improvement 
Era : 

"Tt was my pleasure recently to meet the representatives of the Boy 
Scout movement in Utah and to observe Scouting in action. 

"I was deeply impressed not only with the extent to which the boys of 
Utah had been reached, but with the quality of the program of Scouting which 
was being conducted. 

"Utah excels in Scouting. Tn Salt Lake City and in Logan, the head- 
quarters of two Councils of the State, I witnessed actual demonstrations by the 
boys themselves. 

"I was profoundly moved and greatly inspired by what T saw. Utah excels 
in the number of boys reached in proportion to the population. In many com- 
munities practically all of the boys available are scouts. There are more boys 
of advanced rank and a greater percentage of Eagle scouts than in any other 
section of America. 

"Scouting reaches the boys not only in the large centers of the state, but 
in the remotest villages. 

"So well is scouting administered that the boys themselves manage much 
of their activities under wise adult guidance. 

"I saw a great rally directed entirely by scouts in Salt Lake City. The 
dispatch, precision, efficiency and spirit with which they conducted the affair 
was worthv of high praise. I have never seen it excelled. 

"Scouting is raising up a fine breed of boys in Utah. Tt is giving them 
splendid executive training that will fit them for effective leadership in the 
affairs of state in the years immediately ahead. 

"Scouting is a course in the practice of patriotism. Tt is developing 
patriots in Utah, yes. boys who will be felt in the public and private life of 
the nation. 

"That state is a great state which gives to its youth its first attention. 
Utah excels in that regard. 

"The secret of it all is that splendid, high motived men are giving 
themselves unselfishly to the boys of the state. This is the way to success 
and real achievement. 

"These men are taking serious training for their tasks. I associated 
for part of two days with almost a hundred of them in training at the State 
Agricultural College at Logan. They came from the remotest parts of 
the state and of nearby states. Tt was an inspiration. 

"These men will determine the standards of boy life in the state. It 
is a noble enterprise, a worthy and commendable service. All praise to 
them. 

. "These scouts in the stat^ are catching and demonstrating the spirit 
of Scouting. It is a great spiritual crusade. They are living the Scout 
Oath and Laws. They are practicing the 'daily good turn.' 

"Scouting is reaching all boys: poor boys as well as those who are more 
favored. Utah is setting standards for the whole country. Utah is repeat- 
ing historv. Just as she developed the early scouts, the great heroes of 
pioneer days, so now she is raising up boy scouts, caught by the same

spirit of enterprise, by the same spirit of adv.enture. It is the pioneer spirit, 
the holy crusade of olden days applied in practical, yet romantic fashion 
to the youth of this later age. 

"The 'Mormon' Church is the large.st factor in this splendid achievement. 
She it is that is furnishing men and vision and ideals to the young men 
throughout the state, and they as scoutmasters in the great majority are 
inspiring the youth of the state to become good scouts. Splendid co- 
operation is given by other religious agencies in this work. 

"And for this good service we are deeply grateful. Scouting is marching 
on in Utah, an excellent example to all the nation." 

PRESIDENT BRIGHAM YOUNG'S ADMONITION SEVENTY-ONE YEARS AGO 

APPLIES TODAY 

October 6 to 9, 1853: Words of President Brigham Young: 

"We will now bring our conference to a close. I wish the Latter- 
day Saints to hearken to the counsel they receive from time to time, 
and especially to the counsel I will now give to all Latter-day Saints in 
this house, in the valleys of the mountains, and to all who are scattered 
among the nations of the earth. I ask one thing at your hands, and that is, 
to live your religion day by day. 

"The religion we profess is the religion of the Lord J.esus Christ; a religion 
of revelation, ministering of angels, and tire power of God on the people through 
ithe ordinances of God. My counsel is, to live their religion. If they do, they 
will live watchfully, prayerfully, humbly; and their hearts will be filled with 
compassion one towards another, and they will seek to do good all the days 
of their lives ; and when an evil is presented to them they will shun that evil, 
and will cleave to that which is right before the Lord ; otherwise they will 
brinp- disgrace upon themselves, and dishonor their religion. This is my counsel 
to all Saints, and I wish you to carry it from this conference to your neigh- 
bors, and spread it. abroad, throughout all the churches of the Saints, upon 
the face of the whole earth; — Live the religion you profess!" 

Brother Junius F. Wells was indexing some of the Journals of 
Discourses and ran across the above and handed it to me ; and I felt 
I would like to read it here. 

THE SUGAR INDUSTRY 

I am very happy to inform the Latter-day Saints that there has 
been a very wonderful and remarkable "come-back" in the sugar in- 
dustry of this inter-mountain country. Instead of the various sugar 
factories being in debt many, many millions of dollars of money to 
the banks in New York and Chicago, with large stocks of .sugar on 
hand and no sale for it, there is now a demand for sugar through- 
out the entire country ; and almost without exception, if not without 
exception, (I am not thoroughly posted) the companies are not in 
debt to bankers who were unwilling three years ago, without ad- 
ditional capital being invested, to renew obligations that they held. 
Today, most if not all of the companies are free from bank obliga- 
tions in the East and the industry has come back in a splendid way ; 
for which we are grateful. The farmers are giving loyal support and 
raising larger quantities of beets, which means an increased product, 
which means an increase of prosperity to this intermountain country. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



157 



GIVE LOYAL SUPPORT TO HOME INSTITUTIONS 

From my earliest recollection, I have heard Brigham Young and 
all of his successors preach to the people and beg them to support and 
sustain all of the various industries that were established throughout 
this inter-mountain country ; and I appeal to the Latter-day Saints 
today, to all who are here present, to carry the message to the people 
throughout the entire Church — to support the institutions of our state, 
to be loyal to those institutions through which employment can be 
given to the people, and from which you can secure articles that are 
manufactured here at home. Give them the preference ; help to build 
up our country ; sustain this inter-mountain country. We need sup- 
port for everything that is started in the nature of a manufacturing 
institution in this country. We are so far away from the centers of 
consumption for many of our products that railroad freight charges 
prevent us exporting many goods which, but for the long distance to 
the markets, we could do. Therefore, let us be loyal to our institutions 
here at home. 

BUILDING OF THE ARIZONA TEMPLE PROGRESSING 

I am pleased to inform you that it has fallen to my lot, during 
the past six months, to visit Arizona and to see the progress that is 
jbeing made there upon our temple; and I am sure that when that 
building is completed we shall all be proud of it. I am sure that it 
will be one more monument testifying to the faith and the loyalty of 
the Latter-day Saints to the work of the Lord and to the message that 
has come to us in our day — to labor for the redemption of our dead. 
'1 am sure that it will be a credit to our people that will be recognized 
hy those not of our faith, in seeing one more splendid monument of 
the kind and this in the state of Arizona. 

INCREASED TESTIMONY AND FRESH INSPIRATION FROM READING THE 

BOOK OF MORMON 

I have rejoiced during the past six or seven weeks in reading 
carefully through, at the rate of about ten pages a day, with a prayerful 
heart, the Book of Mormon. I do not think that I have ever before en- 
joyed that book so much. I do not think the wonderful testimonies con- 
tained in it regarding the divine mission of the Savior, have ever 
made a more profound impression upon my heart and soul than they 
have made this last time that I have read the Book of Mormon. I 
remember, and have often spoken of the fact of reading it in my 
youthful days, and how there came into my heart an abiding testi- 
mony that that book was true, that it was in very deed exactly what 
it purports to be — the .sacred history of the forefathers of the 
American Indian. I could not as a child or as a young man, com- 
prehend and understand as fully as today the splendid discourses 
regarding the divine mission of the Savior. His wonderful teachings 
to the people upon this continent, the wonderful inspired teachings 



158 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

of Alma and Abinadi and many others, as contained in that book. 
But I am thankful beyond .expression that I did read the book in 
my boyhood days and that the assurance came into my heart that it was 
in very deed the truth, and that I fell in love with the character 
of Nephi. More than any other mortal man that we have any record 
of in the Bible, the Old, or the New Testaments, or in the Book of 
Mormon, more, I believe, than- the influence of my friends and as- 
sociates with whom I have lived, Nephi has made an impression upon 
my heart and my soul and has been one of the guiding stars of 
my life — a man who endeavored upon all occasions never to become 
discouraged or disheartened, never to complain ; but who endeavored 
to the full extent of his ability to carry out his own wonderful words 
spoken to his father — 

"I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, 
for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children 
of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish 
the thing which he commanded them." 

That remarkable declaration, exemplified through his entire life, 
has stayed with me, I am sure, now for fully fifty long years ; and 
I rejoice in the fact of the impression that was made upon my heart 
and soul by that statement. I also rejoice in his immediately ex- 
emplifying the .statement that he would do what the Lord required. 
What had the Lord required? The Lord, through Lehi, his father, 
had received a dream to the effect that his sons were to return to 
Jerusalem and secure the brass plates upon which some of the ancient 
scriptures and the genealogy of tbe forefathers of Nephi were recorded. 
And his brethren were complaining, when he made that impressive 
announcement that he would go and do the thing which the Lord had 
required. 

They made a failure of their first attempt, and his brothers de- 
sired to return to their father in the wilderness, but Nephi said : 

"We will not go down unto our father in the wilderness until we have 
accomplished the thing which the Lord hath commanded us." 

And they went up again to Jerusalem, and they gathered their 
riches and they offered them to Laban for the record. Instead of 
making the exchange, Lallan sent his servants to kill them, and he 
stole their wealth. Nephi's brothers then commenced beating him, 
and an angel of the Lord appeared and told them to go up again 
unto Jerusalem and the Lord would deliver Laban into their hands, 
and they would obtain the plates. 

No sooner had the angel disappeared than these men, lacking in 
faith — and men that do not keep the commandments of the Lord are 
always lacking in faith and always will be lacking in faith, and always 
will find fault ; and those who are perpetually .seeking for some great 
and wonderful manifestation will never amount to very much in the 
Church ; while those who keep the commandments of God never find 
fault, they have faith, they believe — these brothers of Nephi said : 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



159 



"How is it possible that the Lord will deliver Laban into our hands? 
Behold he is a mighy man, and he can command fifty, yea, even he 
can slay fifty; then why not us?" And the answer of Nephi was: 
"Let us be faithful in keeping the commandments of the Lord ; for 
behold he is mightier than all the earth, then why not mightier than 
Laban and his fifty, yea, or even than his tens of thousands?" 

Many men say : "If I could only see an angel, if I could only 
hear an angel proclaim something, that would cause me to be faith- 
ful all the days of my life!" It had no effect upon these men that were 
not serving the Lord, and it would have no effect today. 

As I say, I rejoice in the increased testimony that has come 
into my heart and soul regarding the divinity of the Book of Mormon, 
in the reading that I have just completed while on my recent trip to 
the south. 

THE TERRIBLE CATASTROPHE AT CASTLE GATE 

We have had one of the most terrible caiastrophies in the history 
of the state of Utah, on which occasion one hundred seventy-three, 
as I remember it, lives were lost in the Castle Gate coal mine explosion. 
It fell to my lot, with Elder Richard R. Lyman and others, to visit 
Castle Gate and to see the effects of that terrible calamity there. The 
Governor of the state and others have inaugurated a drive for the 
benefit of the families that have been left destitute of a provider. I 
hope and pray that in every hamlet, and in every home there will be 
a disposition to contribute something toward this great drive for the 
benefit of the families of the men who were killed in that great dis- 
aster. There is nothing truer than the statement in ancient writ that 
"It is more blessed to give than to receive," and I say that the greater 
blessing will come to those who give than to those who are not willing 
to give in this case. Let us do our part, as we have ever done our 
part in all of the various calls that have been made by our nation 
in times of trouble and by those in distress. I am sure that the ap- 
peal will not be made in vain. The Church has been solicited to assist 
and we have contributed $2,500 of the tithing funds for this purpose, 
which was somewhat more than the request made by the chairman who 
called upon us. 

THE SAINTS LOVE THE GOSPEL, AS WITNESS THE CONFERENCE 
ATTENDANCE 

I have been very pleased indeed, my brethren and sisters, with 
the wonderful attendance at our conference. We have never had 
anything like it within my recollection, nothing to compare with the 
wonderful outpouring of the people at these conference meetings. To 
have our week-day meetings so crowded in this tabernacle that many 
have had to stand up is a new experience, and it shows to me that 
the Latter-day Saints are awake, that they are alive, that they have 



160 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



a love of the gospel, that they are anxious to come here to par- 
take of the spirit of our conferences, that spirit which has been with 
the Latter-day Saints, in this building, from the very day it was first 
opened. It has fallen to my lot, from my childhood days until now, 
excepting when I have been absent from the state upon foreign mis- 
sions, to attend conferences in this building twice a year, and I have 
never come into this building and been disappointed; I have never 
come here but what I have been benefited and fed with the bread 
of life and built up in the faith, and strengthened in my knowledge 
and testimony regarding the divinity of the work in which we as 
Latter-day Saints are engaged. 

PRAYER FOR THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 

I pray that the Lord will bless the President of the United States 
of America and his cabinet, and that he will vindicate the President 
and every honest member of his cabinet; and I believe that there are 
honest, upright, God-fearing, patriotic men in the cabinet of President 
Coolidge. I believe he is a man worthy of the blessings of Almighty 
God. That is my opinion of the President of the United States. I 
believe that he has the welfare of the people of this great country at 
heart. 

BLESSINGS ON ALL ISRAEL, AT HOME AND ABROAD 

I pray that the Lord will bless each and everyone of the Latter- 
day Saints throughout all the stakes of Zion, from Canada on the north 
to Mexico on the south. I pray that he will bless the Saints all 
over the wide world, in all the different missions, that they may 
grow and increase in the light and the knowledge and the testimony of 
the gospel of Jesus Christ. 

I bear my witness to you here today that God lives, that Jesus 
is the Christ, the Savior of the world, the Redeemer of mankind, 
that Joseph Smith was a prophet of the true and the living God, and 
that each man, woman and child who lives the gospel of Jesus 
Christ shall find life eternal in the presence of our heavenly Father. 

I pray for the blessings of the Lord to abide with all Israel, and 
I do it in the name of Jesus Christ, our Redeemer. Amen. 

The choir sang, "Then shall your light shine." 

Elder Orson F. Whitney, of the Council of the Twelve, of- 
fered the benediction, and the conference adjourned for six months. 

Professor Anthony C. Lund conducted the singing, assisted by 
Professor B. Cecil Gates. Edward P. Kimball played the accompani- 
ments, interludes, etc. on the great organ, assisted by Tracy Y. Can- 
non. Professor J. J. McClellan was absent on account of illness. 

Stenographic reports of the discourses were made in the taber- 
nacle by Franklin W. Otterstrom, assisted by Joseph Anderson ; and 
in the assembly hall by Frederick E. Barker. 

Edward H. Anderson, clerk of the conference.

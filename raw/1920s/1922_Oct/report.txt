GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Jensen, Canada ; and Benjamin Goddard, Bureau of Information, 
Temple Block, Salt Lake City. 

The Tabernacle was filled, all the seats being occupied both in 
the gallery and in the body of the house. People from all parts of 
the Church were present. 

The choir and congregation sang, "Come, come, ye Saints, no 
toil nor labor fear." 

The opening prayer was offered by Elder S. Norman Lee, presi- 
dent of the Box Elder stake of Zion. 

The choir and congregation sang, "Do what is right, the daydawn 
is breaking." 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

It is a source of great pleasure and satisfaction to me to see such 
a magnificent audience here today, almost completely filling this 
house. I am sure that those who are standing in the gallery and on 
the south side of the building, by a little closing up on the part of 
the audience, could all have a seat. I have no recollection of ever 
seeing an audience here on a week day, in the opening of our con- 
ference, where there were so many people standing when we com- 
menced speaking. There could be no greater evidence of the interest of 
the Latter-day Saints than is shown by this great outpouring of people 
at the first meeting of our General Conference, and I am grateful to 
all those who are here assembled. I know you have come here with a 
desire to be fed the bread of life. I have no desire whatever to say 
anything to you this morning except that which may be for your bene- 
fit, as well as for my own. 

ENGAGED FOR MANY YEARS IN PROCLAIMING THE GOSPEL 

Forty years ago this October conference, I met the late Elder 
George Teasdale of the Council of the Twelve, at the south gate, and 
he shook hands with me and said : "Brother Grant, I am delighted 
to see you. You and I are going to be" — and he stopped suddenly 
and his face turned red; but the Lord gave me the balance of the 
sentence. Four times in my life I have been permitted to read the 
thoughts of people. The balance of Brother Teasdale's sentence was — 
"sustained this afternoon as apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ to fill 
the vacancies in the Quorum," and that went through me 
like a shock of electricity. I came to the Sunday afternoon meet- 
ing of the conference, because of this partial sentence, and the bal- 
ance that was given to me, with the assurance in my heart that Brother 
Teasdale and myself would be sustained as apostles. Those of you 
who were at that conference remember that it adjourned without fill- 
ing those vacancies. I do not believe that any mortal man ever more 
humbly supplicated God during the next few days to forgive him for 
his egotism than I did for thinking that I was to be chosen as an

apostle. As you are aware, within a week a revelation came to 
John Taylor calling Brother Teasdale and myself to those positions. 
For forty years I have been engaged in proclaiming the gospel of 
the Lord Jesus Christ and bearing witness to my knowledge that 
God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, the Savior of the world, that 
Joseph Smith is a prophet of the true and the living God. I have had 
the privilege of bearing that testimony in nearly every state of the 
Union, in Canada on the north, in Mexico on the south, in the Hawai- 
ian Islands, in far-off Japan, in England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, 
Germany, Holland, Belgium, Switzerland, France, Italy, Norway, Swe- 
den, and Denmark, and I have had exceeding great joy, during all of 
those forty years, in bearing this testimony. 

I was undecided in my mind, before coming to this meeting which 
of the many things that I had read in the Book of Mormon and in 
the Doctrine and Covenants I would speak upon. The only question was : 
Which is the one theme to present? I have no hesitancy now as to 
the thing to talk about, because the opening prayer was on the identi- 
cal subject of the first item that I read this morning in the Doctrine 
and Covenants, and that was to sustain and to uphold the laws of the 
land. 

BELIEF OF THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS ON GOVERNMENT AND 
LAWS IN GENERAL 

I have been criticized, time and time again, by friends and others, 
and have had much splendid advice given to me not to read so much 
in public because nothing could be more tiresome to an audience than 
reading; but I am not here for the purpose of saying something to 
tickle your ears or to please you, but I am here with a prayer in my 
heart to say those things that shall be for your best good and benefit, 
and mine also. I honestly believe that it will be for our best good to 
hear every word of an entire section of the Doctrine and Covenants 
which is: 

"A Declaration of Belief regarding Governments and Laws in general, 
adopted by unanimous vote at a general assembly of the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints, held at Kirtland, Ohio, August 17, 1S35." (Section 134.) 

"We believe that governments were instituted of God for the benefit of 
man ; and that he holds men accountable for their acts in relation to them, both 
in making laws and administering them, for the good and safety of society. 

"We believe that no government can exist in peace, except such laws are 
framed and held inviolate as will secure to each individual the free exercise 
of conscience, the right and control of property, and the protection of life." 
(And that means the right to labor without taking the chance of being killed.) 

"We believe that all governments necessarily require civil officers and 
magistrates; to enforce the laws of the same ; and that such as will administer 
the law in equity and justice should be sought for and upheld by the voice 
of the people (if a republic) or the will of the sovereign. 

"We believe that religion is instituted of God ; and that men are amenable 
to him, and to him only, for the exercise of it, unless their religious opinions

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



prompt them to infringe upon the rights and liberties of others ; but we do not 
believe that human law has a right to interfere in prescribing rules of wor- 
ship to bind the consciences of men, nor dictate forms for public or private 
devotion; that the civil magistrate should restrain crime, but never control 
conscience ; should punish guilt, but never suppress the freedom of the soul. 

"We believe that all men are bound to sustain and uphold the respective 
governments in which they reside, while protected in their inherent and in- 
alienable rights by the laws of such governments ; and that sedition and re- 
bellion are unbecoming every citizen thus protected, and should be punished 
accordingly; and that all governments have a right to enact such laws as in 
their own judgments are best calculated to secure the public interest; at the 
same time, however, holding sacred the freedom of conscience. 

"We believe that every man should be honored in his station, rulers and 
magistrates as such, being placed for the protection of the innocent and the 
punishment of the guilty; and that to the laws all men owe respect and defer- 
ence, as without them peace and harmony would be supplanted by anarchy 
and terror; human laws being instituted for the express purpose of regulating 
our interests as individuals and nations, between man and man ; and divine 
laws given of heaven, prescribing rules on spiritual concerns, for faith and 
worship, both to be answered by man to his Maker. 

"We believe that rulers, states, and governments have a right, and are 
bound to enact laws for the protection ,of all citizens in the free exercise of 
their religious belief; but we do not believe that they have a right in justice 
to deprive citizens of this privilege, or proscribe them in their opinions, so 
long as a regard and reverence are shown to the laws and such religious 
opinions do not justify sedition nor conspiracy. 

"We believe that the commission of crime should be punished according to 
the nature of the offense; that murder, treason, robbery, theft, and the .breach 
of the general peace, in all respects, should be punished according to their crim- 
inality, and their tendency to evil among men, by the laws of that govern- 
ment in which the offense is committed; and for the public peace and tranr 
quility, all men should step forward and use their ability in bringing offenders 
against good laws to punishment. 

"We do not believe it just to mingle religious influence with civil gov- 
ernment, whereby one religious society is fostered and another proscribed in its 
spiritual privileges, and the individual rights of its members, as citizens, denied. 

"We believe that a'l religious societies have a right to deal with their mem- 
bers for disorderly conduct, according to the rules and regulations of such so- 
cieties ; provided that such dealings be for fellowship and good standing; but 
we do not believe that any religious society has authority to try men on the 
right of property or life, to take from them this world's goods, or to put them 
in jeopardy of either life or limb, or to inflict any physical punishment upon 
them. They can only excommunicate them from their society, and withdraw 
from them their fellowship. 

"We believe that men should appeal to the civil law for redress of all 
wrongs and grievances, where personal abuse is inflicted, or the right of prop- 
erty or character infringed, where such laws exist as will protect the same; but 
we believe that all men are justified in defending themselves, their friends, 
ana property, and the government, from the unlawful assaults and encroach- 
ments of all persons in times of exigency, where immediate appeal cannot be 
made to the laws, and relief afforded. 

"We believe it just to preach the gospel to the nations of the earth, and 
warn the righteous to save themselves from the corruption of the world ; but 
we do not believe it right to interfere wih bond-servants, neither preach the 
gospel to, nor baptize them, contrary to the will and wish of their masters, nor 
to meddle with or influence them in the least, to cause them to be dissatisfied 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



with their situation in this life, thereby jeopardizing the lives of men; such 
interference we believe to be unlawful and* unjust, and dangerous to the peace 
of every government allowing human beings to be held in servitude." 

DUTY OF THE SAINTS TO SUSTAIN AND LIVE THE LAW 

I endorse with all my heart this declaration sustained by the 
unanimous vote of the general conference in 1835. I am convinced 
beyond the shadow of a doubt that it is the duty of every Latter-day 
Saint to sustain and live the law. I believe that every Latter-day Saint 
who has any idea in his or her heart that some law has been passed 
that is not a righteous law, after it has been fought out in the courts 
and has been decided, whatever the decision may be, by the highest 
tribunal of our great and glorious country, the Supreme Court of 
the United States, that it is his duty to obey such law. I believe that 
every Latter-day Saint — and by the way no man is a Latter-day Saint 
who drinks whisky — but any "Mormon" who drinks whisky today 
knows that he is in condemnation before the Lord Almighty, whether 
he is the one who bought the whisky, or whether he is simply a par- 
taker of it. I believe that every Latter-day' Saint owes it to himself 
to uphold and sustain what is known as the cigarette law, and I be- 
lieve that we as a people should know by the announcement of every 
man; who is to be elected to the legislature, that he will stand for that 
law, and if he will not so announce himself, if his opponent, no' matter 
what his politics may be, will stand for that law, that we ought to bury 
our politics and vote for the man favoring the retaining and enforcing 
of the cigarette law. 

BEST MEN SHOULD BE CHOSEN REGARDLESS OF POLITICS 

Politics reminds me very much of the measles. The measles don't 
hurt much if you will take a little saffron tea or something else to 
keep them on the surface, but if they once set in on you, they turn 
your hide yellow and sometimes make you cross-eyed. So do not let 
politics set in on you. I believe absolutely in the best men for office. 
I believe in honest, upright, good men being chose to occupy places 
and positions in the state and in the Church. 

THE SAINTS BELIEVE IN THE WORDS OF THE PROPHET JOSEPH 

We testify to all the world that Joseph Smith met the Creator of 
heaven and earth. We testify to all the world that in answer to the 
question asked of God, as to which of all the various religions in 
the world had the truth, that God pointed to his son, Jesus Christ, 
and announced that he was his well beloved Son and said: "Hear 
him," and that the Savior of the world told Joseph Smith to join 
none of them. We believe that the man who promulgated these state- 
ments regarding government and laws was a prophet of the living 
God. We believe the statements made in the section following what 
I have read to you — and by the way, as I am not here to please you, 
I will also read Section 135 :

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



"Martyrdom of Joseph Smith the Prophet, and his brother, Hyrum Smith 
the Patriarch, at Carthage, Illinois, June 27, 1844. 

"To seal the testimony of this book and the Book of Mormon, we an- 
nounce the martyrdom of Joseph Smith the Prophet, and Hyrum Smith the 
Patriarch. They were shot in Carthage jail, on the 27th of June, 1844, about 
five o'clock p. m., by an armed mob — painted black — of from 150 to 200 per- 
sons. Hyrum was shot first and fell calmly, exclaiming: I am a dead man! 
Joseph leaped from the window, and was shot dead in the attempt, exclaim- 
ing: O Lord, my God! They were both shot after they were dead, in a 
brutal manner, and both received four balls. 

"John Taylor and Willard Richards, two of the Twelve, were the only 
persons in the room at the time; the former was wounded in a savage man- 
ner with four balls, but has since recovered; the latter, through the provi- 
dence of God, escaped, without even a hole in his robe. 

"Joseph Smith, the Prophet and Seer of the Lord, has done more, 
save Jesus only, for the salvation of men in this world, than any other 
man that ever liyed in it. In the short space of twenty years, he has 
brought forth the Book of Mormon, which he translated by the gift and 
power 1 of God, and has been the means of publishing it on two con- 
tinents; has sent the fulness of the everlasting gospel, which it contained, 
to the four quarters of the earth; has brought forth the revelations and 
commandments which compose this book of Doctrine and Covenants, and 
many other wise documents and instructions for the benefit of the chil- 
dren of men; gathered many thousands of the Latter-day Saints, founded 
a great city, and left a fame and name that cannot be slain. He lived 
great, and he died great in the eyes of God and his people; and like most 
of the Lord's anointed in ancient times, has sealed his mission and his 
works with his own blood; and so has his brother Hyrum. In life they were 
not divided, and in death they were not separated! 

"When Joseph went to Carthage to deliver himself up to the pretended 
requirements of the law, two or three days previous to his assassination, 
he said: 'I am going like a lamb to the slaughter; but I am calm as a 
summer's morning; I have a conscience void of offense towards God, and 
towards all men. I shall die innocent, and it shall yet be said of me — he 
was murdered in cold blood.'" (And that is said of him all over the world, 
whether by members of the Church or not, who are familiar with all the 
circumstances. A more dastardly, outrageous murder was never before 
committed in the world.) 

"The same morning, after Hyrum had made ready to go— shall it be 
said to the slaughter? yes, for so it was — he read the following paragraph, 
near the close of the twelfth chapter of Ether, in the Book of Mormon, 
and turned down the leaf upon it: 

" 'And it came to pass that I prayed unto the Lord that he would give 
unto the Gentiles grace, that they might have charity. And it came to 
pass that the Lord said unto me: If they have not charity it mattereth not 
unto thee, thou hast been faithful; wherefore thy garments are clean. And 
because thou hast seen thy weakness, thou shalt be made strong, even 
unto the sitting down in the place which I have prepared in the mansions 
of my Father. And now I * * * bid farewell unto the Gentiles; yea, 
and also unto my brethren whom I love, until we shall meet before the 
judgment-seat of Christ, where all men shall know that my garments are 
not spotted with yor blood.' The testators are now dead, anld their testament 
is' in force." 



My mother, as»a young woman, lived in Nauvoo for years. She 
assured me that no more God-fearing, upright mortal ever trod the

earth than Hyrum Smith, the Patriarch, and I have no doubt what- 
ever as to the absolute exaltation of Joseph and Hyrum in the presence 
of the Lord. I have no doubt that these two men are assisting in 
directing, by the power that they have on the other side, the work of 
God here on the earth, notwithstanding their martyrdom. 

"Hyrum Smith was forty-four years old in February, 1844, and Joseph 
Smith was thirty-eight in December, 1843 ; and henceforward their names will 
be classed among the martyrs of religion; and the reader in every nation will 
be reminded that the Book of Mormon, and this book ,of Doctrine and Cove- 
nants of the Church, cost the best blood of the nineteenth century to bring 
them forth for the salvation pf a ruined world; and that if the fire can scathe 
a green tree for the glory of God, how easy it will burn up the dry trees to 
purify thej vineyard of corruption. They lived for glory; they died for glory; 
artd glory is their eternal reward. From age to age shall their names go 
down to posterity as gems for the sanctified. 

"They were innocent of any crime, as they had often been proved before, 
and were only confined in jail by the conspiracy of traitors and wicked men; 
and their innocent blood on the floor of Carthage jail is a broad seal affixed 
to 'Mormonism' that cannot be rejected by any court on earth, and their in- 
nocent blood on the escutcheon of the State of Illinois, with the broken faith 
of the State as pledged by the governor, is a witness to the truth of the ever- 
lasting gospel that all the world cannot impeach ; and their innocent blood on 
the banner of liberty, and on the magna charta of the United States, is an 
ambassador for the religion of Jesus Christ, that will touch the hearts of 
honest men among all nations ; and their innocent blood, with the innocent 
blood of all the martyrs under the altar that John saw, will cry unto the Lord of 
Hosts till he avenges that blood on the earth." 

THIS AUDIENCE A TESTIMONY TO THE DIVINITY OF THE CHURCH 

I have understood that this splendid account of the martyrdom of 
Joseph and Hyrum Smith was written by President John Taylor, 
known as the "Champion of Liberty" who received four shots in his 
body and who lived carrying some of those bullets to his grave, and 
who, years after the martyrdom, stood before the people in this stand 
as the President, Prophet, Seer and Revelator of the Church of Jesus 
Christ. Men may conspire, men may work against the Church of 
God again established upon the earth, but the statement here made 
that no man, saving Jesus Christ himself, has done more for the sal- 
vation of humanity than did Joseph Smith, cannot be controverted. I 
am at the defiance of the world tot have any religious people, I do not 
care where you go, with no more members than the Latter-day Saints 
have, to call a conference of the people and have such a splendid 
audience as there is here today. This very audience is a testimony to 
every living soul who stops to reflect upon it, that God has in very 
deed, through the instrumentality of Joseph Smith, established again 
upon the earth the plan of life and salvation ; that Jesus Christ did 
direct him. All the disbelief of all the world that God and" Jesus 
Christ spoke to him, cannot change the fact, if it is a fact — and God 
has given to me, to hundreds and thousands, and tens of thousands of 
his children, from the country of the Midnight Sun, Scandinavia, clear

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



down to South Africa, all over Europe, from Canada to South America, 
and all over the Islands of the sea, an absolute witness by the Holy 
Spirit that Joseph Smith is in very deed a Prophet of the living God. 

FALSEHOODS STILL PROMULGATED COCERNING THE CHURCH 

Allow me to read a news clipping sent me in a letter by former 
Governor John C. Cutler. He says : "I thought the annexed clipping 
would be information to you, as it was to me" : 

"MORMON LEADER POLITICAL BOSS SAYS REFORMER 

(Exclusive Dispatch) 

"Winona Lake (Ind.) August 9. — The most powerful political private 
individual in America today is H. J. Grant, head of the 'Mormon' Kingdom," 
declared Dr. James S. Martin of Pittsburg, superintendent of the National 
Reform Association, in addressing the annual Christian Citizenship Institute 
here today. "Twenty-six years ago," he continued, "there was not a principal 
man in all 'Mormondom' who had even s,o much as a vote. All had been dis- 
franchised by the United States government on account of their crimes. To- 
day H. J. Grant patronizes presidents, makes bargains with great political 
parties, dictates the political policies of Utah and at least five surrounding 
states and wields effective political influences in at least five others." 

The gentleman must have been listening to one of the lying 
speeches of a notorious anti-"Mormon" woman. Martin is the Super- 
intendent of the National Reform Association. If he is properly 
quoted he better reform himself, and purge himself of falsehood. 
There is a special place prepared for his kind, and if he does not repent 
he will land there. I announce to all the world that I do not even 
control, politicaly, Utah, and that I have no desire to control Utah, that 
I have never opened my mouth in favor of or against any individual 
in any of the adjacent states that he is reported to say I control po- 
litically. Joseph Smith was told that his name "should be had for 
good and evil among all nations," or that it should be both "good and 
evil spoken of among all people," and we, his successors, have had 
the same privilege. We have been lied about most scandalously. One 
anti-"Mormon" is reported to have said that I had fifteen million 
dollars in a Wall Street bank, as Trustee-in-Trust for the Church; 
and I never had fifteen cents. 

DISBELIEF AND LIES OF THE WORLD CAN NOT STOP THE PROGRESS 
OF THE WORK 

As I have said, all the disbelief of all the world and all the lies 
of men like Doctor Martin, who might inform themselves and there- 
fore do not need to tell these lies, cannot stop the progress of this 
work. Just to show you that it cannot be stopped, let me read again 
what the Lord told Joseph Smith when he was incarcerated in Liberty 
Jail. You cannot keep the revelations of the Lord even from com- 
ing to the Prophet while in a jail. I will let you read some of it 
yourselves. It is Section 121. Read it all. I will start with the 33rd 
verse : 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 9 

"How long can rolling waters remain impure? What power shall stay the 
heavens? As well might man stretch forth his puny arm to stop the Missouri 
river in its decreed course, or to turn it up stream, as to hinder the Almighty 
from pouring down knowledge from heaven upon the heads of the Latter-day 
Saints. 

"Behold, there are many called, but few are chosen. And why are they 
riot chosen? 

"Because their hearts are set so much upon the things of this world, and 
aspire to the honors of men, that they do not learn this one lesson— 

"That the rights of the priesthood are inseparably connected with the 
powers of heaven, and that the powers of heaven cannot be controlled nor 
handled only upon the principles of righteousness." 

Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, John Taylor, or any one of his 
successors, cannot, and never 1 could, handle the powers of heaven only 
in righteousness, and they never tried to. 

"That they may be conferred upon us, it is true; but when we undertake 
to cover our sins, or to gratify our pride, our vain ambition', or to exercise 
control or dominion or compulsion upon the souls of the children of men, 
in any degree of unrighteousness, behold, the heavens withdraw themselves ; 
the Spirit of the Lord is grieved ; and when it is withdrawn, Amen to the 
priesthood or the authority of that man. 

"Behold, ere he is aware, he is left unto himself, to kick against the pricks, 
to persecute the saints, and to fight against God. 

"We have learned by sad experience that it is the nature and disposition 
of almost all men, as soon as they get a little authority, as they suppose, they 
will immediately begin to exercise unrighteous dominion. 

"Hence many are called, but few are chosen. 

"No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the 
priesthood, only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, 
and by love unfeigned; 

"By kindness, and pure knowledge, which shall greatly enlarge the soul 
without hypocrisy, and without guile — 

"Reproving betimes with sharpness, when moved upon by the Holy Ghost; 
and then showing forth afterwards an increase of love toward him whom 
thou hast reproved, lest he esteem thee to be his enemy; 

"That he may know that thy faithfulness is stronger than the cords of 
death. 

"Let thy bowels also be full of charity towards all men, and to the house- 
hold of faith, and let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall thy 
confidence wax strong in the presence of God ; and the doctrine of the priest- 
hood! shall distil upon thy soul as the dews from heaven. 

"The Holy Ghost shall be thy "constant companion, and thy scepter an 
unchanging scepter of righteousness and truth; and thy dominion shall be an 
everlasting dominion, and without compulsory means it shall flow unto thee 
forever and ever." 

Liberty Jail did not keep back the inspiration of the living God 
from Joseph Smith ; as few if any greater revelations have ever been 
given us than this one received in Liberty Jail. 

I will now quote from section 76: 

"And this is the Gospel, the glad tidings, which the voice out of the 
heavens bore record unto us — 



10 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



"That he came into the world, even Jesus, to be crucified for the world, 
and to bear the sins of the world, and to sanctify the world, and to cleanse 
it from all unrighteousness." (Doc. and Cov., Sec. 76.) 

That is the testimony of the gospel that we bear to all the 
world. Men have said: "We believe that Jesus Christ lives, but we 
don't know it." Two men at least knew it, and here is their testi- 
mony ; this is the testimony of Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon : 

"And now, after the many testimonies which have been given of him, this 
is the testimony, last of all, which we give of him : That he lives ! 

"For we saw him, even on the right hand of God; and we heard the voice 
bearing record that he is the Only Begotten of the Father— 

"That by him, and through him, and of him, the worlds are and were 
created, and the inhabitants thereof are begotten sons and daughters unto 
God." 

OUR SACRIFICES FOR THE GOSPEL A PROOF OF OUR LOVE FOR IT 

"Oh but," says one, "I don't believe it." Once more allow me 
to announce that all the disbelief of all the world cannot change the 
fact, if it is a fact, and God has given to thousands and tens of thou- 
sands the witness by the revelations of his Holy Spirit that it is a fact, 
that "Mormonism" socalled by the world, is in very deed the plan of 
life and salvation; that Joseph Smith was in very deed the Prophet 
of the true and living God. People say: "We cannot understand the 
strength of "Mormonism," we cannot understand why two thousand 
young men and young women at one time, at their own expense or 
at the expense of their families, will go into the world, giving their 
time without money and without price, to proclaim the gospel losing 
their wages, paying their own way, to proclaim your faith." Every 
Latter-day Saint can understand it. They understand it because those 
young men and those young women who go' out to proclaim the gos- 
pel, live it, they in very deed are fulfilling the requirements laid down 
by the Savior "to love the Lord our God with all our heart, mind, 
might and strength," and the next great commandment, "to love our 
neighbor as ourselves." No other people in all the world are giving 
such an evidence of the love of God and the love of their fellows as 
is given by our missionaries. Day after day the majority of all the 
letters that come to the desk of the Presidency of the Church are from 
young men and young women who are called upon missions, and it is 
the rarest thing in the world to find a missionary call that is not 
favorably and willingly answered. 

When we send out these calls for missions the answer comes back : 
"I thank the Lord that he has seen fit to inspire his servants to call 
me upon a mission. It has been the dream of my life." Another : "My 
heart has always longed to go forth and proclaim this gospel of Jesus 
Christ. I am grateful that the call has come." That is the class of 
letters that we get day after day. There are tens of thousands of men 
and women who have gone forth to proclaim this gospel, and the 
amount of sacrifice in actual dollars, in proportion to our numbers, 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT

is almost beyond calculation. When you figure that these people 
could earn probably, on an average, $100 per month, that they are 
spending from $20 to, in same cases, $60 and $70 a month, an average 
probably of nearly $50; that two thousand or nearly that number, and 
sometimes it has been in excess, are giving all this time and this ex- 
pense; add it together and it amounts to several million dollars a year, 
and all done with no hope of earthly reward. 

THE UNCERTAIN REPLIES OF THE MINISTERS 

I remember while proclaiming the gospel in England I ran 
across a book written by ex-Senator Beveridge, I believe he was 
then a senator, entitled, The Young Man and the World. I have re- 
ferred to it many times here, but I desire to refer to it again. In that 
book I found chapters on, "The Young Man and the Pulpit," "The 
Young Man and His Home," "The Young Man and the Law ;" and 
in the chapter on "The Young Man and the Pulpit," he said that a 
certain individual with very splendid chances for favorable answers, 
with good opportunities during an entire summer vacation asked of all 
the ministers that he met, three questions and he announced before 
coming to those questions that one of the greatest transportation men 
in all the United States had said that he would rather have a knowl- 
edge that we live again and that the soul is immortal than to have 
the greatest honor and the greatest position that could be given in all 
the world, and he told of another man that was just an ordinary ward 
politician who said he thought of many strange things — "Is the soul 
immortal and what is the soul anyway?" The three questions were 
as follows : 

"First, yes or no, Do you believe in God, the Father; God a per- 
son, God a definite and tangible intelligence — not a congeries of laws 
floating like a fog through the universe ; but God a person, in whose 
image you were made ? Don't argue ; don't explain ; but is your mind 
in a condition where you can answer yes or no?" 

"Not a man answered, "Yes." Each man wanted to explain that 
the Deity might be a definite intelligence or might not ; that the 'latest 
thought' was much confused upon the matter, and so forth and so on." 

Then the next question : 

"Yes or no : Do you believe that Christ was the Son of the living 
God, sent by him to save the world? I am not asking whether you 
believe that he was inspired, in the sense that the great moral teachers 
are inspired — nobody has any difficulty about that. But do you be- 
lieve that Christ was God's very Son, with a divinely appointed and 
definite mission, dying on the cross and raised from the dead. — yes 
or no?" 

"Again not a single answer with an unequivocal, earnest 'Yes.' 
But again explanations were offered and in at least half the instances 
the sum of most of the answers was that Christ was the most perfect 



12 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



man that the world had seen, and humanity's greatest moral teacher." 

He was not a great moral teacher if he was not the Son of God, 
because he announced himself as the Son of God. He announced 
himself as the Redeemer of the world, and therefore he could not be 
a great moral teacher, if the foundation upon which he stood was a 
falsehood. 

The third question was : 

"Do you believe that when you die you will live again as a con- 
scious intelligence, knowing who you are and who other people are?" 

"Again, not one answer was unconditionally affirmative. 'Of 
course they were not sure as a matter of knowledge.' 'Of, course that 
could not be known positively.' " 

THE DEFINITE ANSWER OF THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS TO THESE QUESTIONS 

The Latter-day Saints everywhere in the wide world, without 
one moment's hesitation, would answer : "Yes, yes, yes," to all three 
of those questions. We have no doubt that God is a person. Joseph 
Smith saw him and talked with him. We have no doubt that Jesus 
Christ is the Redeemer of the world because he declared that to Sidney 
Rigdon and to Joseph Smith in the declaration that I have just read 
to you. We have no doubt, because Jesus Christ appeared in the Kirt- 
land temple to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery. We have abso- 
lutely no doubt whatever regarding the immortality of the soul — 

"And should we die before our journey's through, 

Happy day ! all is well ! 
We then are free from toil and sorrow too, 

With the just we shall dwell." 

'I had a letter from the vice-president of a great banking institu- 
tion, to whom I sang this song when he was in Utah, and he asked me 
for a copy of it. A few days later he repeated to me the last verse, 
and said: 

"Those are wonderfully inspiring words. I have never read a 
verse of any hymn that taught such an absolute, firm conviction in 
the immortality of the soul." 

In a letter which he wrote to me he referred to those words again, 
and he said: "I consider these the most sublime words I have ever 
heard. They inspire to courage and that beautiful confidence in the 
immortality of the soul that raises man to the stature of a God." 

Latter-day Saints answer those questions "Yes, yes, yes." Mr. 
Beveridge says that these ministers were among the most eloquent and 
high-grade ministers in the Eastern and New England states, and 
that they felt there was a decline of faith among the people. In that 
connection he said : 

"Is it possible that such priests of interrogation could warm the 
hearts of men?" He went on to say before he asked these quetsions 
that any man who stood up in the pulpit and undertook to teach the 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



13 



doctrines of Christ, when he lacked a faith in those doctrines himself, 
committed a sacrilege every time he entered the pulpit. 

BELIEVE WHAT YOU SAY 

I have heard it said that "damn" is not swearing, that it is only 
emphasis. I was preaching one night with the late President John 
Henry Smith, in the opera house in Phoenix. The legislature was in 
session. Hearing that two of the "Mormon" apostles were there, 
some of the members of the legislature waited on us and said they had 
arranged to hire the opera house, and they would agree to fill it if we 
would condescend to preach. Well, we usually hire our own hall and 
condescend to preach to empty benches ; so, of course, we condescended, 
and were delighted with the opportunity. One of the good sisters 
who came down from Mesa was sitting behind a man while I was 
preaching, and she heard him say, with emphasis, that I was an earnest 
preacher. Pretty soon, with that emphasis again, he said I was a 
good preacher, and finally once more with emphasis he said : "That 
man believes (with emphasis) every word he is saying." I ask no 
greater compliment. 

GRATITUDE TO PARENTS WHO WERE TRUE TO THE FAITH 

Before I sit down I want to say that I have never heard and 
never expect to hear, to the day of my death, my favorite hymn: 
"Come, come, ye Saints, no toil nor labor fear, But with joy wend your 
way," but what I think of the death and the burial of my little baby 
sister, and the wolves digging up her body on the plains ; but what I 
think of the death of my father's first wife, and the bringing of her 
body here for burial, from Echo Canyon; but what 1 think of others 
that I know of, who laid down their lives; but what I think of that 
wonderful journey of Brigham Young and his band of Pioneers, and 
those who followed him, and my heart goes out in gratitude beyond 
all the power with which God has given me to express it, that my 
father and my mother were among those who were true to God, and 
who made those sacrifices for the conviction of their hearts, because 
of the knowledge that they had that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, 
and that Joseph Smith is his Prophet. I never hear this other hymn 
that we have sung here today — "Do what is right" — but what I de- 
sire with all the power of my being to impress upon the Latter-day 
Saints the necessity of following the teachings of the last verse of 
that hymn, 

"Do what is right; be faithful and fearless, 
Onward, press onward, the goal is in sight; 

Eyes that are wet now, ere long will be tearless, 
Blessings await you in doing what's right. 

"Do what is right, let the consequence follow, 

Battle for freedom in spirit and might, 
And with stout hearts look ye forth till tomorrow, 

God will protect you, do what is right." 

God bless you all. Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



A duet entitled, "My Faith Looks Up to Thee," was sung by Louise 
and Catherine Watson. 

ELDER B. H. ROBERTS 

{Of the First Council of Seventy, and President of the 
Eastern States Mission) 

This certainly is a very great surprise to me. I think none of 
the presidents of missions, or any member of the First Council of 
Seventy, ever expect that they will be called upon the first day of the 
conference to take up any portion of the time. It may take a moment 
or two for me to get over my astonishment, and to begin thinking 
about what I may say to you on this occasion. However, very much 
of that great theme upon which our president has been speaking this 
morning deals with matters that are very important and of which I 
have thought much of late. 

I have been very greatly impressed during the last few months, 
while trying to deliver the message of our Church to the world, with 
the importance of the message that we have, not only for individuals, 
but for our nation. Of course our message is primarily to individuals; 
it is a call to repentance for men individually ; a call to repent of their 
sins, and, through the ordinances of the gospel of Jesus Christ, obtain 
remission of their sins, and be born again into fellowship with God. 
Our effort is to bring the lives of men into union with the spirit life 
of God, and thus become spiritually alive; and this message of the 
gospel is unto all those who have not received it. 

But also, it is foreshadowed in that great prophecy, of which so- 
called "Mormonism" is a fulfilment, that this message is to be de- 
livered to every nation and kindred and tongue and people; and I 
believe to nations as such. And especially is this so with reference to 
the Gentile nations of this new world — the two great continents of 
America. And again is this especially so with that great Gentile na- 
tion known as the United States of America, which, because of its 
influence and of its power, dominates the new world, and, in my 
judgment, always will. 

The Lord made certain promises in ancient times concerning the 
land of Zion — North and South America. We are told in the book 
of Ether that when the floods receded from this land, it became a 
choice land unto the Lord, a land which he would dedicate to free- 
dom, and hence, to free institutions, and unto a righteous people. That 
is the information we get from our Book of Mormon. And later on, 
in the history of this book, we get further information as to the de- 
crees of God concerning this land. As follows, for instance : 

"And, he had sworn in his wrath unto the brother of Jared that whoso 
should possess this land of promise, from that time henceforth and for- 
ever, should serve him, the true and only God, or they should be swept 
off when the fulness of his wrath should come upon them." 



ELDER B. H. ROBERTS 



15 



Now, mark you this: 

"And now we can behold the decrees of God concerning this land, 
that it is a land of promise; and whatsoever nation shall possess it shall 
serve God, or they shall be swept off when the fulness of his wrath shall 
come upon them. And the fulness of his wrath cometh upon them when 
they are ripened in iniquity. 

"For behold this is a land which is choice above all other lands; where- 
fore he that doth possess it shall serve God or shall be swept off; for it is 
the everlasting decree of God. And it is not until the fulness of in- 
iquity among the children of the land, that they are swept off. 

"And this cometh unto you, O ye Gentiles, that ye may know 1 the 
decrees of God — that ye may repent, and not continue in your iniquities 
until the fulness come, that ye may not bring down the fulness of the wrath 
of God upon you as the inhabitants of the land have hitherto done. 

"Behold, this is a choice land, and whatsoever nation shall possess it 
shall be free from bondage and from captivity, and from all other nations 
under heaven, if they will but serve the God of the land, who is Jesus 
Christ, who hath been manifested by the things which we have written." 

I think that is rather an important message, national in its scope 
and spirit, and awful in its warning; and I believe that the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is under obligation to lay emphasis 
upon this part of its mission. Knowing the decrees of God concern- 
ing the fate of the nation that shall depart from God, and fill up the 
measure of its iniquity, would it not be a great sin of omission if we 
did not make proclamation of the decrees of God concerning this land? 

In the fore part of the Book of Mormon — in the writings of 
Nephi, there is a message similar in importance. It is in Second Ne- 
phi — the first chapter, as I now remember it; and it there describes 
in effect, the rise of a great Gentile nation that shall be used as an 
instrument in the hands of God in restoring Israel unto their pos- 
sessions in this land. There is no escaping the inference that there 
is held in the mind of the prophet the nation of the United States, and 
that it should become as a nursing father and mother to the remnants 
of Israel in this land, and should be instrumental in bringing to pass, 
in a large way, the will of God with reference to the accomplishment 
of his purposes in the land. In other words, it is quite clear from the 
Book of Mormon, that God has designed to bless the Gentile nations 
upon this land of Zion, if only they will be true to him and to the 
great principles of righteousness that enter into the very attributes 
of God. And, on the other hand, dire calamity is predicted upon the 
proud Gentile nation in this land if it fails God as an instrument in 
the accomplishment of his high purposes. Lehi says : 

"Notwithstanding our afflictions, we have obtained a land ,of prom- 
ise — ■" (referring to America) — "a land which is choice above all other 
lands; a land which the Lord God hath covenanted with me should be a 
land for the inheritance of my seed. * * * Wherefore, I Lehi proph- 
esy according to the workings of the Spirit which is in me, that there 
shall none come into this land save they shall be brought by the hand of 
the Lord. Wherefore, this land is consecrated unto him whom he shall 
bring. And if it so be that they shall serve him according to the com- 



16 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



mandments which he hath given, it shall be: a land of liberty unto them; 
wherefore, they shall never be brought down into captivity; if so, it shall 
be because of iniquity; for if iniquity shall abound cursed shall be the 
land for their sakes, but unto the righteous it shall be blessed forever." 
(II Nephi 1:5, 6, 7). 

Referring to the time when the Lord would begin to gather Israel 
from their long dispersion from the four parts of the earth, the Lord 
says concerning the Gentiles: 

"And the nations of the Gentiles shall be great in the eyes of me, 
saith God, in carrying them forth to the lands of their inheritance. 

"Yea, the kings of the Gentiles shall be nursing fathers unto them, 
and their queens shall become nursing mothers; wherefore, the promises 
of the Lord are great unto the Gentiles, for he hath spoken it, and who 
can dispute? 

"But behold, this land, saith God, shall be a land of thine inheritance, 
and the Gentiles shall be blessed upon the land 

"And this land shall be a land of liberty unto the Gentiles, and there 
shall be no kings upo,n the land, who shall raise up unto the Gentiles. 

"And I will fortify this land against all other nations. 

"And he that fighteth against Zion shall perish, saith God. * * * 
Wherefore, for this cause, that my covenants may be fulfilled which I 
have made unto the children of men, that I will do unto them while theyj 
are in the flesh, I must needs destroy the secret works of darkness, and 
of murders, and of abominations. 

"Wherefore, he that fighteth against Zion, both Jew and Gentile, both 
'bond and free, both male and female, shall perish; for they are they who 
are the whore of all the earth; for they who are not for me are against 
me, saith our God. 

"For I will fulfil my promises which I have made unto the children 
of men, that I will do unto them while they are in the flesh." (II Nephi 
10:9-17.) 

In another part of the Book of Mormon are the very words of 
the Lord Jesus Christ himself, in relation to this subject — in Third 
Nephi, and having in mind more especially the existence of a great 
Gentile nation in this land, which shall be given very 'exalted privileges, 
and upon whom shall be bestowed great power for the accomplishment 
of God's purposes: 

"And blessed are the Gentiles," (said the Savior) "because of their 
belief in me, in and of the Holy Ghost, which witnesses unto them of me 
and of the Father. 

"Behold, because of their belief in me, saith the Father, and because 
of the unbelief of you, O house of Israel, in the latter day, shall the truth 
come unto the Gentiles, that the fulness of these things shall be made 
know,n unto them." 

All of which was done, of course, in the coming forth of the 
dispensation of the fulness of times, in this land of America, and under 
the auspices of guaranteed religious liberty, set forth in the constitu- 
tion of the United States. 

"But wo, saith the Father, unto the unbeliving of the Gentiles — for 
notwithstanding they have come forth upon the face of this land, and 
have scattered my people, who are of the house of Israel; and my people 



ELDER B. H. ROBERTS 



17 



who are of the house of Israel have been cast out from among them, and 
have been trodden under feet by them; 

"And because of the mercies of the Father unto the Gentiles, and 
also the judgments of the Father upon my people who are of the house of 
Israel, verily, verily, I say unto you, that after all this, and I have caused 
my people who are of the house of Israel to be smitten, and to be afflicted, 
and to be slain, and to be cast out from among them, and to become hated 
by them, and to become a hiss and a by-word among them — 

"And thus commandeth the Father that I should say unto you: At 
that day when the Gentiles shall sin against my gospel and shall be lifted 
up in the pride of their hearts above all nations, and above all the people 
of the whole earth, and shall be filled with all manner of lyings, and of 
deceits, and of mischiefs, and all manner of hypocrisy, and murders, and 
priestcrafts, and whoredoms, and of secret abominations; and if they 
shall do all those things, and shall reject the fulness of my gospel, behold, 
saith the Father, I will bring the fulness of my gospel from among them." 

I want to suspend reading the remainder of this passage for a 
moment, while I call your attention to the fact that the conditions 
here named, as to the Gentile nation in this land, are wonderfully ful- 
filled. When this Book of Mormon came forth in 1830, there were 
about twelve millions of people in the United States; now we have 
nearly three times that number in the Eastern States Mission alone; 
and in all the United States, we exceed by considerable, a hundred mil- 
lions within the borders of continental United States. It was a very 
bold prediction to write in a book in 1830, when the United States oc- 
cupied practically only the Atlantic seaboard, and the Ohio valley, to 
some extent — it was a rather bold prediction to write in a book the 
prophesy that this Gentile nation — the United States — would be "ex- 
alted above all other nations, and above all the people of the whole 
earth." But witness its fulfilment today ! It is true, and this nation, 
had in mind when this prediction was sent forth in our modern lan- 
guage, was regarded merely as an experiment in government, and no 
such future was ever dreamed of for it as is here predicted, and now 
fulfilled. And also the other and the sadder part of it; namely— 
that they would not only be lifted up in power above all other nations, 
but also they would be filled with all manner of lyings and deceits, 
and mischiefs and hypocrisies and murders and priestcrafts and whore- 
doms and of secret abominations — "And if they do all these things, 
and shall reject my gospel — " and behold, that is what the people of 
the United States did when they rejected from habitation among them, 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and expatriated the 
membership thereof, so that they were under the necessity of finding 
a refuge in a land, which, at the time our fathers entered it — The 
Salt Lake Valley — was no part of the United States of America — 
but was Mexican territory. 

Listen to this : it is a revelation that we do not often refer to, but 
it has some very choice gems in it. It is the "Word and Will of the 
Lord to President Brigham Young," given at Winter Quarters, and, 
among other things, this was said: 



18 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



"Thy brethren have rejected you and your testimony, even the na- 
tion that has driven you out ; 

"And now cometh the day of their calamity, .even the days of sorrow, 
like a woman that is taken in travail; and their sorrow shall be great unless 
they speedily repent, yea, very speedily. 

"For they killed the prophets, and them that were sent unto them ; 
and they have shed innocent blood, which crieth from the ground against 
them." 

I think our country at that time did not repent of the wrongs 
they had done in this and other things, for this proclamation was im- 
mediately followed by the war with Mexico, in which at least those 
regiments that were selected from western Illinois — one of them at 
least, was well nigh wiped out of existence in the war with Mexico ; 
and it was about the only disastrous engagement that we had in that 
war. Then followed the awful war, between 1861 and 1865, in which, 
as I believe, the hand of God severely punished the United States of 
America, in fulfilment of the wonderful prediction that was made by 
the Prophet Joseph Smith, in relation to the calamities that would 
befall the nation. But they rejected the gospel, and that is foreshad- 
owed in this Book of Mormon passage, and confirmed in the pas- 
sage in the revelation through Brigham Young. And, by the way, in 
confirmation also of what President Grant said about the Prophets Jo- 
seph and Hyrum sealing their testimony with their blood this revela- 
tion has a word on that also. Speaking of the worth of the labors of 
the Prophet, how he laid the foundation of it and was faithful : 

— "And I took him, to myself. 

"Many have marveled because of his death; but it was needful that 
he should seal his testimony with his blood, that he might be honored and 
the wicked might ,be condemned. Have I not delivered you from your 
enemies, only in that I have left a witness of my name?" 

Earth must atone ; the nation in which he lived had to atone for 
the blood of that just man — Joseph Smith — a prophet — and I wit- 
ness to you that our nation did suffer and did atone, as I believe, for 
the great crime against human liberty and the work of God, which, as 
a nation, they rejected when they expatriated the Latter-day Saints. 

And now having paused to note the fulfilment of this prophetic 
part of the Book of Mormon passage, let us note what follows. "I will 
bring the fulness of my gospel from among them," were the last words 
I read in the passage which I suspended reading. And now, contin- 
uing: 

"And then will I remember my covenant which I have made unto my 
people, O house of Israel, and I will bring, my gospel unto them, 

"And I will show unto thee, O house of Israel, that the Gentiles shall 
not have power over you; but I will remember my covenant unto you, O 
house of Israel, and ye shall come unto the knowledge of the fulness of 
my gospel. 

"But if the Gentiles will repent, and return unto me, saith the Father, 
behold they shall be numbered among my people, O house of Israel." 

Notwithstanding the list of their abominations — great as it is — ■ 



ELDER B. H. ROBERTS 



19 



notwithstanding their rejection of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the 
people of God, yet, if they will but repent, God promises to renew their 
lot and their part in the glories of this great Latter-day work. 

Shall we not, then, proclaim to our nation and to all the inhab- 
itants thereof this glorious promise that is held out of the Lord unto 
them ? And the fact that we have eight missions established within the 
boundaries of the United States, and are laboring with all diligence 
to make proclamation of the Gospel — is it not good evidence that God 
is willing that we should continue our labors among the people of 
the United States to bring them to repentance, and to a participation 
in these great purposes and' designs of God, in relation to this land of 
Zion and the work He designs to bring to pass upon it ? 

I continue the passage : 

"But if the Gentiles will repent and return unto me, saith the Father, 
behold they, shall be numbered among my people, O house of Israel. 

"And I will not suffer my people, who are of the house of Israel, to 
go through among them, and tread them down, saith the Father. 

"But if they will not turn unto me and hearken unto my voice — " 

Then he will suffer his people to go through them to destroy 
them, and so following. I should be pleased to read still other words 
of the Lord Jesus Christ to the same effect. I have read from the 
16th chapter of Third Nephi. In the 20th chapter all this is practi- 
cally repeated and much more added, and in these latter passages em- 
phasis is laid upon; the fact that if the Gentiles on the land of Zion 
will repent and return unto the Lord, behold his mercies shall be 
extended to them, and they shall inherit the promises of God and 
have lot and part in the glory and peace and liberty and prosperity that 
God designs to bring forth upon the land of Zion. 

This, then, is what I think constitutes the national phase of our 
mission to the United States — to make proclamation unto the inhab- 
itants of all the land that these are their opportunities and their bless- 
ings if only they will extend their hands- and receive them. And, on 
the other hand, woe be unto them if they hearken not unto the mes- 
sage of God, after all His great mercies unto them. 

I should have been pleased, could time possibly have been had, 
to present to you the full indictment, the indictment that is being 
made against the United States for the lawlessness of its people, the 
increase of crime during the last twenty years especially, and espe- 
cially those crimes of violence that end in murder, in its various de- 
grees. In these higher crimes the United States of America is the 
most criminal nation on earth today. I must be permitted to give at 
least a little evidence to this statement. On August 10, 1922, there 
was published in Current History, for September, a Report of the Spe- 
cial Commission of Law Enforcement, made at a meeting of the Amer- 
ican Bar Association at San Francisco, from which I quote the fol- 
lowing : 

"From all the data and opinions of experts which your committee 
has been able to gather, we beg leave to report that — particularly since 



20 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



1890 — there has been, and continues, a widening, deepening tide of law- 
lessness in this country, sometimes momentarily receding, to swell again 
into greater depth and intensity. At intervals this tide billows into waves 
that rise and break but only for a time attracting public attention. * * * 
The criminal situation in the United States, so far as crimes of violence 
are concerned, is worse than that in any other civilized country. Here 
there is less respect for law. While your committee cannot obtain the 
exact figures, from all available sources of information we estimate that 
there were more than 9,500 unlawful homicides last year in this country; 
that in 1920 there occurred not less than 9,000 such homicides, and that 
in no year during the last ten years did the number fall below 8,500. In 
other words, during the last ten years, no less than 85,000 of our citizens 
have perished by poison, by the pistol or the knife, or by some other un- 
lawful and deadly instrument. Burglaries have increased in this country 
during the past ten years 1,200 per cent. 

"We deem it important to note the material difference between the 
character of crime conditions prevailing here and those abroad. Our re- 
gretab'e eminence is due in most part to crimes of violence against the 
person and property. In 1910, out of the 58,800 confined in our State and 
Federal prisons, 15,316, or more than 25 per cent of all prisoners, had com- 
mitted homicides. While of course this number includes the accumulation 
of years, this awful fact still bears its own significance. The evidence be- 
fore us shows that there has been since 1910 a steady and terrible in- 
crease not only in homicides, but also in burglaries and robberies. One 
State has in its different prisons 3,547 inmates; of these 1,429 are guilty 
of taking the lives of human beings. * * * Crime and lawlessness in 
the United States have been steadily on the increase and out o.' propor- 
tion to our growth, and there has been a steady and growing disrespect for 
law. In our opinion this is not a result of the war. We do not find the 
proportional increase in crime from 1916 to 1922 greater than from 1910 
to 1916, and we have not been able to discover that crimes of violence 
have materially increased in France, England or Canada during or since 
the war, although the effects of the war naturally must be more marked 
in those countries." 

In the face of these conditions, of the truth of which there can 
be no question — is it not necessary to sound this note of warning 
against lawlessness throughout the United States? I am happy in 
the thought that the President of our Church — God's prophet in the 
earth — in his opening remarks this morning put his finger upon the one 
great fact and uttered a warning that ought to be stressed — a warn- 
ing against the lawlessness that obtains throughout our country. It is 
fitting that his voice should sound the key-note of warning, because 
that is what God would have the people of the United States warned 
of — the wickedness that exists among them, and the calamity that 
will follow if they do not repent. 

I bear witness to you, from my heart, that the inspiration of God 
has dictated to our President the Key-note words of warning in this 
conference of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. May 
we sense the responsibility resting upon us as a great missionary 
Church in the earth, charged with the solemn duty of calling men to 
repentance, and warning nations against the fate that awaits the na- 
tion that lapses into lawlessness, crime, and unrighteousness; for God, 
in these things will not be mocked. May we sense our duty and re- 
sponsibility is my prayer in the name of Jesus. Amen. 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE 21 



A number of notices were given out, including the announcement 
that the general Priesthood meeting would be held in the Tabernacle 
on Saturday, at 7 o'clock; and the Sunday School Union meeting 
would be held on Sunday evening at 7 o'clock. 

The choir and congregation sang, "High on the mountain top." 

Elder James Duckworth, President of the Blackfoot stake of 
Zion, pronounced the benediction. 

Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock. 



AFTERNOON SESSION 

At 2 o'clock President Heber J. Grant opened the afternoon meet- 
ing by announcing that the choir and congregation would sing, "We 
thank thee, O God, for a prophet." 

After singing, prayer was offered by Elder Joseph E. Cardon, 
president of the Cache stake of Zion. 

The choir and congregation sang the favorite hymn of the late 
beloved President Anthon H. Lund, "O say, what is Truth ?" 

PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE 

) 

More than ever in my life, I feel this afternoon that I need the 
help of the Lord in endeavoring to address a congregation of his people 
in conference assembled. 

I hope I shall be able to make you hear my words, and that what- 
ever I say may be under the spirit of inspiration from above. I have 
been suffering for sometime from what we popularly call "a cold," 
although I believe I contracted it in the heat. I do sometimes, on rail- 
roads, feeling oppressed with the heat of the car in which I am travel- 
ing, catch what is called a cold; but I trust that with the help of the 
Lord, and your attention and faith, I may be able to overcome the ef- 
fects of this disorder and to speak so that you can hear and understand. 

TRUTH AND THE PRACTICE OF TRUTH' 

I believe every word of the hymn which we have just sung. Truth 
is a great thing, and next to it, perhaps quite on a level with it, is the 
practice of truth. Jesus Christ, according to the New Testament, of- 
fered a prayer to his Father, concerning his disciples, his apostles par- 
ticularly, and he said : "Lord, sanctify them by the truth ; thy word 
is truth." We can always depend upon the word of the Lord, for his 
word is truth, and "truth abideth and hath no end." 

Truth, speaking of it in the abstract, has no beginning. Truth is 
eternal, without beginning of days or end of life. The power and 
ability to receive truth is a great thing — that is a gift which I believe is 



22 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



largely bestowed upon the Latter-day Saints. I believe there is some- 
thing in our racial connection which has to do with this. It is evident 
to me that in the last days the Lord has wrought mightily upon the 
descendants of the house of Israel. We have in the Church, the office 
of patriarch, and those who hold it are supposed to be specially in- 
spired of the Lord to bless the people upon whom they lay their hands, 
and to reveal to them what tribe they belong to ; and the blessings 
that have come to the Latter-day Saints have chiefly been that they 
are of the house of Israel, and the majority of them, at any rate, of 
the tribe of Ephraim, and the Lord has said that they would be first 
in his work in the latter-days. 

A SPECIAL MISSION FOR THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL 

I believe there is a special mission intended for the house of 
Israel in the latter days, gathered in from the various nations, and 
principally it will be of the tribe of Ephraim, and that through them 
the blessing and power of God will go to the world, and particularly 
to the descendants of Abraham, the father of nations and the head of 
his race. 

I had a conversation with a gentleman a short time ago, who is 
connected perhaps rather remotely, with this Church, and he told me 
that he had a blessing from a patriarch many years ago, when he was 
a boy, and he never liked it, for the reason that he was told therein he 
was a descendant of Abraham, and he did not like the idea of descend- 
ing from a Jew. When I informed him that Abraham was not a Jew, 
he seemed to be very much surprised. He said : 'What, Abraham 
not a Jew!" "No," I said, "He was not a Jew. He was dead long 
before any Jews were born." The name of Jew comes from the tribe 
of Judah. Abraham, the father of our race, and, as we believe, our father 
on earth, so far as family is concerned, was "the friend of God," and 
God blessed him and his posterity, because, he said, they would do his 
will and obey him, and they should "keep the way of the Lord." 

Now, I think that we who are of that race, are naturally so dis- 
posed; that there is something with us that tends to our willingness 
to accept the truth when it comes from God. I do not mean to say 
that this is confined to us, but that particularly those who are of 
the house of Ephraim are ready to receive the word and act accord- 
ing to it as the Lord shall direct. 

OUR STANDING WITH REGARD TO CIVIL LAW 

I bear testimony to you that all we heard this morning from, 
our president, for our guidance and direction and enlightenment, is 
true and is very good. The sections from the Doctrine and Covenants, 
and other things that he presented here, are the divine word of truth. 
I have been familiar with them for many years. The section which 
pertains to our intercourse and position in regard to civil affairs — 
the affairs of governments in general, have been familiar to me, 
because from the time that I was a boy, when I embraced the gospel, 



PRESIDENT CHARLES IV. PENROSE 23 



I have believed in them and rejoiced in them — the plain, simple, but 
powerful declaration of our standing with regard to civil matters and 
affairs of Government. We are therein exhorted to be obedient to the 
laws. One of the revelations of God which supports that, states that 
if we obey the laws of God, we have no need to break the laws of 
the land. That has been qualified somewhat by a further revelation 
that all constitutional laws we should observe to uphold, for they are 
from God. We believe that he inspired the writers of the Constitution 
of the United States, that they were led by his Spirit when they com- 
posed that splendid pronouncement of government and law. Of course 
we have had views different from some of our friends in regard to 
what shall be considered constitutional and what should be considered 
unconstitutional, and those are questions that have been raised almost 
from the beginning of our establishment as a nation. But there is a 
provision in the constitution of this country, which gives to the su- 
preme court of the United States authority and power to determine 
what is constitutional. We had some ideas concerning what we con- 
sidered unconstitutional, which had crept into certain laws. We can 
entertain just what view we may think right in regard to them now, 
but we have to obey that which the supreme court of the United States 
decides is constitutional law, so we are told in the revelations of God. 
This we have been endeavoring to do and to conform as far as pos- 
sible to those laws which have been declared to be the constitutional 
laws of the land. 

The Lord has told us in regard to matters in general, and the 
doctrine and principle, and particularly in regard to the laws concern- 
ing marriage — the union of the sexes — that what he has not appointed, 
that which he has not ordained, that which he has not commanded, 
"shall have an end when men are dead, and they shall not continue 
in nor after the resurrection," saith the Lord, our God. He will only 
receive those offerings, he says, which he has appointed; and that is 
a very good guide. 

ORDER IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD 

There is another thing: "My house is a house of order, saith 
the Lord ;" and as we have seen exhibited in the organization of this 
Church, which he, himself has established in the latter days, it is 
really a house of order, for everything in it is in order, according to 
that which we understand to be his divine will, in regard to the laws, 
commandments, doctrines and discipline, and all matters concerning 
his Church and our work therein. 

One of these things, which is very important for us to under- 
stand, and which has been taught from the very beginning of the 
organization of the Church, on the 6th day of April in the year 1830, 
is that the head of the Church — a prophet, a seer, and a revelator — 
shall be appointed by him to receive the oracles, to give the com- 
mandments, the revelations and doctrines in the Church. This I 
consider and always have considered, to be a very wise provision. We 



24 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



are all permitted, under the laws of the United States, under the con- 
stitution of the United States, and under the revelations of God, to 
believe in that which seems right and true to us. Sometimes we do 
not know how to determine what is true and what is false, but we 
can all come to a knowledge of the truth if we are humble and 
tractable and willing to place ourselves in the order that God has es- 
tablished. 

CONCERNING DREAMS, VISIONS AND REVELATIONS 

We hear a good deal in these times about manifestations to in- 
dividuals. These are proper in their place, for those who receive them. 
The gifts of the gospel, which we read about in the New Testament, 
are all restored in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
The gift of tongues, interpretation of tongues, the gift of prophecy, the 
gift of healing, the gift of discerning of spirits, etc., etc., that we read 
about in the epistle of Paul to the Corinthians, are all in this Church. 
I have been blessed with seeing and participating in most, if not all, 
of these gifts that we read about, and they belong to the Latter-day 
Saints just as much as they belonged to the former day Saints; and 
according to the prophet Joel, that after certain wonders have been 
accomplished — the great things of the latter days, the Lord says: "I 
will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh and your old men shall dream 
dreams and your young men shall see visions ; also upon my servants 
and handmaidens will I pour out my Spirit." That is a great bless- 
ing yet to come to the inhabitants of the earth, for the result will be 
as another prophet has declared, that "the earth shall be filled with 
the knowledge of God as the waters cover the great deep." 

Now, all these things will be brought about in due order, accord- 
ing to the mind and will of God, for his Church is established on that 
basis. The man who stands at the head of the Church is the one to 
receive revelations and commandments to the Church, and we are com- 
manded of the Lord to receive "none other." I will not take time 
to read from the book of Doctrine and Covenants in regard to that, 
but I recommend my brethren who have not done so, and some of those 
who have, to get it in their minds anew ; that they read the 43rd sec- 
tion of that book where that principle is plainly set forth under com- 
mandment to this Church, so that while it may be true that the Lord 
will pour out his Spirit upon individuals for their good, for their 
benefit, for their comfort, for their consolation, for their enlighten- 
ment ; while the Lord will do this by dream and by vision and by 
tongues and by the gift of prophecy, etc., that these things he gives 
to his people are for them individually but not for the Church as an 
organization. When he has anything to give to the Church by way of 
revelation or commandment, for the enlightenment of the Church, for 
the government of the Church, to guide and direct them in the right 
path, in the only way — for there is but one — it will come through him 
whom he has appointed — the head of the Church — who presides over 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE 



25 



the Church and has the right arid privilege to receive from the Lord 
inspiration and power like that given unto Moses of old. This is a 
guide for you and for me and for all of us in the Church. 

There are many divine dreams we can read about in the Old Testa- 
ment, some in the New Testament, that are evidently given from the 
Lord, and they are a great blessing so far as they are intended to 
go but no" further, and we must be very careful to distinguish what 
the Lord reveals to individuals, or what they think is revelation 
from the Lord, and what the Lord positively declares he gives to us 
only in the order that he has appointed. "For, my house is a house of 
order, saith the Lord, and not a house of confusion." This Church 
was organized by the gift and power of God. The Book of Mormon 
was revealed by the gift and power of God to' one individual, and 
he was called and appointed for that work and he performed it, and 
there is abundant evidence to prove that it was a divine appointment, 
and that the translation which was made by him by the gift and power 
of God is verily true, and is translated so as to be pleasing to and 
accepted by the Lord. That is a good guide for us, as the Old Testa- 
ment and the New Testament are guides as far as they give us any 
counsel and advice by way of commandment from on high. And the 
blessing that the Lord bestows sometimes upon people, of giving them 
communications by dream at night, or vision by day, are for themselves. 
I can testify that the Lord has done that for me, but I have not made 
known that which was given to me for my own comfort and my ad- 
vice and my benefit. I have had dreams which I have to acknowledge 
were divine, because they were fulfilled to the very letter — clearly 
given and clearly made manifest, and clearly brought into actual be- 
ing — but they were for me and for my guidance and direction, and 
sometimes they were of such a nature that they appeared to me to be 
almost trivial, to think that the Lord would reveal to me certain things 
that were of very small moment. They only affected me and those 
with whom I was associated in the ministry, they came to pass in 
very deed, but I have not had them put on record nor had them pub- 
lished or spread abroad. I did not think that would be right. 

During my experience, when succeeding President Grant as Presi- 
dent over the European mission, I had some manifestations in regard 
to my duties and to guide me in what I had to do when I was what 
we vulgarly call "up a stump.'' I was "up against it," did not know 
what course to pursue but the Lord made manifest to me what to 
do and I did it, and it came out all right in the end. I believe in the 
doctrine of waiting upon the Lord, and I have a special belief in the 
doctrine of Paul, for I have found it to be true all my life, in which 
he says : "We know that all things work together for good to them 
that love the Lord and are called according to his purposes." I know 
that doctrine is true. Events have occurred in my life at times when 
I could not tell which course to take, and in my duties in some re- 
spects; in the mission I have referred to, it was particularly so, and I 
will not take up the time of the congregation to explain any further, 



26 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



only that I know that word of the Apostle is true. We know that all 
things work together for good to them that love the Lord and are 
called according to his purposes, and we can trust in the Lord and obey 
his word, and we can trust in that which he reveals to the man who is 
placed at the head to declare and to bring forth by way of command- 
ment and revelation, and if we will take that little guide that God has 
given us in the section I have referred to — Section 43 — we will not be 
led astray. 

Now, dreams are very peculiar things. I have had some recently. 
They were very clear and plain. I have dreamed several times that I 
had passed out of the body and was in the other world, and I saw 
things and heard things that seemed to me to be just as plain and just 
as clear as if I were actually out of the body, but when I came to wake 
up and weigh what I had seen I found it was only a dream. Just 
what the cause of it was I cannot tell. There are various causes for 
dreaming. The wise man, as he was called, Solomon, said, "In the 
multitude of dreams and words, there be divers vanities," and I have 
dreamed a great deal that was nothing but vanity and followed by a 
vexation of spirit. 

A lady who was a great believer in dreams, came to me once, and 
wanted me to give the interpretation to one of them. She dreamed 
some very peculiar things, "And, Brother Penrose," she said, "just 
give me the interpretation." I did not want to offend her. I saw 
there was nothing in them of any particular moment so I said, "Sister, 
what did you have for supper last night?" You know in England, (it 
was in England) they often have very late suppers. "Well, Brother 
Penrose," she said, "I had some fried pork and onions." "Well," I 
said, "that is the interpretation." I do not want you to infer from 
this that when the Lord gives a dream to anybody, or persons dream 
something which is enlightening* to their souls and comforting to their 
hearts and seems to be clear and plain, I wish to attribute that to any- 
thing else but what they think it is ; but I do say and repeat, that 
nothing is to be received in this Church by way of direction and com- 
mandment, outside of the order which God has established in his 
Church, and which is most wise and beneficent and beneficial. Follow 
the counsel and advice and commandment revealed through the head 
of the Church to the Church and we will not go wrong. 

THE WORK PROSPERS UNDER THE PRESENT ADMINISTRATION 

I enjoyed the meeting this morning very much. I enjoyed those 
readings to which we were treated by the president. I believe in them 
fully and entirely. I am sure they are true and good, and I know 
that the work which is now going forward in the earth is being pros- 
pered under our present administration. I bear witness, not only that 
Joseph Smith was and is indeed a prophet of the living God, but 
that he was raised up purposely in this dispensation to usher in the 
dispensation of the fulness of times, under the direction of Jesus 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE 27 



Christ, the Lord, whom Joseph was told to heed and listen to; and that 
our leaders, down from the prophet Joseph, after his martyrdom, have 
been inspired of God and have been made fit for the work which was 
entrusted to them. It is so today. I have the privilege and blessing 
of being very close to our present president. I have been familiar 
with several who have passed away, had their confidence, I am proud 
and blessed in saying, and their good will. Sometimes they have re- 
ceived my ideas and my word of advice, sometimes they have not, 
but I know they have been men of God, and I do know that everyone 
of them has had his soul set upon doing what God wanted, and to 
benefit the people; that they did not seek their own aggrandizement 
nor their own personal benefit, but they sought the mind and will of 
God, and they were prayerful men ; they were kind-hearted men ; they 
were humble and willing to do that which the Lord required of them 
and which was made known to them. Sometimes things were mani- 
fested to some of them that they did not agree with in spirit until 
they received the manifestation, but when it was made clear to them 
what they ought to do, they have done it and the Lord has been with 
them and he will be with them, as he has been with his servant who 
now stands at the head of our Church, and I rejoice in having his con- 
fidence and good will and that I am able to pray for him as I do 
every day, that he may be filled with the spirit of his office and calling; 
and he has it, and so have his brethren who are associated with him 
as leaders in the Church. 

THE GOSPEL IS TO ALL NATIONS 

This morning's conference was a wonder. A great congregation 
gathered here. I thought to myself, in a kind of humorous vein — 
how clearly this proves the assertion of the world that "Mormonism" 
is going down, particularly that the third generation of "Mormons" 
will discontinue their faith ! And while I was thinking of that, Brother 
Ivins, who was sitting next to me, had the same idea, no doubt, be- 
cause he made the same remark. Well, it is wonderful ! Is it not 
wonderful how we were gathered here this morning to demonstrate 
the untruth of what is said concerning the going down of "Mormon- 
ism." "Mormonism" is spreading and prevailing. "Mormonism," 
so-called, is fulfiling its mission in the world. It was established by 
the Father and the Son, and angels have come from them to the 
servants of God on the earth, and brought great truths for the benefit 
and salvation of the children of men, and we are called and appointed 
to carry this message to all the world. This is not only to individ- 
uals, but, as somewhat touched upon by Brother Roberts this morn- 
ing, it is to "every nation and tongue and people;" it is as Jesus 
Christ told his apostles, to every creature — "Go ye into all the world," 
said he, "and preach the gospel to every creature. He that believeth 
and is baptized shall be saved, and he that believeth not shall be 
damned; and these signs shall follow them that believe — " You can 



28 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



read what they are, in the New Testament. I believe in every word 
of that; and now, in these the last days, the Lord has repeated it to 
us. He says that we are his messengers. What he revealed to Orson 
Hyde and some other elders, as we read in the book of Doctrine and 
Covenants, Section 42, is to all of us, to all his servants who are 
sent to the world; they are to go forth and preach this to everybody. 
I have tried to do my part in the good work. Brother Grant has had 
a wide field of labor ever since the time when he was ordained one 
of the twelve apostles. He has labored in all the nations he has spoken 
about. 

READY TO WEAR OUT IN THE SERVICE OF GOD 

I hold in my pocket here today, my Elder's certificate, I was 
called to go forth and preach the gospel without purse or scrip, to 
carry the message wherever I could, and I was ordained, according 
to my certificate, on the 6th day of January, 1851. I continued dil- 
igently in that work until I was released to come here, a little over 
ten years afterwards, and then I have been back there three times 
since then, and it is all right. I have nothing to complain about ; 
I rejoice in these things, and I am still endeavoring to do my part 
in the work. Many of you old Saints here will remember Brother 
George B. Wallace, who was one of the presidency of the Salt Lake 
stake of Zion many years ago. He was on a mission in England 
with Daniel Spencer, and they were counselors to the president of .the 
European Mission. He came to me, when I was called very un- 
expectedly when quite a young fellow, to the office in Jewin Street, 
London, and I was ordained an elder on that occasion, and told what 
my mission was, and he looked at me as if he would look me through, 
and said: "Brother Penrose, it is expected of the elders of Israel in 
these last days, that they will wear themselves out in the service of 
God, and it is better to wear out than to rust out." Now, that ad- 
monition given to me then has been with me all the time in my work 
in the Church. I am ready to wear myself out in the service of God, 
to try to carry out the admonition that we are to be willing to do all 
things, sacrifice all things, even to the laying down of our lives, if 
necessary, for this great work, and it is worth it, it is worth all that 
and a great deal more. It is worth all our being, is this work that we 
are engaged in. 

THE WORK IN THIS GREAT CAUSE SHOULD BE DONE CHEERFULLY 

The idea that men have to be stirred up by teachers or other 
officers to do their little duties in the Church, and particularly in the 
Priesthood, is a wonder to me — why a man should have to be urged 
to stand forward and minister in the things of God, to make himself 
well informed as to all that is to be done, and to do his part is a mystery. 
He ought to be glad in heart, cheerful in spirit, and disposed always 
to do his little bit, or great bit, if it is a great bit to him. Everything 
that we have is from the Lord. All items of information, every 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE 29 



testimony of the Holy Spirit, which we have enjoyed so many times 
during all these years, are from God, not from men, it is to me, and I 
am thankful for every manifestation of light and intelligence and 
understanding in the things of God that has come to me, and I have 
had that disposition and have it today, to do anything and everything 
that lies in my power. 

TESTIMONY 

I regret to say that my eyesight is failing very fast. There is no 
disease in my eyes, no pain in them, thank God; I have been freed 
from the pains that I endured for a while in my body; my physical 
organization, through the blessing and gift of God, through his inspir- 
ing power, in answer to prayers. I am thankful today for this, but 
I have worn out my eyesight, so to speak,, in working for this Church 
and people, and for myself therein. Everything I have been able to 
do for the Church has also been done for me; it has blessed me and 
comforted me and opened to me the things of eternity, in which I 
rejoice with all my heart and soul, and am glad to be able to bear 
testimony, once more in the midst of the congregation, that I know 
this is God's work ; I know he commenced it ; I know he is carrying 
it on now ; I know it will prevail ; I know it will conquer every evil ; 
truth will overcome error, under the inspiration of God, under the 
labors of his servants ; light will dissipate the darkness ; misrule will 
pass away, and the government of God will be established upon the 
earth, and Christ will be our king just as sure as we are gathered 
here in this tabernacle this afternoon. And we are the children of 
God. We are of the right family and race. God has called us, every- 
one, male and female, men, women and children who are born in the 
covenant; they are all especially sacred to the Lord and his work. 
Under the divine direction, through the^ order that he has established 
in his Church, we should be ready and 'willing to take our place and 
labor with all our might and do everything we can to promote this 
great work. 

CONSECRATION AND LIBERTY OF THE SAINTS 

Now, in regard to the liberties of the Latter-day Saints, I can 
say this that in all my associations with the leaders of the Church, 
past and present, I have never been coerced or compelled, or com- 
manded to do things that were contrary to my own feelings and good 
will ; what I have done, I have done voluntarily in the exercise of that 
God-given gift, the gift of agency, which God says he gave to man. 
Yes, we are indebted to God for that. When we were first born in 
the spirit world our agency was given to us — when we were begotten 
or organized or created, whatever you are pleased to call it — it all 
means the same thing — we were begotten unto the Lord, as the presi- 
dent read this morning from the great Vision. 

Well, we should be consecrated to him and ready to labor for 
him, for when we are laboring for him, we are laboring for ourselves, 



30 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



with all the truth we can gather to our souls, all the intelligence that 
can be communicatee^ to us, which we receive and put in action under 
divine direction. Though we may die and our bodies be buried in 
the ground we shall rise again and we shall receive these gifts, or 
have them with us, in the morning of the first resurrection, and we 
shall go on to that glory and power and dominion and extent which 
is incomprehensible, which is everlasting, which is without end. These 
things are for us, for you and for me, if we will put ourselves in the 
right way to receive the divine law and to act upon the divine com- 
munication, and put ourselves in the order which God has established, 
and be guided thereby. 

My brethren and sisters, I feel well this afternoon, in spirit, rather 
weak in body, but I am very glad — more than I can tell— that I have 
the privilege of saying a few words to you in this conference. I have 
attended a great many. I have always rejoiced in them. I rejoice 
today. What there is of me left on the earth is at the service of the 
Lord and his work, as it has been from the beginning. I rejoice in 
it ; I glory in it ; I thank God for all his gifts and blessings to me, 
and what little good I have been able to accomplish. It does me good 
to hear the missionaries come back and give the testimony that they 
do, that President Grant spoke about this morning, and to note the 
willingness of those who are now being called to go into the mission- 
field, and the desire they have had in their bosoms for years. They 
have grown up from childhood with a disposition and a desire to 
sacrifice themselves, so to speak, to go out to the world and preach 
the gospel without pay, without earthly reward. It is a great blessing 
and it is a great sign that God is working with the youth of Israel. 
They are of the right kind of people; he has chosen them and sent 
down their spirits to be born on the earth in these latter days, especially 
to engage in this great work, and to exercise their agency. 

FREE AGENCY AND OUR GLORIOUS DESTINY 

Everything that God reveals is upon the principle that we can 
receive it, or reject it if we want to. We ought not to want to reject 
anything that comes from the Lord, through his properly appointed 
channels. We should be glad to know the word and be glad to carry 
it out. Now, if we have this disposition, these gifts that are spoken 
about — spiritual gifts — they are all from one spirit, though that spirit 
has different operations and different phases, so to speak; different 
degrees, like light has — natural light — so that the light that comes 
from God, that divine light, is the Holy Spirit, it is the Spirit by 
which the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost, as a personality, act. 
That is their spirit ; it is the spirit of creation. God created all things 
firstly spiritual, and afterwards temporal, but he did it all, so he says, 
by the power of his Spirit, and his Spirit pervades all things, not only 
on this earth, but throughout the vast immensity of space. God will 
guide and direct this work, as he commenced it, for certain purposes — 
and, I was going to say — bring it to- an end, but there is no end to it ; 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE 31 



there will be an end to our earthly work in the body; there will not 
be an end to our continuation in after life, if we come forth with a 
crown in the kingdom of the Father and inherit all things, all heights, 
all depths, all breadths, all eternity, all knowledge, all intelligence, all 
wisdom, all power, and our family increase will go on and there will 
be no end to it, and therefore, no end to our glory. 

Glory be to God, I feel in my heart today, for all his goodness to 
me, and for that which he has revealed and will reveal for the salvation 
and redemption of the human race, and give us power to use the agency 
with which he has endowed us, for good, for the benefit of mankind, 
the building up of the kingdom of God, and the preparation of the 
way for the coming of the King of kings and Lord of lords. 

May God's peace be with you and with us all, and may we be 
able to attain to the great salvation, even the crown in the kingdom 
of the Father, through Jesus Christ. Amen.

ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN 

(Of the First Council of Seventy and President of the 
California Mission) 

It is certainly a great privilege, my brethren and sisters, to be in 
attendance at this general Conference, and to have the opportunity of 
occupying a few moments in this meeting. I most earnestly hope that 
the words I speak may be prompted by the same good Spirit that has 
directed the remarks made by the brethren who have addressed the 
people thus far in the conference. I realize, my brethren and sisters, 
that one can only teach the things of the kingdom of heaven by the 
inspiration of the Spirit of the Lord, and that ievery man must be 
under the direction and in the companionship of that Spirit, if he is 
to magnify his calling and Priesthood and discharge acceptably the 
duty and responsibility that rest upon him as a servant of God, who 
holds divine authority. 

I am very glad to say to the people that the California mission, 
is in a very prosperous condition. We are glad to be able to report 
that the missionaries assigned to that field of labor are striving as a 
general thing to discharge the duties that rest upon them. They are 
making earnest effort to come in contact with the people throughout 
the mission, and to deliver to them the message of the gospel, and 
make exposition according to their power and ability concerning the 
truths that have been revealed, and that they have been authorized to 
teach. The missionaries know that these principles are essential to the 
salvation of the children of men. Generally speaking, the missionaries 
are young men and women with but little experience in the Church. 
Many of them come into the mission field without any experience at 
all in standing before the people, to attempt to give expression to their 



32 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



thoughts pertaining to the gospel, but they all come with the deter- 
mination to discharge their duty. They all manifest a very willing and 
obedient spirit. As a general thing, they are anxious to study the 
gospel and to obtain information by the reading of the Holy Scriptures, 
and by asking questions that will help equip them for the duties that 
rest upon them as preachers of righteousness. It is certainly a very 
wonderful thing to observe the spirit and attention to duty manifest 
by these young men and women, and to note the development they 
make and the understanding they come to concerning the work of 
God until, notwithstanding the feeling of weakness of which they 
are all possessed to a greater or less extent, they do come to feel and 
know in their very souls that they have been called of God to preach 
the gospel of his Son, and they do have an assurance that they have 
been blessed with that authority which is necessary in the preaching 
of the gospel. I oftentimes feel, as I listen to their testimonies, and 
note the development that they make, that they are just as sure in 
their own souls concerning the truth of the work of God, as their 
fathers and mothers are. There is no indication on the part of the 
missionaries who are laboring in the California mission that they 
love the truth of God one whit less than the generation that preceded 
them. They are just as anxious and they are just as determined to dis- 
charge the duties that pertain to their calling as their fathers or their 
grandfathers could have been in the days that have gone by. 

We have about ten thousand Latter-day Saints in the California 
mission. Most of these people are located in the state of California; 
a few, probably seventeen hundred, are in the state of Arizona, and a 
much smaller number in the state of Nevada. The mission includes 
portions of the state of Arizona and portions of the state of Nevada. 
There has been a very wonderful growth in the membership of the 
mission during the past two years, not so much by way of conversions 
although there are always some honest souls found by the mission- 
aries, as they go from door to door, or as they lift up their voices in 
the proclamation of the gospel upon the street corners, who hearken 
to their message, and are brought to investigate the principles of the 
gospel, and become convinced of its truth, and cheerfully enter into 
covenant with the Lord our God by going down into the waters of 
baptism. A few hundred souls, year by year, are thus convinced of 
the message that the missionaries are seeking to impart to the people ; 
but the great development in numbers has come from people at home. 
We have had, probably, in the last eighteen months, or such a period, 
two thousand or more Church members who have come to California, 
bringing their recommends, and have undertaken to establish homes 
in various portions of the state. Many other Church members have 
come into the state who have not yet become identified with the 
Church. 

California has not been distressed financially to the same extent 
during the past year or two that many of the western states have been. 
There has been considerable employment; in fact, I think there has 



ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN 



33 



been employment for all who desired to find labor, particularly those 
who are engaged in building, as there are thousands of residences and 
many great hotels, theatre buildings, bank buildings, and other build- 
ings of like character, that have been erected during the past year or 
two. The present year is one of the remarkable years in the growth 
of southern California. It has been stated by those who seem to 
understand and know what they are talking about, that there are 
more buildings now being erected, or that have been erected during 
the present year, than in any other like period in the history of Cal- 
ifornia, and because of the lack of employment and dull business con- 
ditions in Utah, Idaho and Arizona, and other sections, many of our 
people have come to California to find employment. I am happy to 
be able to say that, as a general thing, they have found employment, 
and have been able to maintain themselves comfortably. These new- 
comers are strengthening, to a very wonderful degree, the branches of 
the California mission. I suppose the largest branch that has ever 
been known in the Church is located in Los Angeles. This branch has 
a membership of about three thousand souls. The Los Angeles branch 
is divided into a number of subdivisions. There are no independent 
branches in these suborganizations, but there are five other divisions 
where Sabbath schools are being held, where a preaching service is 
conducted every Sabbath morning, and where Relief Societies have been 
organized. There are also other districts that are being opened up 
where we hope in the near future there will be other organizations 
effected. 

We have been trying to give attention to the people who have 
come in from the adjoining states. We are seeking to effect organ- 
izations and endeavoring to impress upon the people, as they come, 
that they are always under obligation to give service to the work of 
God, and to be true to the covenants that they have made with our 
Father in heaven, and set an honorable upright example before the 
people. 

We try to impress upon the missionaries that it is the solemn 
obligation of every man and woman who has been called to be a 
preacher of righteousness to be an eloquent preacher in conduct. It 
may not be given to every man or woman to expound the doctrines 
of the gospel by word of mouth eloquently, but we feel that it is given 
to every man and to every woman to expound the gospel, most elo- 
quently, by the uprightness of their lives, by living in such a manner 
that those who look upon them may feel in their hearts to say: This 
man or this woman is a good man or a good woman. Their conduct 
indicates that they have the fear of God in their souls, and that they 
desire to work righteousness. 

Wa are trying to impress upon the minds of men the principles 
that have been spoken of in this conference. We are testifying to the 
people that we are living in a wonderful age in the history of the 
world, and that in this great and last dispensation in which we live, 
the Lord our God has in very deed revealed himself to mortal men; 



34 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



that by the sending of holy angels the divine authority, which had 
been lost from among men for ages, has been restored, and that there 
is necessity for this authority ; that men cannot be saved ifl the pres- 
ence of God without the authority of the holy Priesthood. The or- 
dinances of the gospel necessary to the salvation of men can only be 
legally administered by divine authority, and no man can assume that 
authority. If men pretend within themselves — even though they may 
have honest feelings in their own souls — that they have the authority 
to preach the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ and to administer in 
the ordinances thereof, they but deceive themselves ; for the administer- 
ing of gospel ordinances can only be properly and legally attended to 
by the authority of the holy Priesthood. 

We are trying to impress upon the minds of men the fact that 
that authority has been restored ; that God our Father in heaven has, 
in very deed, in this age of the world, given back to man the same 
power and authority that was exercised by the apostles of old, and 
by other men who were chosen, legally and properly by the apostles, 
and sent forth to preach the gospel of repentance. 

We do not feel that it is possible for any being to receive this 
authority from the Holy Scriptures. Recently, in one of our priest- 
hood meetings, a young lady missionary, who feels the great responsi- 
bility that rests upon her, and her own weakness, and is seeking to 
discharge her duty in going from door to door, came to the home of 
a minister of the gospel, and the minister gave the young lady to 
understand that it was time wasted for her to come to his door with 
the message that she had to deliver. Pie told her that he had been a , 
preacher of the gospel for forty years, and wanted to know from her 
what right she had to come to his home with the gospel message. 
She then wanted to know from him where he obtained his authority. 
She asked a very simple question: "How did you obtain authority 
to be a minister of the gospel, and to administer gospel ordinances?" 
And he made answer : "I obtained that authority from the Holy 
Bible." Well, my brethren and sisters, weak as the lady missionary 
may have felt, she did know in her soul that he had never obtained 
one particle of authority to administer in the name of Jesus Christ 
from the Holy Bible. She had understanding and comprehension to 
know that no man living can find authority to speak in the name of 
the Redeemer of the world by the reading of the Holy Scriptures, 
that authority can only be received by the laying on of hands and by 
the voice of revelation and prophecy. 

When inquiry is made of missionaries of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints, as to how they obtained authority they 
give an altogether different answer. I have given it myself when 
men have wanted to know: "How did you receive authority?" 1 
have made answer: "I was ordained to be a special witness of the 
Lord Jesus Christ, a Seventy in the Church of Christ, by a man named 
Royal A. Barney, and Royal A. Barney was ordained to the same 
calling by the Prophet Joseph Smith. Joseph Smith was ordained 



ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN 



35 



by Peter, James and John, who were ordained by the Lord Jesus 
Christ;" and I have no thought or fear in my mind when I make 
this sort of answer, that any man living can overturn the foundation 
of authority that has been given to me, by the laying on of the hands 
of a humble servant of God who had been properly authorized and 
commissioned by authority thus revealed from heaven in these latter 
times. It cannot be overturned. 

I rejoice in my soul in bearing witness that this divine authority 
has been given. I rejoice in the opportunity of inviting men to in- 
vestigate the message of the gospel, and I understand that I am called 
to preach the fundamental principles of the gospel, thjat the re- 
sponsibility is upon me, and upon my associates, to cry repentance 
among the people, to invite men not only to have faith in the Re- 
deemer of the world, but to repent from sin, and we understand that 
if men repent, they turn away definitely and entirely from wrong- 
doing. As it has been said by one of the apostles : "Let him that 
stole, steal no more;" and this teaching applies to every other line of 
misconduct. We persuade men to repent and to receive the or- 
dinance that has been given by our Father in heaven, whereby re- 
mission of sins can be obtained, through the holy ordinance of bap- 
tism by immersion. How it gladdens my soul ; and it gladdens the souls 
of my companions, when they go down into the waters of baptism 
and, lifting up their hands before the Lord God of heaven, and before 
their associates and witnesses, can say: "Being commissioned of 
Jesus Christ, I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, 
and of the Holy Ghost." For it is by that sort of commission, and 
by that character of authority that we lead men and women into 
the waters of baptism, and we do know that this authority has been 
given us. 

I sometimes feel that men think that it is a radical and improper 
attitude for young men and women, who stand up with more or less 
fear in their hearts, and make the declaration that they know that 
the truth of God has been revealed, and that divine authority has 
been restored. I, however, rejoice when I hear them bear such a rec- 
ord, for I know concerning this matter; and as God is my witness, 
I knew that God has spoken in the days of my boyhood. It came to 
me when I was far off, laboring as a boy missionary — the conviction 
and the knowledge that Jesus Christ is the Son of the living God, 
the Redeemer of the world, and that he has revealed in this dispensa- 
tion the principles and doctrines and ordinances that I have been called 
to teach. That knowledge came into my soul most convincingly forty- 
one or forty-two years ago, although it seems to me, when I look back 
that long, before that, before I ever felt that I could honestly and 
truthfully bear witness to such knowledge, when I look back now, 
it seems to me that there was always within me an abiding assurance 
that the religion of my fathers was in very deed the religion of the 
Lord Jesus Christ. I do know, as my associates know, whether they 
be young or old, that we have not assumed this authority, that w« 



36 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



have not sent ourselves, but that we have been called of God by the 
Redeemer of the world, through the authority of the holy Priesthood 
to be preachers of righteousness ; and we do have the right to call men 
to repentance and to warn them of the judgments and calamities that 
are coming upon the inhabitants of the earth. The Lord God of 
heaven will confirm the testimony that is delivered by his servants 
and handmaidens, whether they be young or old, and the inhabitants 
of the earth in due time must be brought to comprehend and know 
that we speak the truth and lie not, thank God. 

And this is my joy and knowledge and testimony that these prec- 
ious things that have been spoken by the presiding authority of the 
Church during these meetings are the truths of God, that they have 
been revealed, that they are to remain, that they are in very deed 
the power of God unto salvation. I feel again and again in my 
ministry to consecrate and reconsecrate my time and service to the 
spread of this glad message among the inhabitants of the earth. I 
feel that I am under obligation to the Lord God of heaven who has 
given me, from the very jaws of death, my life, and with the help 
of God I shall bear witness concerning his truth, whether men receive 
me gladly or whether they receive me with contempt. I am under ob- 
ligation to bear this record and witness that God hath indeed spoken, 
that his Priesthood and authority have indeed been restored, that Joseph 
Smith was the great instrument to reintroduce the gospel of the Lord 
Jesus Christ, which is the power of God unto salvation, and I pray 
that with you I may be true, firm and steadfast to this testimony 
forever and ever, through Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER CHARLES W. NIBLEY 

{Presiding Bishop of the Church) 

While I stand before you this afternoon and attempt to address 
you, I earnestly desire that the spirit which has characterized our 
meetings and the utterances of our speakers may continue with me, and 
that I may have that which I need so much, the Spirit of the Lord, so 
that the words spoken will be of benefit and service to the work of 
the Lord. 

I rejoice in the testimonies of the brethren such as have just been 
delivered by Elder McMurrin, for I know him to be a faithful servant 
of the Lord, one who is desirous of doing and performing the mission 
to which he has been called, in an earnest and acceptable manner. And 
let me say, the Church is blessed with an abundance of young men, 
as well as middle-aged and elderly men, who are just as faithful, just 
as earnest, just as devoted, just as certain of their position with re- 
spect to the work of the Lord as Elder McMurrin is. We know well 
enough that the Lord has established this work, and is bringing to 
pass his purposes in connection with it. This is his special work, and 
to this Church is given the power and authority to lead the world to 



ELDER CHARLES W. NIBLEY 



37 



spiritual life, so that our mission really is to teach the people how 
they may come from death unto life. For a man may be very much 
alive in a temporal way, and yet be spiritually dead. 

There are great problems also before our nation, which demand 
solution ; they are burning, pressing questions which must be solved, and 
which can only be solved on the principles of righteousness. These 
principles will help to adjust the jarring, warring, contentious prob- 
lems which selfishness very largely produces, and which can only be 
solved through the principles that the Lord has revealed. It is not 
in man that walks, to guide his steps aright. It is not in man of 
his own power to solve these problems, nor can any man do it of 
himself alone. It is only by the help of the Spirit of the Almighty 
that will bring us to the point where justice and righteousness can 
at least approximately be approached. We have had contentions in 
our own nation during the recent months of railroad strikes, coal 
strikes, and other contentions that have threatened the very existence 
of our government; and also there have grown up in our nation, 
secret organizations, combinations of men, no doubt desiring to pro- 
tect their own selfish interests, even though those interests should 
conflict with the strict principles of justice. Some of these organiza- 
tions like the Ku Klux Klan have undertaken to administer what they 
call justice, independent of Constitutional law, and the rights of men, 
and they have taken the law into their own hands and have dealt with 
certain people in a way which can only result in disorder, turmoil, 
strife, and in the breaking down of Constitutional law. For these 
secret organizations undertake to administer punishment upon men 
and women, irrespective of the laws of the land. 

It has been the counsel of the leaders of this Church from the 
beginning, to observe the Constitutional law of the land, and it is stated 
in the revelations that whatsoever is more than this or less than this, 
cometh of evil. We do not need anything outside of this strict letter 
of the law, for if we do go beyond it, or come tardy of it, we are 
liable to make a mistake. The agency that the Lord has given to his 
sons and daughters was given to all — the free agency to choose be- 
tween right and wrong, and that agency makes us free, for the Lord 
has said, "If ye abide in my truth, then are ye free indeed." Now, 
whenever any man enters any organization, secret or otherwise, that 
takes from him a certain degree of that free agency to choose between 
right and wrong, and makes of him a servant, to do as he is told in 
certain matters, quite irrespective of the righteousness or justice of 
the case, or of the right or wrong of the case, then that man sur- 
renders that much of his free agency which he ought not under any 
circumstances to surrender. Let me explain. 

In the Bishop's Office the question was brought directly before 
us as to the right of a man to labor on some work which the Church 
was doing, whether he belonged to a Union or not. We decided that 
we would hire Union men or non-Union men; if they were good work- 
men, we would not ask the question as to whether they belonged to any 



38 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Union or not. But we were confronted with this difficulty: one of our 
brethren who is a Union man, refused to work on the job with a 
non-Union man, a good member of the Church. In this case we said, 
this brother who does not belong to your Union is a good man, a 
good neighbor, a good citizen; you meet with him at the Sacrament 
table and administer the Sacrament to the Latter-day Saints. You 
may be appointed as a block teacher and go around teaching the 
Saints their duties. You may both be called on to administer to the 
sick, and you go and offer your prayers, but when it comes to work- 
ing together, you, our brother who has a Union card and belongs to 
the Union, will not allow this good brother of yours to work for his 
living, nor will you work with him in any way, because he does not 
belong to your organization. Now we ask, do you think this is right 
or just or fair? He, a good man, every way 1 acceptable, a good work- 
man, to be deprived of working on a job because he refuses to sur- 
render any part of his God-given agency to any organization whatso- 
ever on the face of the earth? Or, because in this he refuses to put 
himself in a position where he may be called upon to do a wrong; 
for it is a wrong to say your own brother shall not have the priv- 
ilege of earning a livelihood because he will not join your organiza- 
tion. On the other hand, a man comes along who is not the best kind 
of a citizen, who may be more or less disreputable, who is rather a 
discredit to good citizenship than otherwise, and yet he can show a 
Union card, and you, my good Latter-day Saint brother, who belongs 
to the Union, you will work with him; you will allow him to work 
for his living and join with you in this work, although he is not one- 
twentieth part the tithe of such a man as your own brother in the 
Church is, whom you refuse to work with. 

This Union brother acknowledged that such was practically the 
case, and yet he was powerless to help it. Now, my brethren and 
sisters, don't you see that this man had surrendered so much of his 
free agency to this Union of his that he was not permitted to do that 
which was plainly and clearly right toward his own brother in the 
Church? Therefore, I say, the counsel which has been given all along 
by the leaders of the Church, to refrain from joining any organiza- 
tion, or giving your allegiance, or any part of your allegiance to any 
society or Union which will interfere in the least degree with your free 
agency, is good sound counsel. Of course, one will say that he has 
a right to join whatever organization he pleases. It is true that he 
has that right, but his duty, his plain simple duty, is to protect his 
brother and the interests of his neighbor. A good many people stand 
upon their rights, as they say, and quite often forget their duties. 
Our duties to our God ; to our Church ; to our families ; to our neigh- 
bors; these ought to be first, rather than prating so much about our 
rights. 

Our President said this morning in his opening remarks, we be- 
lieve in freedom, in liberty; liberty for a man to work without being 
threatened to be killed if he does work. Now, I grant you that some 



ELDER CHARLES W. NIBLEY 



39 



of these organizations have done much to bring a greater share of 
prosperity to the laborers than they otherwise might have had, but 
would you say that a man working for you as a farmer, and you are 
right in the midst of your fall work, getting up your potato crop, per- 
haps you have a car that must be loaded; it is urgent that this work 
be done, because there is a storm coming, and your potatoes will be 
frozen, and what not, — and right then, knowing your extremity, this 
man who knows the circumstances you are in, and how much you 
need his help, he yet says, I am going on a strike; it is my right to 
strike, and I quit work right here. Would you say that this man was 
doing the right thing, doing his duty when he leaves the farmer in 
that predicament, just because he knows he can inflict an injury upon a 
man whom he is working for? That spirit is wrong, and most repre- 
hensible. 

The President of the United States, in one of his messages, said 
that there is just as much sacredness in the right to work as there is 
in the right to strike. Well, I thought in analyzing that statement, 
What sacredness is there in the right to strike, if by striking I injure 
my brother? Am I not commanded as a Latter-day Saint, and di- 
rected always by the revelations of the Lord, to love my neighbor? 

Now, the impression I would like to leave with you is this, that 
the counsel which has been given all along by the leaders of the 
Church is good, safe, wise counsel, and that is, to join no organization 
which interferes with your doing the right thing under any and all 
circusmtances. Of course, we must be charitable. We must be for- 
giving. The Lord has given us some very high ideals in respect to 
this matter, in these latter-day revelations through the Prophet Joseph 
Smith. 

You can read in the 98th section of the Doctrine and Covenants a 
revelation which was given just after the first mobbings and drivings 
in the state of Missouri, how the Lord instructed the Saints that, al- 
though they had been mobbed and plundered and driven and robbed 
of their property, yet the Lord puts the high ideal before them in that 
revelation, that they must forgive even their enemies, and even though 
that enemy has not repented. If he has repented, thou shalt forgive 
him seventy times seven ; but "If thine enemy" — mark you, thine 
enemy — "if thine enemy comes upon thee and repents not, neverthe- 
less thou shalt forgive him." This is the wonderful standard of for- 
giveness which the Lord holds up to this Church. It is of the same 
spirit that we read of as being exhibited on Calvary, when the Lord 
of all said, "Father forgive them, for they know not what they do." 
I say again, we should remember our duties as well as remembering al- 
ways what we call our rights ; the duty of the husband to his wife, to 
love and to honor and protect, and a good many of us husbands have 
learned to obey as well. 

We do not need to join any organization in the world outside of 
the CEurch of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to be absolutely free, 
and this Church has given evidence, let me say in plainness, of its de- 



40 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



termination to keep and abide the laws of the land, and to observe 
them, and to uphold them. This Church did that in the principle of 
plural marriage, which it surrendered in obedience to law, even though 
the Church did not believe the law to be Constitutional. But when 
it was declared Constitutional the Church surrendered, and has obeyed 
the law. Could any stronger evidence be given that this Church stands 
for obedience to the law? 

We should uphold all the laws of the land whether we like them 
or not; so long as they are the laws of the land, we should observe to 
uphold them. The prohibition law; the cigarette law, whatever law 
is enacted ; and while it stands on the statute book, it should be obeyed. 
If we will remember the first great commandment, "Thou shalt love 
the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and might, mind and strength," 
that will always keep us within the law, obeying the law, respecting 
the law in whatever land or country the Saints may abide. And if we 
will think more of our duties, and a little less, perhaps, of our rights, 
we will be gainers thereby, and we will not break any law of the land, 
for the Lord has said, "He who observeth the law of God hath no 
need to break the law of the land." 

My brethren and sisters, I hope that we will go home from this 
conference determined as a great body of people, to stand for law, 
order, righteousness, justice and peace on earth and good will among 
all men. I believe as the Prophet Joseph has written, that the day 
would come when there would be so much of disorder, of secret com- 
binations taking the law into their own hands, tramping upon Consti- 
tutional rights and the liberties of the people, that the Constitution 
would hang as by a thread. Yes, but it will still hang, and there will 
be enough of good people, many who may not belong to our Church 
at all, people who have respect for law and for order, and for Con- 
stitutional rights, who will rally around with us and save the Consti- 
tution. I have never read that that thread would be cut. It will 
hang; the Constitution will abide and this civilization, that the Lord 
has caused to be built up, will stand fortified through the power of 
God, by putting from our hearts all that is evil, or that is wrong in the 
sight of God, by our living as we should live, acceptable to him. 

I bear witness to you, my brethren and sisters, that this is indeed 
the work of the Lord. I am not only sure of it; I am certain of it. 
I am certain as to our position in respect to this being the special 
work of our Father who is in heaven. I am absolutely certain that 
it is the power of God unto salvation to all nations, kindreds, tongues 
and peoples; to everyone that will hearken. These men, the presi- 
dency of this Church, and the other leaders of the Church with them, 
have received that authority which enables them to give guidance and 
direction in that way, that the great sweep of the Kingdom of God 
will go on and on, conquering, and to conquer until every knee shall 
bow and every tongue confess that Jesus is the Christ to the glory of 
God the Father. 

May the Lord hasten it in his time, and prepare us for the great

days that are coming, that we may go forth and preach the gospel of 
Jesus Christ in all the world, build up his Kingdom, and give our 
first allegiance, and no divided allegiance, but our first and sole al- 
legiance, to God and country, through Jesus Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

As you all know, we have more preachers than time; and all the 
time has expired, really, but we will ask Brother John M. Knight, 
the President of the Western States mission, to talk and to forget 
the time until at least ten minutes after 4 o'clock. 

ELDER JOHN M. KNIGHT 

(President of the Ensign stake of Zion, and President of the 
W estern States Mission) 

My brethren and sisters, I rejoice in the privilege I have of 
attending this session of our conference. I desire that the few mo- 
ments that I shall sepak to you I may be blessed of our Father, and 
have the same good spirit that has characterized the remarks of our 
brethren. I rejoice that our President has given unto us a definite 
and positive and concrete statement with respect to the attitude of the 
Church concerning some of the great problems that confront us. So 
far as I am concerned, I shall go to the people of the Western States 
mission and advise the Latter-day Saints who reside there to observe 
the counsel, the advice and the instructions they have received this day. 

I call to mind the semi-annual conference of the Church nineteen 
years ago this month. At that conference President Joseph W. 
McMurrin was one of the speakers. His remarks on that occasion 
have had a great influence upon my life. I was prepared to leave 
Salt Lake City to make my home in southern Idaho. I had made 
preparations to sever my connections with my father in a business 
way, and to leave this city for that section of the country. Brother 
McMurrin advised the Latter-day Saints living in this city, at that 
particular time, if they entertained any such ideas that they should 
seek counsel before leaving. I went to Brother McMurrin the next day 
at his home. I asked him for counsel and he said : "I cannot give it 
to you. I will take your case to the presiding brethren." He did so, 
and late in the afternoon of that day came and told me what they 
had to say. I was advised to remain in Salt Lake City. That was not 
the counsel I wanted. I desired with all my heart to go, and my 
father turned to me and said: "My boy, what do you intend to do?" 
And I said : "Follow the counsel of my brethren. 1 never would 
have sought counsel if I did not intend to obey it." 

Sometimes we seek counsel and we fail to obey that counsel. 
Sometimes counsel is given unto the Latter-day Saints without their 
seeking, and they fail to obey it. I call to mind that at the conference, 



42 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



six months ago, certain counsel and advice were given to the Latter- 
day Saints. I know that they have not followed that counsel, some of 
them to their sorrow. I want to say to you that I have implicit faith 
and confidence in the presiding authorities of the Church, and with 
the help of my Father I promise to follow the counsel and the ad- 
vice and the instruction that they give. I thank God that I had the 
strength to follow their counsel ; for, for four years after that counsel 
was given I went through the most trying period of my life. Sick- 
ness and death in my family, financial reverses and other things 
came, one following the other with great rapidity, and ofttimes I 
wondered if my own judgment would not have been best. But I am 
grateful unto the Lord that I have had the disposition to be obedient 
to the counsel of our brethren, and I know there is safety in follow- 
ing their advice on all matters. Time has demonstrated beyond the 
possibility of a doubt that the counsel given me was the very best thing 
for me. 

I rejoice in the blessings of the gospel. It is a wonderful priv- 
ilege to come up to Zion to partake of the influence of a gathering of 
this kind, for, as Bishop Nibley has indicated, there is strife and bitter- 
ness and contention in every part of the world, and it is a privilege 
to gather with the Saints of God who have in their hearts a love for 
him and a desire, I am sure, to serve him and to keep his command- 
ments. I feel that, as a people, the time has come when we should turn 
our faces towards the rising sun, and that we should set our hearts 
like flint against the very appearance of evil, that we should give the 
very best efforts of our lives to the furtherance of God's work here 
upon the earth. I wish we were as loyal to the presiding authority 
of the Church as some of our enemies say that we are. The article 
referred to by President Grant this morning by Dr. Martin was pub- 
lished widely in the newspapers of the United States. It appeared in 
tha Denver Post with heavy headlines. I wished that he did have the 
power that was indicated, while I knew that he was not exercising 
such power. 

One of our reverend gentlemen from this state visited the West- 
ern States mission and he magnified greatly the statements that were 
given by Dr. Martin, He not only said that President Grant con- 
trolled millions, but billions of dollars — I think four billions of dol- 
lars that he controlled in actual money. I presume he would like to 
get his hands upon it. This good gentleman applauded our efforts as 
misionaries. He told of our wonderful organizations. He spoke a 
good word for the Sabbath schools of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints. He referred to the loyalty of the Saints in ob- 
serving the law of tithing, and after saying a number of good things 
he asked the question : "What can we do to stop it ?" ( Laughter. ) 

Well, I remembered the word' of the Lord, and I felt in my heart 
to say that neither he nor any of his kind, nor even the devil him- 
self, could stop the work of the Lord, so long as we were in the line 
of our duty, and preaching the gospel of repentance to the nations

of the earth. I am thankful to my heavenly Father for the faith that 
I have in the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, for the influence it has 
had upon my life. I am grateful unto my Father in heaven for my 
parentage, for my ancestors. I represent the fourth generation in 
the Church. My grandfathers and great grandfathers and grand- 
mothers, and my father and mother passed through all the trials in- 
cident to the pioneering of this great western wilderness, and they 
were faithful to the truth. I ask for no greater legacy than that, be- 
cause their lives were an inspiration to me, and they encouraged me 
in living the principles of the gospel. I mentioned this fact in Den- 
ver, that I represented the fourth generation in the Church, and our 
baby, a little fellow of seven years, went to his mother and said : 
"What do you think father called us in meeting?" And she said: "I 
don't know, son, what was it?" He said: "Father said that we were 
the fifth amendment" (Laughter). 

I am also thankful that my children are faithful to the truth, 
and that they are willing to bear the same testimony that their great- 
great-grandparents bore concerning the restoration of the gospel. 1 
know as I know that I live that it is the power of God unto salva- 
tion to every one that believes and obeys the commandments of our 
Father. I rejoice in the opportunity of bearing this testimony to the 
people of the earth. We are not ashamed of it. 

"We're not ashamed to own our Lord, 

And worship him on earth ; 
We love to learn his holy word, 

And know what souls are worth." 

We have no controversy with the world, but, as I say, we make 
a definite and a positive statement with reference to the fundamentals 
of our faith. We know that if people will obey them in their lives 
that they will receive the witness of the spirit that it is the power of 
God unto salvation. We are not afraid to make that statement . We 
lay down the gauntlet to the world and declare upon their obedience 
to the fundamentals of the gospel they shall know whether it is of 
God or whether we speak of ourselves. I thank the Lord for all of 
these blessings. I pray that his Spirit may attend us that we may 
have a desire always to serve him and to keep his commandments and 
that we may be loyal to the presiding authorities of the Church, and 
that when they give us counsel and advice and instruction we will 
reduce it to practice in our daily lives. 

May God help us so to do I pray in Jesus' name. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang, "Redeemer of Israel, our only 
delight." 

Benediction was pronounced by Elder Mark Austin, president of 
the Fremont stake of Zion. 

Conference was adjourned until 10 o'clock Saturday morning. 



SECOND DAY 

The meeting opened at 10 a. m., Saturday, October 7, 1922; 
President Heber J. Grant presiding. 

The congregation sang the hymn, "How firm a foundation, ye 
Saints of the Lord." 

The opening prayer was offered by Elder William L. Rich, Presi- 
dent of the Bear Lake stake of Zion. 

The choir and congregation sang, "O ye mountains high." 

ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 

This very remarkable conference, with its great attendance, and 
its pointed instructions has made me think seriously about many im- 
portant matters. I have been stirred into thought, especially concern- 
ing the chief message given us yesterday by President Grant. I have 
been trying to determine the causes or forces in our civilization that 
make men obedient to law, or that make us unwilling to obey the laws 
of God, or of the land. 

EDUCATION AS A FACTOR IN OBEDIENCE TO LAW 

I have been thinking most, I believe, about the part that edu- 
cation plays in training our citizens to obey and to sustain the law 
and to be loyal in all respects. There is a tremendous power in edu- 
cation. As we are taught and trained in schools, and by those whom 
we follow, so we become. The late war gave us several examples of 
the power of long continued education to fasten ideals upon a whole 
nation. 

We are an education loving people. I was really amazed to note, 
from statistics gathered by the Presiding Bishop's office, as one of 
the fruits of this marvelous work known as "Mormonism," that of 
all the Latter-day Saints between 8 and 18 years of age, only twenty- 
two have not attended school. I doubt whether such a record can be 
duplicated by any other people, of the same number, in all the world. 
Our schools and colleges are crowded to overflowing. I am informed 
that the Agricultural College of Utah and the University are 
the two largest institutions of the kind in the United States, when 
the population is considered. It is proper for this people to 
be seekers after enlightenment — to be education loving — for the 
revelations of God declare that we are to "seek out of the best books 
words of wisdom ; seek learning, even by study, and also by faith." 
It is also declared that "The glory of God is . intelligence." I have 
been wondering to what extent this love for education and this use 
of education may be made to sustain the teachings given us by the 
prophet of God in his address to us yesterday. The great problem 
before us seems to be how to direct the tremendous power that resides 
in our educational desire and activity so that our children may become 



ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 



45 



rounded, well informed men and women, not educated in one direction 
only, but rather so educated that all their powers are developed and 
strengthened. 

THE SPIRITUAL NATURE A BIG INFLUENCE IN EDUCATION 

We imagine too often that we can place most of our burdens, 
with respect to our children, upon the schools ; yet, this is not possible, 
for our public schools are not permitted to teach all that should be 
taught mankind. As all know, in our free land, there is a provision 
in the constitution of the United States — perhaps the finest in the con- 
stitution — which provides for religious freedom; and in consonance 
with that constitutional provision, religious instruction is not permitted 
in our public schools. Since man is not merely physiological, or in- 
tellectual, but also spiritual, our schools do not wholly suffice for the 
full training of man. Yet it is quite as natural for a man to desire 
religious education as to desire education for his body and mind. This 
truth is borne out by human experience to such a degree that I have 
no need to dwell long on it here; but it came to my at- 
tention again with renewed force just a few weeks ago. I 
had the privilege of visiting, in company with two mem- 
bers of our Church, and several who were not members, the great Rain- 
bow bridge, or Rainbow Arch, located in southeastern Utah, not far 
from the Arizona line. It is one of the most beautiful of all known 
works of nature — a gigantic, perfectly formed bridge or arch of bril- 
liant red sandstones spanning the canyon symmetrically from side to 
side. Through the efforts of President R. D. Young of Sevier stake, 
there was found, in a squirrel's hole, the registration book which had 
been used since 1909 by the occasional visitors to this bridge. In this 
book the visitors had written their names and comments that had 
occurred to them. Some very distinguished names were found in this 
book. Theodore Roosevelt and three of his sons had been there, I 
think in 1913, and had written their names in the book. The names of 
other men and women of national prominence were inscribed in the 
book. One man of national renown had written below his name : "Here 
hath the Master wrought with consummate skill." This man, not 
primarily a religious man, a well known scientist, standing before this 
marvelous creation of God, this great, wonderful natural bridge, felt 
himself drawn to God, and left a testimony of faith to all who might 
follow. Another man, under his signature, wrote, "This is a wonderful 
work of God. Remain here and worship God in all His glory." He 
also turned from the physical beauty of the bridge to the great spirit- 
ual beauty of the Maker of the bridge. This is the natural and normal 
instinct of all men. We are spiritual, as well as mental and physical; 
and our education, to be complete, and fully satisfactory, must take 
into account the demands of the spiritual nature of man, and provide 
for religious instruction. The man whose mind and body alone are 
trained is not necessarily a safe citizen, because such education is 
no guarantee against a criminal life or a life of lawlessness. 



46 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Education frequently helps the criminal in his lawless deeds. 
Spiritual education is the best known means of causing men to use 
their powers for human good. We are not justified in sending our 
children to schools and colleges to be developed mentally, with just 
the barest opportunity for spiritual development during the most criti- 
cal period of their lives. 

THE HOME MUST NOT SHIFT ITS RESPONSIBILITIES TO THE SCHOOL 

Since religious training is not permitted in the public schools, be- 
cause it is against the law of the land, the question is how are we to 
supplement the work done in our public schools, so that our boys and 
girls may be spiritually developed, and thereby become better able to 
do the things that have been called to our attention in this conference ? 
I am dwelling on this for a few moments — realizing that there is no 
time, since there are many speakers, to develop this subject — merely 
to call the attention of the Latter-day Saints to the necessity of not 
placing the whole burden of education upon the schools of the land. 
Too often, of course, school trustees and school teachers are afraid of 
doing what they really might do, under the constitution of the United 
States. This is not a God- forsaken country; this is essentially a God- 
fearing country, and there is no reason why, in our public schools, we 
should not teach the love and the fear of God. Since, however, we 
may not do this as fully as we would like, we must go for help to the 
home and to the church — the two remaining agencies for the rounding 
out of education. 

Those who have read the history of recent human thought, will 
remember that during the last forty or fifty years, the fathers and 
mothers of our land, having witnessed the wonderful development of 
the educational system within this country, have gradually placed in- 
creasingly much of their responsibility upon the school. The home 
has been minimized in importance ; the school has been made larger in 
importance than was ever intended by the clear thinkers within the 
field of education. The home still retains its duty — the duty of teach- 
ing and training and developing young men and women spiritually, 
filling in where the school under the constitution is unable to do its full 
duty. The home must not, and can not, in safety, shift its responsibil- 
ities to the school. 

CHURCH SCHOOLS OF TREMENDOUS IMPORTANCE IN SPIRITUAL TRAINING 

The Church should likewise be of tremendous importance in 
spiritual training. In this Church we have auxiliaries of various kinds, 
the chief purpose of which, as I view it, is to spiritually train our 
school-trained generation. I would like to leave the thought with the 
Latter-day Saints on this occasion, that the prime purpose of the 
auxiliary institutions of this Church is to supplement our educational 
efforts, as made through the public schools. The Church has also 
provided a system of Church schools — in possibilities, the ideal school 
of course — in which the child the youth and the maiden may receive 



ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 



47 



instruction, not only out of books of learning made by man, but also 
out of books of God ; where man may be trained physically, mentally 
and spiritually for complete living, and be better fitted thereby to 
obey the law and to do all other necessary things in living up to the 
teachings that are taught in this and similar pulpits throughout this 
Church, and throughout other churches. A number of splendid high 
schools, junior colleges and normal colleges are maintained by the 
Church, to the great advantage of thousands of students. 

SEMINARIES AND RELIGION CLASSES WONDERFUL HELPS IN 
RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION 

But, it is impossible for the Church to maintain church schools that 
will reach all the people, nor would it be wise or proper to maintain 
an educational system, competitive with the public school system, and 
therefore, we have in this Church a wonderful organization, scarcely 
understood by the people, known as the Religion Class, which is a 
definite attempt under the law to correlate religious instruction with 
the work which the law permits to be done within the elementary pub- 
lic schools. I take the liberty to call your attention to the religion 
classes, from this point of view, in the hope that all Latter-day Saints 
may give special attention to the meaning and purpose of this great 
movement in the Church. Then, continuing the religion class, the 
Church provides for the same purpose — the development of the spirit- 
ual man, so that, educationally, he may be rounded out fully, the Sem- 
inaries which are maintained for the religious training of high school 
students, and in close proximity of the high school, but not in connection 
with it. In these institutions the young men and women who attend 
high school, may receive an hour a day, if possible, proper 
religious instruction. The Religion Classes and the Seminaries pro- 
vide means by which the training of the boy and girl may proceed 
symmetrically, step by step — not in mental chunks one year and re- 
ligious chunks another — but so that each year throughout the whole 
course of education, we may teach and train all the faculties of man. 

A great university of sound and modern scholarship, the Brig- 
ham Young University, stands at the head of the Church school sys- 
tem, and serves students of university grade. It is not able to care 
for all the students who desire to enter it. The state of Utah main- 
tains a magnificent state university and an equally magnificent state 
agricultural college, the students of which no doubt will have access, 
in time, to devices, under the law, that will enable them to secure train- 
ing toward God as well as toward material things. 

This important subject has rested on my mind since yes- 
terday morning, when I heard our President deliver his ringing mes- 
sage in behalf of obedience to law ; and, as my analysis has proceeded, 
I have come more and more to the conclusion, that through the public 
school system, and through our religious auxiliaries, we may be able 
to help accomplish the thing for which President Grant pleaded yester- 
day.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



SPIRITUAL AND MENTAL EDUCATION MAKES DEPENDABLE INTELLIGENCE 

In conclusion let me say again, that to be merely mentally trained 
is to be only partly trained. The man whose mind only has been 
trained may be likened to the ship with great engines and a huge pro- 
peller, ready to drive the ship forward, but without rudder, chart, com- 
pass, or definite destination. When we add to the man, so trained, 
spiritual training, then it is as if we add to the ship, with its wonderful 
machinery, a compass, a chart, a rudder, and a dependable intelligence 
which controls the whole machinery, above and below deck, so that 
the vessel may reach a safe haven, according to a definite purpose. 

A TESTIMONY 

May God bless us in our educational endeavors and in all our 
endeavors. May he strengthen us to make us able to fulfil our great 
destiny, to be the great people of the world in virtue and righteous- 
ness. I bear you my testimony that I know that the work represented 
by this Church is the truth ; that God lives ; that his Son came on earth 
in obedience to a great plan, to suffer and to die for us ; that Joseph 
Smith was a prophet of God, who came here to do God's will, in con- 
tinuation of this mighty and eternal purpose, and that the Church is 
still directed by God. It is good to be a Latter-day Saint. I thank 
God for the privilege that has come to me to be a member of this 
Church, to share in the privileges of the Priesthood, and in the blessings 
that flow from it. God be praised that he brought this truth to me 
and to my family and to you and to yours. God be with us always, I 
ask it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER HYRUM G. SMITH 

{Presiding Patriarch of the Church) 

I am very much impressed with the spirit of this conference. We 
are a record-making people. I have been in parties that have climbed 
to the top of some of our highest mountains, and I have found there 
hidden away in monuments or some kind of hidden place, records of 
those who have made the climb. 

I believe we make our own records, whether it be in our schools, 
in our homes, in our places of business, or in our fields, or where- 
ever our lot may be cast. 

A NAME IN THE SAND 

Alone I walked the Ocean strand, 
A pearly shell was in my hand; 
I stooped and wrote upon the sand 

My name, the year, the day : 
As onward from the spot I passed, 
One lingering look behind I cast, 
A wave came rolling high and fast 

And washed my lines away. 



ELDER HYRUM G. SMITH 



49 



And so, me-thought, 'twill quickly be 
With every mark on earth from me : 
A wave of dark oblivion's sea 

Will sweep across the place 
Where I have trod the sandy shore 
Of time, and been, to be no more, — 
Of me, my day, the name I bore, 

To leave no track nor trace. 

And yet, with Him who counts the sands, 
And holds the waters in his hands, 
I know a lasting record stands 

Inscribed against my name, 
Of all this mortal part has wrought, 
Of all this thinking soul has thought, 
All, from these fleeting moments caught, 

For glory or for shame. 

George Denison Prentice. 

There was a time in the. history of this people when it was dif- 
ficult for us to obtain books in which to keep the records of our 
work and our doings, but today we have almost astonishing equip- 
ment; that is, it is astonishing to our minds because of its nature. It 
is so convenient, so adequate to our needs. I remember when I was 
about sixteen or seventeen years of age, my father moved his family 
from the ward, and when we went to get our transfer we 
discovered that the record was not complete. The ward clerk had 
failed to record the dates of baptism of the children. Well, what 
was to be done? We knew that we had been baptized, we knew that 
we were members of the Church, because we had kept our own rec- 
ords. My father had kept a record of his family and the bishop and 
his clerk were provided with the record of the baptism of my father's 
children, and so when we moved away from the ward we left it with 
a complete record of our standing and membership in the Church. 
Well, now I am wondering how many before my day found it difficult 
to keep a record of the fact that certain ordinance work was per- 
formed in the Church, and I suppose that in the early history of this 
people a great many records were neglected for the want of suitable 
and prepared material. But today scarcely anything is neglected for 
the want of suitable material and equipment. I thank the Lord for 
the many wonderful things that have been provided by way of lighten- 
ing the burdens of those who keep records. In my experience I can 
appreciate these material blessings which we enjoy today. I can see 
my grandfather in the many, many years that he was Presiding Pa- 
triarch of the Church, waiting patiently while someone wrote by hand, 
in longhand, hundreds and hundreds of his blessings pronounced upon 
the heads of the Latter-day Saints. Today nearly all of this record 
making work that is done in the Presiding Patriarch's office, is done 
by machinery ; a great blessing in the saving of time and energy to 
all parties concerned. And in my opinion the process of record keep- 
ing in the Church was never more satisfactorily done than at the 
present time. So I speak personally with gratitude in my heart for 



50 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



the blessings of the Lord in providing means of equipment to lighten 
our burdens, that we may do the work required of us in a pleasing 
and acceptable way, and not avoid any of it or let it pass unaccom- 
plished. 

I am grateful unto the Lord for the comfortable homes that we 
as Latter-day Saints possess today. I thank the Lord that he has 
blessed us with homes and fields and flocks and herds, with the in- 
dustries that are suitable and needful, as well as some of the best 
schools in all the world, with some of the best teachers in all the 
world. I thank the Lord that we have at our disposal such adequate 
means of transportat'ion, that such a body of people as was seen here 
yesterday morning could come even in the middle of the week if nec- 
essary to meet in general conference at the call of the President of the 
Church. People from almost all quarters of the world met here at 
an appointed date and time. 

I thank the Lord for this good weather which makes it possible 
for us to enjoy this conference, the occasion is a time in my life of 
rejoicing and thanksgiving. I take the liberty, my brethren and sis- 
ters, as an officer in the Church, to acknowledge the hand of God in 
his blessings to us and to this people; not only in the few things which 
I have mentioned, but in the many,, many things, even in the detail of 
our work, in the different responsibilities that come to us who are 
called to carry on the Lord's work. I acknowledge his hand in the 
many blessings which he has placed at our very doors. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, let me urge that we, both old and 
young, begin to appreciate our blessings, begin to take notice of the 
fact that the Lord is blessing us, for I declare to you that the Lord 
has prepared many great and important blessings, and every one of 
them, as the Prophet Joseph Smith has declared, is predicated upon 
obedience to law. There isn't the slightest kind of a blessing, neither 
small nor great of any kind, that you or I may receive or do receive 
except we obey tlie law upon which that blessing is predicated. Now, 
what a grand and a- glorious thing it is when we know the laws upon 
which our blessings are predicated. They have been taught to us in 
our own language, revealed from heaven for our own benefit, for the 
salvation of both the living and the dead. What a glorious thing to 
know. Let us take advantage of the fact that these blessings and the 
laws upon which they are predicated are revealed to us, a people who 
have been gathered into this quarter from every civilized nation under 
heaven, to bring about the purposes of God in these the last days, to 
fulfil those wonderful prophecies that were made upon the head of 
that wonderful progenitor of ours, Joseph, who was sold by his breth- 
ren ; and as was related yesterday, the great majority of us discover 
through our blessings that . we are descendants of his chosen son 
Ephraim, to whom the greatest responsibility was given at the time 
of his blessing. Brethren and sisters, let us appreciate our privileges 
and the day and time in which we live, for the Lord has said where 



ELDER HYRUM G. SMITH

much is given much is required. None of us, I suppose, are above 
making mistakes, but when we discover that we have made mistakes 
it is a very simple thing on our part to correct them. When we do 
wrong we know we do wrong, every one of us. What a noble thing 
it is in us, when we discover that we have done wrong, to do our duty, 
and correct that wrong. The Lord through his ancient and modern 
servants has declared that he that is a committer of sin is a servant 
of sin. When we discover that we have done wrong we know that we 
have grieved the Lord. 

Therefore, my brethren and sisters, let me urge you to repent 
of wrong-doing when you discover that it has been done, that we may 
obey the laws which have been given to us, the laws of the everlasting 
gospel, the laws of life and salvation. Let us prepare ourselves, 
through the light of truth that has been given us, that the wonderful 
blessings which were promised hundreds and hundreds of years ago 
would be given, may be given to us who live in the very time that the 
prophet declared they should be, for these truly are the last days, 
when the Lord has set his hand for the last time to accomplish his 
work upon the earth, and may we be true and faithful and be able to 
carry the burdens placed upon us, and with all the advantages and the 
blessings of equipment of every name and nature that are placed at our 
disposal, may we not be worldly, but may we remember our blessings 
and our privileges, and the promises that are made unto us. May we 
receive those blessings ; and may we be spared from the calamities and 
judgments which may come into our midst or surround us. May we 
observe to live pure and simple lives, — true Latter-day Saints, and enjoy 
the blessings of the home and the field and the office, the blessings 
of God which are surrounding- us. May his blessings continue to be 
with us and with this people, that we may enjoy his preserving and 
protecting care, that we may not fall heir through our weaknesses to 
disturbances and calamities which are prepared for the world. I know, 
brethren and sisters, that we are very prone through our pride, some- 
times, and perhaps through our false education, or perhaps through 
some other cause, to be very prompt in following the fashions of the 
world ; but let me raise my voice in warning against this practice 
among us as a people, that we be not followers of the fashions of 
the world, lest we be followers of those for whom the judgments and 
the calamities have been prepared. If we follow the fashions of the 
world, then we place barriers in our own pathway, and prevent our 
Father from bestowing upon us those marvelous blessings which he 
has prepared for the faithful. Let me urge you, my brethren and 
sisters, to remember that we are not of the world, therefore we need 
not follow the follies and the fashions of the world, but let us be old- 
fashioned enough to be Saints of God, pure and modest in our con- 
duct, in our dress, and in our social affairs. 

May God bless us that we may have the courage of our convic- 
tions, whether we be young or old, to live true to the faith, receive 
these marvelous blessings, and stand prepared to carry forward the 



52 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



work of God, to be his chosen people and accomplish his work, whether 
we be reared here in the valleys of the mountains or whether we come 
from foreign countries. Let us be faithful and the Lord will re- 
member us, for he is a just God and his mercies and favors will be 
upon us as individuals and as a people if we will only observe to fol- 
low the laws and commandments which have been given us, upon which 
our blessings are predicated. God bless you all, those whom he has 
called to hold positions of leadership and responsibility, from the 
President of the Church to the least and last one called. 

I rejoice in having the privilege of being a member of this great 
conference, in the presence of leading spirits, both men and women. 
I rejoice in the privilege that I have of going about in the stakes and 
wards of Zion mingling my soul and spirit with these choice men and 
women of the Church. God bless you all in your different responsi- 
bilities that the Lord's work may be accomplished to his honor and 
glory, both in this life and in the life to come, through Jesus Christ. 
Amen.

ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 

My soul is overflowing with deep gratitude this day that in the 
providences and mercies of the Lord I have been permitted to live 
upon the earth in this generation, and that I have been so blessed of 
him, through the obedience of my grandparents, on both sides, to 
the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, to be associated and identified 
with the Latter-day Saints. I know of no time in all the splendid 
past when, if I had been given the privilege of coming to the earth, 
I would rather have come than now. I am therefore grateful for life, 
for being, for knowledge and testimony that I have concerning the 
work with which I am identified. 

ANXIOUS FOR RAPID GROWTH AND STEADY PROGRESS 

When I see the future of this people, through the revelations 
which the Lord has given and through individual inspiration he gives 
to us, and grasp and comprehend the greatness of this work, I con- 
fess that I sometimes almost become impatient in my keen anxiety and 
desire to see the work go forward more rapidly. I recognize that 
large bodies move slowly, and while we as a people are not large in 
comparison with the world, nevertheless we are becoming a body of 
considerable size, and naturally the progress will be rather slow, but 
I am so anxious that it shall be a steady progress towards the great 
and glorious goal God has destined for this people. 

OUR MISSION TO INDIVIDUALS AND TO NATIONS 

I recognize the truth of what was said yesterday relative to our 
mission being to the world, to men and women in the world inclivid- 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 



53 



ually, and also that we have a mission to declare the glad news that 
the only plan and the only way by which even nations may survive 
is by and through the plan that the Lord Jesus Christ has devised, and 
has regiven again to the earth in this dispensation. Recognizing all 
that, I still realize, as you do, I am sure, that there is a tremendous 
responsibility resting upon us as individuals to contribute individually 
to the accomplishment of God's great purpose, in establishing this peo- 
ple, calling them out from the world for a distinct and specific pur- 
pose, and I am anxious that nothing, so far as the outside is concerned, 
or that may arise from the inside of this Church, shall in any sense 
retard the progress of the work. 

THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS A PECULIAR PEOPLE 

We are not fanatics, as some have thought we are, and some 
still say that we are a freak people, and believe in freak things. Let 
them say what they will. If it is freakish to serve God and keep his 
commandments, if it is freakish for us to observe the Word of Wis- 
dom and abstain from the use of tobacco and tea and coffee, then let 
us be a freakish people. I would like to be that kind. The Lord has 
said that this people would be a peculiar people quite unlike anybody 
else; but while we are in the world we are not to be of the world. 
We are to be different, we expect to be different, we rather pride our- 
selves on the' fact that we are different, and I hope the day will never 
come but that we shall be different from the world generally speak- 
ing, but that difference must not be a difference only of view; it must 
be a difference of life; it must be a difference of standards; it must 
be a difference in quality and not only in profession. I rejoice when 
I see the fruits of the work. When I see the progress, slow as it seems 
to be at times, nevertheless there is progress. I rejoice in it. I am 
convinced, however, my brethren and sisters, that that progress, so 
far as the work is concerned, might go forward more rapidly if only 
we were willing. The Lord is willing, and great and important things 
that he has in store for Zion, await us on condition of our preparation 
for their coming forth. If only we had been willing we might have 
been far beyond where we are ; but the Lord is very patient, and I am 
sure his servants who have led this people have been patient with 
them, although at times undoubtedly they have been sorely tried to see 
an apparent spirit of indifference towards vital things to which the 
attention of the people has been called. But nevertheless the Lord has 
been patient, and the leaders of the people have been patient and will 
continue to be, and the Lord is going to take care of this people ulti- 
mately, because he has promised it ; he made that promise to Daniel of 
old, that this work should never be thrown down nor should it be 
left to another people. By and through this people shall these glorious 
things be accomplished, though many shall fall by the wayside on the 
right hand and on the left hand. This work shall go forward, this 
work is not builded upon a single theory, nor is it on a narrow 
foundation; everything that affects and interests the human family 



54 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



has part and place in this great work. We recognize that while we 
have received revelations from the Lord for spiritual guidance, and 
divine truths pertaining to man's salvation here and hereafter, that 
reach beyond any revelations that have ever been given of the Lord 
in any former dispensation, nevertheless this people also are a very 
material people, having to do with material things. 

THE SAINTS MUST BE MATERIALLY AS WELL AS SPIRITUALLY STRONG 

We recognize the fact that this people must be materially strong 
and prosperous in order that they may attain the fulness of God's 
work and establish it as he would have it. It cannot be done with 
a people who are in financial bondage, or who are in distress. I 
am convinced that the day is coming, indeed it is here, and it will be 
more apparent to the generations that shall follow us, that the Lord 
has had just as keen an interest in bringing this people to material 
prosperity as to spiritual blessings, and spiritual prosperity. He has 
recognized the need of material assistance in the establishment of his 
work upon the earth in preparation for the coming of the Lord Jesus 
Christ. From the days of the Prophet Joseph Smith, the Lord has 
shown forth inspiration in material things for the blessing and sal- 
vation of this people. When he led this people to. these valleys of the 
mountains, he inspired his servant President Young to point this out 
as the place, and he said it was the place, it was not only the place for 
spiritual development and for laying the foundation or building upon 
the foundation that had already been laid for the establishment of 
God's work in the earth, so far as his Church was concerned, but it 
was the place for the material prosperity of his people. Yet it was 
not the place where they could get rich quick. Thank the Lord, that 
condition never has obtained and it never will* It is a place where 
there is an abundance, as has often been remarked, that the com- 
munities where the Latter-day Saints live are provided with more 
material blessings and natural resources than perhaps any other com- 
munity of a similar size in any part of the known globe; that we 
could be fenced out from the rest of the world and could survive in 
comfort, for the abundance of the things of the earth are here ; but 
they cannot be very easily obtained. They can only be obtained through 
great effort, great struggle and through faith and through the bless.- 
ings of the Almighty. 

FAITH AND WORKS REQUIRED 

I rejoice that it has required struggle, that it has required effort 
to the attainment of these material things. That in itself is a great 
blessing to the people. Likewise it has always been necessary that 
there shall be a combination of faith and works on the part of the 
people who wrest from these valleys and these mountains material re- 
sources for their blessing and benefit in a material way. I am glad 
that that is true, for it does seem to me, that we are in the very place 
where all the most desirable qualities of the human being — faith, 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 



55 



physical power, stick-to-it-iveness, devotion, self denial and persever- 
ance, all are developed by the very circumstances with which we are 
surrounded ; and it never will be possible for a lazy people, for an idle 
people, for a speculative people to prosper in these Rocky Mountain 
valleys. God will not allow the conditions to alter and change very 
materially from what they are. They will come by slow processes 
and through the faith and the diligence of the people. These ma- 
terial blessings will continue to flow untoi them in abundance; but I 
am pleading now, my brethren and sisters, that the Latter-day Saints 
shall give just a little bit more thought and consideration in seeking 
the Lord for material blessings. He is interested in your material pros- 
perity. He is concerned about it, and I am sure that he has heard the 
prayers of our fathers and mothers long before this day in these val- 
leys, and has made it possible for the wilderness to blossom as the 
rose. We have given him. credit for it. It is he who stayed the early 
and the late frosts, it is he who has altered the conditions under the 
faithfulness and the labors of the brethren and sisters, too, and has 
brought us this blessed condition that now obtains ; but I wish to say to 
you, my brethren and sisters, that our present material advantages and 
our maintaining them, all depend on our continual faithfulness. This 
will not be a land of Zion unto this people except this people shall pay 
their tithes and their offerings. There are blessings for which we 
depend upon the Lord. While we are anxious that we shall employ 
all the skill and the wisdom of man, and physical power and ability, 
in the accomplishment of these things, all the wisdom of man, all his 
physical power, all his genius, cannot succeed except God shall bless 
his labors ; and if he shall bless them, and if we shall be diligent, if 
we shall be anxious to do our part, I am sure the result will be all 
that is desired. 

THE KEY TO OUR LINE OF CONDUCT 

I would like to call your attention to a line of conduct that I 
think every Latter-day Saint ought to follow, even in material things, 
as well as spiritual. The key may be found in the ninth Section of 
the Book of Doctrine and Covenants. The, circumstances are these : 
Oliver Cowdery was translating, for God gave him the privilege, with 
the Prophet Joseph, to translate the Book of Mormon; and as he pro- 
ceeded, suddenly his ability to translate ceased. He was puzzled at it, 
humiliated, bewildered, and wanted to know why, and the Lord gave 
an answer. I am reading now from the 7th verse of that 9th section : 

"Behold, you have not understood; you have supposed that I would 
give it unto you, when you took no thought save it was to ask me. 

"But, behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; 
then you must ask me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause that your 
bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right. 

"But if it be not right you shall have no such feelings, but you shall 
have a stupor of thought that shall cause you to) forget the thing which is 
wrong; therefore, you cannot write that which is sacred save it be given 
you from me." 



56 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



That key can be applied in spiritual and in material things. I 
know it, and I am asking all you Latter-day Saints to employ just 
that process in your material affairs. When you contemplate the en- 
larging of your possessions, when you are studying the question as 
to what you should plant and what you should do, what you should 
buy and what you should sell; that is all vital after all, because if this 
people are wrecked financially it will be an exceedingly difficult thing, 
it will take a long time for this work to be accomplished, except there 
is material assistance available for the accomplishment of it individ- 
ually and collectively. So I am inviting you to study it out in your 
own minds. Yes, think about it and watch carefully the impressions 
of the Spirit. 

WHAT BRINGS SUCCESS? 

I have said this also : Success does not come from mind power ; 
the brain does not bring success. It is helpful, undoubtedly, but some 
of the wisest and some of the brainiest men in the world have been 
altogether wrong in the last few years. Surely it has been a time 
when the wisdom of the wise in material things has perished, and the 
understanding of the prudent is hidden and is not available ; because it 
has not been only the poor who have suffered, but those of large means 
in the world. The shrewdest bankers in New York miss it entirely, 
and their wisdom was not sufficient to meet the emergencies. Neither 
is it physical strength that brings material success and prosperity, 
for there are physical giants who are paupers, and they may be found 
everywhere. Neither is it hard work, alone by itself, that brings suc- 
cess. That is necessary ; brains are necessary ; physical strength is 
essential, and so is hard work; but all these combined may make a 
total failure. What is it that really brings success? It is doing the 
right thing at the right time. That is a very simple thing, surely, and 
yet it is true. Men in the world who succeed, if you ask them why: 
"Oh I got a 'hunch' that I ought to do so and so." We do not use 
that language and yet' we recognize that it is possible for a man or a 
woman to get an inspiration — an inspiration or an impression from 
the Lord who knows what is coming. He knows whether that thing 
is going to be successful this year or not. It is the easiest thing in the 
world for him to give men and women an impression that this is the 
thing to do. 

TAKE COUNSEL TOGETHER 

I have said that it is a mighty good thing for brethren to counsel 
with their wives about their material affairs, although some of us think 
that a woman does not have any reason for doing what she does do, 
only she just does it "because." It is usually because she is right, be- 
cause she gets the inspiration, sometimes much quicker than a man. 
She does not understand your problems, but somehow in her heart she 
feels "that is not right, that is not going to come out right," she doesn't 
feel good about it. It is a mighty good thing to take conusel to- 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD

gather. I have said if you do not do' it but go ahead on your own ac- 
count and use your own judgment and wisdom, setting hers aside, and 
you make a failure, you will hear about it for a long time afterwards. 
(Laughter.) 

CONSULT THE LORD AND HIS PRIESTHOOD ABOUT IT 

So that, it is a mighty good thing to utilize all the intelligence, all 
the wisdom we have in our circle among our boys and our girls. The 
decision does not rest wholly with father, but counsel is taken, and 
we study it out in our own minds and then we endeavor to reach our 
conclusion. Then, when we have reached it, wait a minute; do not 
go forward yet. My Scotch grandfather used often to quote this 
Scotch maxim : "Be sure you are right and then go ahead." Now I 
think we can be sure we are right. If we think we are right, the 
Lord has invited us to go to him and ask him if the thing we have 
planned to do, even in material things, is right. "If it is right, 
cause that my bosom shall burn within me, that peace shall be there, 
that contentment shall dwell, and I will have the conviction that it is 
the right thing. If it is not right, let there be a stupor of thought 
and an uneasiness, and my mind will not be clear on it, my heart will 
be turned away from it." If you do not get that conviction you would 
better try again. You'd better study it out again. But I am going to 
ask you to do something else. This Priesthood does not desire to 
bring the people of the Church under its direction in material things, 
but I want to tell you that this Priesthood is under the guidance of 
God Almighty ; I want to tell you that the man who presides over 
this Church, and those who have presided over this Church, are wiser in 
material things than any other men in this Church. God has made it so. 
His wisdom has prevailed and has been vindicated time and time again. 
Then here is a safe guide for this people : to take counsel from those 
whom the Lord inspires, and the Lord is the wisest financier: there 
is none like him, not only in spiritual, but in material things. 

And I assure you my brethren and sisters, that these stake presi- 
dents, the bishops of these wards, upon whom the hands of the ser- 
vants of God have been laid, and who have been blessed and set apart 
to be watchmen upon the towers of Zion, to be shepherds of the flock, 
are blest with and enjoy an inspiration for the blessing and guidance 
of the people that is of great value to them in spiritual and in material 
things. Go to your bishop, talk with him about it. "Well," one will 
say, "I will not do that. My bishop doesn't know as much about this 
business as I do. It would be a humiliation for me to go to him." 
He may not be very successful himself, but he is able to give you the 
right counsel and advice, and he will never direct you wrong. I 
heard "Uncle" Jesse Knight say upon one occasion — and you will par- 
don me referring to him, because I think he is a shining example in 
this respect, and you know he was exceedingly successful in mining 
enterprises — I heard him say that he never went into a venture in his 
life without going to see his bishop and having a talk with him about 



58 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



it. His bishop knew very little, I presume, about the particular in- 
dustries that Brother Knight was engaged in; but his testimony 
was : "The bishop never gave me wrong advice ; not once did he lead 
me astray or give me wrong advice or counsel. 

A RECENT VALUABLE EXAMPLE 

I want to bear witness, therefore, to you, my brethren and sisters, 
it has been manifest among this people since the last conference held 
here, that if this people would have listened more diligently than they 
have done to the counsel of the President of the Church and to the 
brethren who have visited you in the stakes and wards, this people 
would have been millions of dollars better off today than they are. 

Some of you think: "Oh, the President of the Church had a selfish 
motive" when he advised you to raise sugar beets, when he told you 
it was a good and profitable thing for you. I know that we visited 
you in your wards and stakes and pleaded with you to do the same 
thing, assuring you that it was a good thing for the people, irrespective 
of the industry itself or looking at it from the business investment point 
of view. Now, was it right? Was it right? You answer it! I tell 
you again, that if all the people had listened, they would have been, in 
the aggregate, worth millions of dollars more than they are today. 

Spiritual guidance in material things is a mighty good guidance; 
I know that. I ask, therefore, brethren and sisters, that you pay just 
a little 'bit more attention to the Lord and his help and his inspiration, 
through his servants and to you individually in these matters. Then 
I want to say to you that you can, if you have with all earnestness of 
heart paid your tithing and done so honestly and justly, you can go to 
the Lord with faith and claim his blessings and he will hear you, he 
will answer your prayers, he will stay the elements for your good, he 
will bring those blessings in abundance to maintain you and to liberate 
you from your difficulties, if this people will only listen to the counsel 
that has been given them. I am very anxious and very jealous that 
we shall succeed, for I know in the heart of President Grant and in the 
heart of his brethren is burning the desire that this people shall be 
prosperous. There is no selfish motive there at all. If it seems to be 
for one particular interest, after all, it is for the general good and the 
material welfare and prosperity of this people. 

HOW WE MAY BE SHELTERED FROM COMING STORMS 

I said that I rejoiced that we are here. I rejoice that the Lord 
has brought this people up unto the right place. He knew all about 
what was coming. He knows our present needs, he is anxiously wait- 
ing, patiently waiting, and is sometimes, I fear, almost disgusted with 
some of us because of our slowness, because of our stupidity, because 
we are dull students, and do not learn as fast as we ought to, yet he 
is patient with us. 

In conclusion I wish to read a few verses from the 115th section 
of the Doctrine and Covenants, in which I think I see, again, God's 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 



59 



watchcare and providence over this people in providing this place 
for us and these very conditions under which we live. Addressing 
the Church, the Lord says — reading now from the 4th verse of that 
115th section: 

"For thus shall my Church be called in the last days, even The Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 

"Verily I say unto you all: Arise and shine forth, that thy light may be 
a standard for the nations; 

"And that the gathering together upon the land of Zion, and upon her 
stakes, may be for a defense, and for a refuge from the storm, and from 
wrath when it shall be poured out without mixture upon the whole earth." 

Do you not know, my brethren and sisters, that God knew what 
was coming ; that he brought this people into these mountain valleys 
as a place of refuge when the storm shall come. We only hear the 
beginning of that storm. Dismal and distressful as has been its 
approach, while its thunders and its flashings have filled our hearts 
with terror, it is but the beginning of the storm. Oh, that it were 
passed, ahd that it were gone; but it is not, it is not! It would pass 
over the heads of this people and over the heads of the world if only, 
as Elder Roberts said, if only they would repent ; but if they will not 
repent, how can they escape ? Men in past ages have not escaped, who 
did not know as much as this generation, — in view of the knowledge 
that has come into the world of a scientific character, in view of the 
intelligence which men have, in view of the restoration of the everlast- 
ing gospel that has come into the world, and that has been proclaimed 
upon the housetops by the thousands of elders of this Church from 
door to door, in the publication of it, broad and wide. Knowledge such 
as no other generation that has ever lived upon the earth has enjoyed, 
has been diffused ; and this is their condemnation, that light has come 
into the world. I fear for the world because I say to you that no 
generation of men who have lived stand under greater condemnation 
before God Almighty than this generation, and except they shall re- 
pent, serious distresses await them. The storm in its fury shall rage; 
and all the powers of man cannot avert it. Only one thing can save 
them : their humiliation, their repentance will save them and nothing 
else can. Therefore we stand in peril, many of us ! for do you think 
that the Lord who has given us greater light and greater knowledge 
than the world, will pass us by in our sins and our transgressions? I 
say to you that if we do not live better than the world, if our stand- 
ard of morality is not in excess of theirs, if we do not observe the law 
and maintain it better than any other people, we ought to be ashamed 
of ourselves, and we shall stand under great condemnation before the 
Lord, because we know more than anybody else. The light and 
knowledge that the Lord has given to us place us in a very peculiar 
position, and if we are not careful the judgment of the Lord shall begin 
at the house of the Lord.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



HOW TO PREPARE TO ESCAPE THE DAY OF CALAMITY 

Oh may we put ourselves in order, put ourselves in perfect har- 
mony with the instructions of this conference, that we may escape, for 
I bear witness to you that those who do so, they shall escape in the 
day of calamity and confusion, as Israel escaped, the lintels of whose 
doors were marked with the blood of a lamb. So it shall be in these 
last days with those who do serve God and keep his commandments. 
May the Lord help us in the resolve and the determination to go for- 
ward now and do more than we have ever done to resist that which 
is all around us. It is in the world, it is seeking an inroad here and 
there into the communities of the Latter-day Saints. I am not very 
fearful of our present conditions, but I tell you I see what is coming. 
I know that it will require the steadfast faithfulness of every man 
and woman to escape the perils of this generation. God help us to 
stand as watchmen upon the towers of Zion, to guard well her gates as 
stewards of the flock, and to watch lest the destructive influences of 
the world shall enter in among us. Let us continue to be God's pe- 
culiar people, and we shall indeed be ; not only in time to come,.peculiar, 
but distinguished, which may the Lord grant, in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 

I earnestly desire, my brethren and sisters, that the rich inspiration 
of our heavenly Father may continue with us during the remaining 
portion of this meeting, as it has done during the first part of the 
meeting, and during the sessions that were held yesterday. 

Like Brother John A. Widtsoe, I have been and am intensely in- 
terested in education. I should like to talk to you about our religion 
class work, our seminary work, and our Church School system, but 
time will not permit. 

REMEMBER THE CHURCH EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS 

We have in Provo, the Brigham Young University. If I had 
the time I could tell you many good things about that splendid institu- 
tion. I should like to have you keep this great school in your remem- 
brance. Many of you have a good deal of property. Those who are 
comparatively rich sometimes wonder what to do with their holdings. 
I say to you, if you would have your name reverently remembered by 
the generations of Saints that are to come, you can do lfothing better 
with funds the Lord has given to you than to make an endowment of 
some sort to this splendid Church university. 

We have directors of other Church schools here, and they re- 
mind me that there are other Church educational institutions. I sug- 
gest that you remember all of these when you are disposing of and dis- 
tributing that which the Lord has given you of worldly goods.

Y. M. M. I. A. LIFE MEMBERSHIPS 

Not only am I interested in the educational work of the Church, 
but, as one of the general superintendency of the Young Men's Mu- 
tual Improvement Associations, I am also intensely interested in that 
great organization. There has been established for young men no in- 
stitution better than the Young Men's Mutual Improvement Associa- 
tion. Many have received training in this organization, who perhaps 
would like to make a slight contribution for its assistance. Some of 
you may probably not know that we have life memberships in this or- 
ganization. I appeal to you who have been blessed by attending Mu- 
tual Improvement Associations, to join the organization as life mem- 
bers. The charge for such membership is $5. Those who make this 
contribution give it to an endowment fund. The interest only on this 
endowment will be expended. This means that those who make this 
contribution will be helping this splendid organization for all time to 
come. 

OBEDIENCE TO LAW 

Now, this matter of obedience to law : The Lord has revealed 
to the Latter-day Saints that he, himself, raised up wise men who 
prepared the constitution of the United States. We believe it to be a 
divinely inspired document. Will it endure? Will this country of 
ours last indefinitely? 

I heard a great historian once say that he has studied ancient 
history with very great care in an effort to determine whether or 
not the United States of America, as a republic, will endure indefinitely. 
He said : "The republics of the past have failed. This republic can 
only endure, if in it there is some element not to be found in the re- 
publics of the past." This historian (Andrew D. White) explained 
further that a careful investigation shows that we have in this re- 
public one thing only, not to be found in other republics, and that is 
our great educational system. If after being trained in our, schools, 
men have the Christian spirit, if there is in their hearts some unself- 
ishness, if they are willing to make sacrifices for the good of others, 
then this republic may endure. 

REMEMBER THE LORI> — TAKE COUNSEL OF HIS SERVANTS 

On this subject of unselfishness, Brother Ballard has just men- 
tioned the matter of growing beets. He mentioned also the paying of 
tithes and offerings. What has your experience been in that direction? 
My experience has been that it is a paying proposition to remember 
the Lord. If we do this he will remember us. My experience also is 
tkat it pays to listen to the counsel of the authorities of the Church, 
to advise with the bishop. Suggestions though not given by Church 
authorities in a very vigorous sort of fashion, ought to be obeyed. Let 
me give you a specific case. I did not go to the President for ad- 
vice particularly, but when we were together, I .named, one, two, three,

four, five reasons why I ought to do a particular; thing. "Why," said 
President Grant, "Richard, I think this is the very time not to take 
the course you name." 

This was a financial! matter. He did not use a club. He did not 
talk loud. There was no compulsion about it, but it was advice to 
me. I took it and for so doing I have received a rather rich financial 
reward. 

I defy the Latter-day Saints to find anywhere, even in literature, 
a man more interested in a people than is President Heber J. Grant in 
your own good selves. Find, if you can, anyone, any man anywhere, 
who is more unselfish! His first interest, his last interest, his con- 
tinual interest is in the welfare of the people of the Church. 

CONDITION OF THE WORLD SINCE THE GOSPEL WAS RESTORED 

Now, to come back to our country — the United States. The con- 
stitution of this republic was prepared by men inspired of our heavenly 
Father. Its operations were only well begun when God the Father 
and his Son Jesus Christ came to the earth and restored this great 
gospel that is so dear to all of us. 

What has been the condition of the world since that time, since 
this gospel was restored ? Do you realize that in the methods of trans- 
portation there had been no progress in all the history of the ages up 
to the time the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was or- 
ganized? There had been no transportation faster than a man could 
run or a horse could travel. And what have we today ? The loco- 
motive, the ocean liner, the bicycle, the electric car, the automobile, the 
flying machine. These all are indications of the great progress that 
has come since this gospel was established. 

Many of you can remember when, every once in a while, the 
world was thrown into commotion by some terrible disease epidemic. 
There were epidemics of cholera, yellow fever, typhoid fever, diphtheria. 
The whole human family was powerless in the presence of these epi- 
demics. Micro-organisms had been discovered a hundred years before, 
but not until about 1880 did Louis Pasteur discover the relation that 
exists between these organisms, these germs, or these bacteria and dis- 
ease. During this hundred years there had been no progress what- 
ever in the health of the people. The death rate everywhere was in 
the neighborhood of forty per thousand. What a transformation ! To- 
day there are few cities in the world .in which the death rate is as 
high as twenty. Between 1876 and 1880, in one city, (Munich), 689 
out of every thousand babies under the age of one year were taken 
by death. That shows the condition of the world before 1880. Dirt, 
ugliness and disease were found everywhere. Since then cleanliness, 
beauty and health have taken their places. Science has discovered 
that the mosquito carries yellow fever from one individual to another. 
Science by destroying the mosquitoes in Panama made possible the 
construction of the Panama Canal. Some of you may not know that 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN

with the mosquitoes killed, with the ravages of yellow fever in that 
particular neighborhood ended, the United t States constructed the 
Panama Canal for less money than the French government expended 
investigating the question. 

PATRIOTISM AND RIGHTEOUS LIVING WILL CAUSE OUR COUNTRY 

TO ENDURE 

And so, too, has there been great progress in education. People 
are wiser, they know more, they have books and they are studious. 
This republic will endure indefinitely only if the individual citizens 
in it appreciate the liberty that has been left to us as a legacy by our 
fathers. The Bar Association, I have been advised, has suggested that 
throughout the whole country organizations be effected for the purpose 
of teaching the people patriotism. Others may desert the constitution 
of this country, but the Latter-day Saints will do it never. This great 
government will endure indefinitely if we, its citizens, give a proper 
value to that liberty which in those early days was purchased with the 
splendid blood of our glorious fathers. 

THE Y. M. M. I. A. AS HELPS TO GOOD CITIZENSHIP AND RIGHT' LIVING 

An effort is being put forth this year by the Mutual Improve- 
ment Associations to place the boy scout training within the reach of 
every boy of scout age in the Church. Imagine, if you can, what it 
means for every boy to be trained to be clean, to be obedient, to be 
gentle, to be frugal, to be honest, to be courteous, trustworthy, loyal, 
helpful, friendly, brave, clean, kind and reverent. Imagine what it 
means for all our boys to be taught these great lessons: "On my honor, 
I will do my best to do my duty both to God and to my country, to 
help other people at all times, to keep myself physically strong, mentally 
awake, and morally straight." I urge you, presidents of stakes, coun- 
selors to presidents, bishops, bishops counselors and other officials 
everywhere, to give to this great work your most loyal support. 

We have another equally important class in the Mutuals — the 
senior boys or young men between the ages of seventeen and twenty- 
three. We are determined as the General Superintendency and Gen- 
eral Board to so touch the lives of these young people as to thrill them 
with ambition. It does not take much in the life of a boy during these 
years to transform his whole career. We are not doing enough as 
officials if we only come to the meeting at the meeting hour, and there 
sing and preach and pray with those who happen to' be present. It 
is my duty, and yours, as officials, to go out and search for the lost 
sheep, to go out in the woods, to go out on the hill sides, to go out 
in the timber in a faithful, fruitful search for those who are unfortu- 
nate. It is the widow's son, it is the boy who is fatherless, it is the 
boy who is brought up in a broken home, it is the boy who is not 
having a fair chance, after whom we ought to search, it is he that 
we must find. These are they who need our special attention. These 
are the boys who need the help if they are to be saved. And so, I ap- 



64 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



peal to you, in the name of our great Country, and in the name of 
our glorious Church, to see to it that all boys between the ages of 
twelve and seventeen are given an opportunity of taking the work we 
offer in scouting, and that those between the ages of seventeen and 
twenty-three be hunted up and given the clean manly training of- 
fered for them by our Mutual Improvement organizations. These 
brought together and thus trained we shall have a generation of citi- 
zens who will have such love for American liberty, our country, and 
our constitution that the best in their lives will be given to support- 
ing our inspired institutions, to obeying unselfishly the law of the land 
and to making our nation live on indefinitely. 

THE SLOGAN OF THE (Jtf. I. A. 

The Lord bless you. I have enjoyed going out into the stakes of 
Zion where I have been associated with you splendid, clean, glorious 
Church workers. We have been teaching the Word of Wisdom these 
many years. We come forward now with a new or another appeal, 
a slogan. We want all the people, in their hearts, in their lives and 
in their actions, to be pure. 

We may think sometimes the Lord has deserted us, but really, 
if we think of our own shortcomings, if we think of how many people 
there are who drink their tea, how many people there are who drink 
their coffee, how many there are who do not remember the Lord in 
secret and in family prayers, who do not pay their tithes and their 
offerings, ought we then not to marvel why it is we are so richly 
blessed. It is our purpose to put forth this year our best effort to 
make our people pure, in their hearts, in their actions and in their lives 
generally, therefore nearly one hundred thousand strong, the Young 
Men's and Young Ladies' Mutual Improvement organizations are 
going forth this year proclaiming the slogan : "We stand for a pure 
life through clean thought and action." I wonder if you believe in 
this doctrine? I will repeat it and then give you an opportunity to 
say it with me for the whole Church. In this Church is to be found 
everything that makes people better, stronger, happier; better citizens, 
better supporters of our country, its laws and its constitution. I say 
again, others may desert it but the members of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints will defend it forever. 

I will give the new slogan and I ask you to repeat it: "We stand 
for a pure life through clean thought and action." 

(The Slogan was repeated by the congregation.) 

The Lord bless you. Amen. 

The congregation sang, "Now let us rejoice." 
The closing prayer was offered by Elder Heber Q. Hale, president 
of the Boise stake of Zion. 

The conference adjourned until 2 o'clock p. m.

AFTERNOON SESSION 

The meeting opened at 2 p. m., President Heber J. Grant pre- 
siding. 

The choir and congregation sang, "O My Father." 

The opening prayer was offered by Elder William T. Jack, presi- 
dent of the Cassia stake of Zion. 

The choir and congregation sang, "Guide us, O Thou great 
Jehovah." 

ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 

If I may be endowed with sufficient breadth of thought and some 
liberty of expression, I should like to speak for a few moments upon 
the subject of broad-mindedness. I am led to propose this subject 
for brief conisderation, not because I think it will be particularly at- 
tractive, but because my observation in the Church and out of it con- 
vinces me that something in the nature of definition and interpre- 
tation of that subject might be of advantage, particularly to a large 
body of young people within the Church. 

TWO DIFFERENT VIEWS 

There are many, both within the Church and without it who 
take the position that we are so circumscribed by tradition, practice, 
customs, and our reverence for that which has been established, that 
we do not lay hold of new thought, new ideas, and new practices, to 
carry forward this great work. There are also those within the Church 
who take a position almost directly converse, who say that we have 
gone so far beyond the initial understandings, the revelations, prac- 
tices and traditions, that we are in grave danger of straying away from 
the genius of the work. 

To my thinking, both of these, whose views I have attempted to 
give, fail in an understanding and a conception of the work, com- 
patible with its genius and its great ideals. I am not sympathetic with 
those who take some degree of pride in saying that they are not 
orthodox, while they believe in the main the principles of the gospel, 
they are liberal in their views, and feel at liberty to go beyond the con- 
ceptions and regulations which the leaders of the Church have held 
and sustained from its beginning until the present time. I am ortho- 
dox ; I am proud to be orthodox. I cannot conceive how one who is 
impregnated with the great mission of this work in the earth, and 
who is convinced of its truth and divinity, can be other than orthodox; 
and when I say I am orthodox, I do not, for one moment, contemplate 
a situation in which I am not receptive to all good new thought, to the 
development of true science, and to the extension of the application of 
the principles of the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ to all circum- 
stances which may arise in life.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BROAD-MINDEDNESS AND HERESY 

In my judgment, there is a vast difference between broad-mind- 
edness and heresy, and I sometimes think that often well-disposed 
members of the Church do no inconsiderable harm, among the young 
people of the Church, in particular, when they advocate a departure 
from some of the established rules, regulations and traditions of the 
Church, upon the principle of liberality of view and broad-minded- 
ness. It is one thing to be compassionate and sympathetic with him 
who sins ; it is another thing to compromise with or to sin, in the least 
degree, or tolerate sin. A marked distinction should always be drawn 
between our ideals and the weak human beings who try to live them. 

THE GOSPEL EMBRACES ALL TRUTH 

For my part, I construe the great principles of the gospel as 
being sufficiently broad and comprehensive to embrace all truth, and 
I circumscribe and limit their definition and operation, only by the 
broadmindedness of truth itself. Whatever is true, whatever is virtu- 
ous, whatever is of good report, lovely or praiseworthy, we seek after 
these things. 

HOW TO PRESERVE OUR STANDARDS AND IDEALS 

All people are subject to their environment. We react to the per- 
sons and to the influences which surround us. It is human so to do. 
We cannot live in the world without, to some extent, partaking of the 
things of the world. Every plant, every form of animal life are like- 
wise subjected to the influence of environment; they will respond to- 
light and darkness, warmth and cold, foulness and wholesomeness. 
We cannot associate with men and women all through the country, 
who have different ideals and different standards, without, in some de- 
gree, being influenced by such contacts. There is no possibility of a 
territorial isolation of the people of the Church. We mingle with 
strangers, we live in the same communities with those who enter- 
tain vastly different views from the ones we entertain. The only pos- 
sibility I see, is to maintain a great moral and religious isolation, or 
segregation, if you will, in order to preserve our own standards, our 
own ideals, and in order to safeguard our young people from the hazard 
that must ever be present with them as they associate and mix with 
the people of the world. We welcome the stranger within our gates. 
We recognize the fact that we will do business with him, but we do 
not welcome the influence of the world to dilute and weaken the great 
exalted principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ. 

1 look upon it as one of the greatest responsibilities we have, to 
maintain in their purity and in their absolute integrity, these principles 
of truth which have been committed to us for dissemination through- 
out all the world. Any solution into which is poured another solution 
loses some of its virtue, its strength and potency. You cannot pour 



ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 67 

the influences of the world into this great solution of the gospel with- 
out diluting it. It is our obligation to keep it undefiled, undiluted, 
and to maintain it in its present strength and purity and efficacy. 
Therefore, I feel fully justified in saying to those thoughtful, pro- 
gressive, admirable people within the Church who are not quite con- 
tent with present interpretations and procedure, be broadminded, but 
remember that the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ demand ab- 
solute and unvarying loyalty, adherence, and observance. 

BLESSINGS COME AS WE SUBJECT OURSELVES TO THE CONDITIONS 
UPON WHICH THEY ARE PREDICATED 

The very first section of the Doctrine and Covenants — that great 
section which is regarded as the preface to that work, and which I 
have often characterized as the charter of our religion, sets forth that 
Joseph Smith was called in order that faith might be increased among 
men, and, mark you this, which I regard as fundamental, in order 
''that mine everlasting covenant might be established." I construe the 
new and everlasting covenant as I would construe, in large measure, 
a legal contract. I believe that our Father intended that he would 
obligate himself as well as obligate the beneficiaries of that contract to 
the performance of it. I believe that no one is entitled to the full 
measure of its blessings unless he subjects himself to all the con- 
ditions upon which those blessings are predicated, and I construe 
that covenant to be broad enough to embrace every principle of the 
gospel, so that under that construction, no man or woman can be so 
broadminded as to fail to observe, in any part, any of the principles 
of the gospel, and claim the full reward promised to those who keep 
them all. 

BROADMINDEDNESS OFTEN CONFUSED WITH LICENSE 

Broadmindedness and liberality of thought and view are often 
confused with licentiousness and with liberty to do the things which 
are not in consonance with the principles and regulations of the 
Church. I am thoroughly satisfied that if our boys and girls attend- 
ing colleges and universities could be shown the gospel in all its 
great breadth of view ; if they could be made to understand that it 
will subserve their best interests in life, and that it embraces all that 
is good and true, they would not think that it is narrow, and they 
would not think that those who stand up to proclaim it and who 
contend for an observance of its principles, are contracted in their 
views and not willing to accept new truth. 

NEED OF ADEQUATE INTERPRETATION OF THE GOSPEL 

We need an interpretation of the gospel. We need an interpre- 
tation that appeals, and we do not need to contravene, in any manner 
any of the principles of the gospel, to make an appealing interpreta- 



68 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



tion. I plead for that interpretation to come through the auxiliaries 
cf the Church, as well as from the priesthood of the Church. I think 
it is the highest degree of misfortune when young folks, kindly dis- 
posed toward the gospel and the Church, are not given adequate op- 
portunity to understand it and to appreciate its great, beautiful truths. 

We have all been inspired by the testimonies which have been 
given during this conference. I have been thrilled as I have heard 
men stand in this pulpit and declare that they know that God lives and 
that Joseph Smith was his prophet. As I have heard their voices 
ringing and reverberating through this building, I have shaken and 
trembled with a sense of obligation, and with a great feeling of joy — 
an obligation in knowing that all my brethren and sisters must have 
the opportunity of understanding the gospel and coming to a knowl- 
edge of its truth and divinity in the same form and in the same fervor 
with which our brethren have expounded it and borne their testimonies ; 
and a great feeling of joy that that same testimony rests with me. I 
appeal to you, my brethren and sisters, you who manifest your great 
interest in the work of God, by coming here to the general conferences 
of the Church ; I appeal to you, not for your own good particularly, but 
for the good of the thousands and thousands who are not here, who 
cannot be thrilled and inspired by these glorious testimonies, to carry 
back the message of this great gospel to them, to make it appeal to 
them, to make them know that there is nothing narrow or constricted 
in it and that there is nothing in the way of their going forward with 
the utmost progression in the development of all truth, and in the 
understanding and comprehension of the great principles of truth 
which God intends should be revealed for the guidance and direction 
of all the human family. 

GOD GIVE US VISION" AND UNDERSTANDING 

God bless the young people. God give them vision and un- 
derstanding to see the great truth and beauty of this gospel, and God 
bless the older ones that they may be sympathetic, compassionate, 
kind, tolerant, merciful and loving, that these young people may not 
perish without the faith. I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE 

I think it well for us at times to look at ourselves and take stock 
to determine what we are, and this both as individuals and as an or- 
ganization. We may need a mirror to show just how we look as in- 
dividuals, and I pray you if you use one, be sure that it is a right mirror, 
unwarped, and that your eyes be clear, that we may see ourselves as 
we are. And it is well to look at the Church, not that we need sep- 
arate ourselves from it for the occasion, but to look at it impartially 
and get its proper perspective in relation to other organizations. 



ELDER JAMES E. T ALU AGE 



A PANORAMIC VIEW OF SOME ESSENTIAL POINTS IN CHURCH HISTORY 

If it were possible to show by means of panorama or the mov- 
ing picture, the essential points connected with the history of the 
Church of Jesus Christ, going back no farther than the apostolic dis- 
pensation of old, we would see first a scene of wondrous activity and 
sacrifice. The apostles, who had been ordained under the hands of 
Jesus Christ, and those who had been called into the council of the 
apostles afterward, and the seventies who had been marshaled for their 
work, and the bishops and the elders and the priests, teachers and dea- 
cons — these we see at work, going amongst the people and spreading 
the gospel, spreading it so thoroughly that Paul was able to say in 
his day that practically every soul had heard it, by which I under- 
stand that he meant that every soul had had a chance to hear of it, to 
learn something about it. As the scene changes we see there many 
others who followed in the footsteps of the apostles, so far as their 
energy and devotion and authority to labor was concerned. Then we 
see confusion coming into the Church, partly because of oppression 
and almost indescribable persecution from without, partly because of 
the threatening disruption from within. 

THE GREAT APOSTASY 

There was an apostasy, and a great one, not the first one by any 
means in the history of mankind, but a great falling away, an apostasy 
of individuals from the Church in countless numbers, and then the 
apostasy of the so-called church itself, turning away from the ways that 
had been laid down as the government of the church, corrupting the 
ordinances established by divine authority, pandering to the so-called 
philosophy of the day, introducing the elements of paganism and 
heathenism to make their worship more spectacular and more attractive, 
until we see as we look at the changing scene, that there is only the 
outward form of godliness and not one flash to tell us of the power 
thereof. 

THE PERIOD OF SPIRITUAL DARKNESS 

Then as tlie panorama moves, comes the period of darkness, 
spiritual and mental. For, mark you, the mind is an attribute of the 
spirit; and as spiritual powers dwindled, mentality became deficient 
and the dark ages loomed. The sombre cloud failed to arouse faith 
and trust, but deepened the gloom of unbelief. We see people strug- 
gling in the midst of darkness trying to get out of the jungle. Men 
were sent unto them to help, men of God, seeking to lead them back 
into the light, to some extent, but they had a hard time. The Church 
had become apostate and tyrannical. It had undertaken to rule by 
autocratic methods. It claimed the right to tell men what to do and to 
force them to do it on penalty of loss of life or limb, and the con- 
fiscation of their goods. It undertook to dictate unto nations, unto 



70 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



kings, what they should do, and professed to absolve subjects from all 
allegiance to their rulers if the rulers failed to obey the behest of the 
church so-called. 

THE LIGHT OF GOD IN THE RESTORATION 

The centuries passed and by and by a light appeared ; a glorious il- 
lumination broke forth ; and the word of God was heard again, for 
God the Eternal Father — I speak it without reservation or modifica- 
tion—that Being after whom we have been formed in physical, mental 
and spiritual image, did appear upon the earth unto the lad Joseph 
Smith. And with the Eternal Father stood the only Son whom he 
had begotten in the flesh, Jesus the Christ, who affirmed that the 
authority and power to speak and to act in the name of God was not 
at that time upon the earth. Then followed the promise that it should 
be restored and in time, even as the prophets of old had foreseen, angels 
came to earth ministering unto those who had been chosen, and be- 
stowing upon them by the same outward ordinance as was observed 
of old, by the laying on of hands, the power and the authority not 
only to speak but to act in the name of the living God, according to 
the order set forth. 

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has not sprung 
from any "mother church." The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints is no sect; it owes no allegiance to any other religious so- 
ciety, call it by the name pf church or what you will, on the face of 
the earth. It does not claim to possess the Holy Priesthood by direct 
and uninterrupted descent from Peter of old, but it does claim that 
Peter, accompanied by his associates James and John, the three who 
constituted the presidency in the organization of the apostolate of old, 
did come by instruction of the Lord and did confer upon men here 
upon the earth the authority they possessed and which they exercised 
in the flesh before their martyrdom. We speak that plainly. I know 
it shocks the ears of some who may not have prepared themselves to 
receive it ; and yet, wherein is the inconsistency ? We proclaim the 
fact and also proclaim that the apostasy was a reality ; and others 
admit it, theologians, scholarly men, and even churches. Though you 
have heard it before, I wish to draw your attention to that solemn 
declaration by the chief of the Protestant churches, the Church of 
England, made soon after the time of its creation — for it was created 
by act of Parliament. But there were wise men and good men num- 
bered in the organization, and that church declared, about the mid- 
dle of the sixteenth century, in its homily on the peril of idolatry, as 
follows : 

"Laity and clergy, learned and unlearned, all ages, sects, and degrees 
of men, women, and children of whole Christendom — an horrible and most 
dreadful thing to think — have been at once drowned in abominable idolatry; 
of all other vices most detested of God, and most damnable to man; and 
that by the space of eight hundred years and more." 



ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE 



71 



THE CHURCH OF GOD ESTABLISHED ANEW 

That, I take it, is good testimony as to the actuality of the apos- 
tasy. We proclaim the restoration which the prophets of old said 
should follow the apostasy. The Church of Jesus Christ has been 
established upon the earth anew, through the instrumentality of Joseph 
Smith the Prophet and his immediate associates in the ministry. It is 
the Church of Jesus Christ brought to earth again, established anew as 
had been predicted, I repeat ; and its mission is the preparation of the 
earth for the great consummation, the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. 

In this restored church has been placed, by divine ministration 
and ordinance, the authority of the Lesser and of the Greater — or of 
the Aaronic and of the Melchizedek Priesthoods, with the several of- 
fices thereof and the several duties, responsibilities and powers per- 
taining to each office as of old. 

THE NEW AND EVERLASTING COVENANT 

That it was and is something new, and yet something old, as it 
is in fact eternal, was set forth by the Lord in a revelation given in 
April, 1830, just after the organization of the Church. There were 
people who had joined other churches. Many of them had been 
and were devout. They had been baptized, some of them by sprinkling 
and some of them by pouring, but they called it baptism, and some of 
them by immersion ; and they raised the question as to whether they 
could not become members of this Church now by application and 
profession of faith alone, affirming that it was unjust that they should 
be required to be baptized again. In this claim they plainly forgot 
that the outward form of baptism can be performed by anybody, but 
that baptism as an ordinance acceptable unto the Lord requires the 
power and the authority of the Priesthood which he has given. There- 
fore the Lord said : 

"Behold, I say unto you that all old covenants have I caused to be 
done away in this thing; and this is a new and an .everlasting covenant, 
even that which was from the beginning. 

"Wherefore, although a man should be baptized an hundred times it 
availeth him nothing, for you cannot enter in at the strait gate) by the 
law of Moses, neither by your dead works. 

"For it is because of your dead works that I have caused this last 
covenant and this Church to be built up unto me, even as in days of old. 

"Wherefore, enter ye in at the gate, as I have commanded." 

I have read from Section 22 of the Doctrine and Covenants. Isn't 
that in line with the declaration our Lord made while he talked in the 
flesh, even the Christ, known as Jesus of Nazareth, who was ac- 
knowledged as a marvelous prophet whose teachings were full of wis- 
dom? On one occasion, amidst circumstances which the rest of the 
chapter will give unto you, he spoke these words recorded in the 
9th Chapter of Matthew, beginning with the sixteenth verse: 



72 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



"No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment, for that 
which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment, and the rent is made 
worse. 

"Neither do men put new wine into old bottles ; else the bottles break, and 
the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish ; but they put new wine into new 
bottles, and both are preserved." 

The Judaism of that day was a travesty on the law that God had 
given. Many believed in part of what Christ said, but they wanted to 
tack it on to the Judaism of the day ; they wanted to make the word of 
God conform to their philosophy, or with their sophistry, or with their 
man-made precepts, and the Lord warned them: Do not put a new 
piece of cloth on the old garment, it will tear it away and make a 
more hideous rent than there was before. Do not put that newly 
fermenting juice into old leathern bags, for that was the nature of 
the bottles of that day. You know how quickly old leather breaks. 
Don't put it into such bottles, for the fermentation will burst the bot- 
tles and the good wine will be lost and the bottles will be entirely 
ruined. There was to be no compromise with the semi-pagan doctrines 
of the day, nor was there to be any compromise between the principles of 
the gospel of Christ and the teachings of men not conforming there- 
with, the doctrines of men that have been evolved in the minds of 
men without the inspiration of the Holy Spirit — no compromise ! 

THIS CHURCH LED BY REVELATION AND INSPIRATION FROM HEAVEN 

We are tolerant, tolerant in the extreme. We grant unto every 
man the right to worship after his own conscience, even as we claim it ; 
but we do not compromise by the acceptance of the views of men in 
an attempt to mingle them with the doctrine of Christ, and call it all 
the word of God. The Lord has spoken and is speaking. I bear 
you solemn testimony that ever since the reestablishment of the Church 
in 1830, this Church of Jesus Christ has been led by inspiration and 
revelation from the heavens. This is the day in which you witness 
such. The Lord is not leaving his Church to itself. He is speaking 
in the ways best known to him, and inspiring and leading those whom 
you sustain as your leaders. Follow them and be safe. May the Lord 
be with us in carrying out the determination for a better life which 
we have formed in this conference, I pray, in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 

peter's advice to the saints of old 

"But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a 
peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath 
called you out of darkness into his marvelous light: 

"Which in time past were not a people, but are .now the people of God: 
which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy. 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH

"Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from 
fleshly lusts, which war against the soul ; 

"Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas 
they speak against you as evildoers, they may by our good works, which 
they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation. 

"Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: 
whether it be to the king, as supreme; 

"Or unto governors, as unto them* that are sent by him for the. punish- 
ment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well. 

"For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye mayi put to silence 
the ignorance of foolish men; 

"As free, and not using your liberty for a cloke of maliciousness, but 
as the servants of God. 

"Honor all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king." 

APPLICABLE TO SAINTS OF LATTER DAYS 

This advice which was given by Peter to the saints of a former 
dispensation is just as applicable in the dispensation of the fulness of 
times. It is true that we have been called out of the world to serve the 
Lord, that we have received from him, the restoration of the gospel 
and the priesthood, and have become a royal people. It behooves us 
as Latter-day Saints to keep his commandments, to walk uprightly, 
to honor the law not only of the land, and that we are under the 
necessity of doing, but also to honor the law of God, and that also 
we are under obligation to do. Through revelation from the Lord we 
have been informed that it is our duty to serve God, to keep his com- 
mandments, to be subject to the powers that be, until that time comes 
when he shall come to reign whose right it is to reign and shall subdue 
all enemies under his feet. 

OUR DUTY TO KEEP THE COMMANDMENTS 

Now, my brethren and sisters, the thing that I have in mind par- 
ticularly in reading this passage of scripture is to call our attention 
to the fact that it is required of us as it was required of the former- 
day saints to keep the commandments God has given us, that we may 
not, in the eyes of the Gentiles, those who are not members of the 
Church, be considered as people who are insincere. For this is the will 
of God, that with well-doing we may put to silence the ignorance of 
foolish men. Any man or woman in this Church who violates the com- 
mandments, though it may be one of the least, is doing injury not 
merely to himself or to herself, but to the entire body of the Church. 
We individually have in our care and keeping the good name of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and having that good 
name in our keeping, it is required of us that we walk circumspectly, 
that we be sincere in our conversation, in our deportment, in all that 
we do. A man may say that, if he violates one of these command- 
ments which have been given to the Church, he is injuring only 
himself, but that is not the case, for he is doing an injury to the entire 
body of the people, because the world will judge the Church by the 



74 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



acts of the members. I have no right to do wrong, and you have 
no right to do wrong, although we have our agency and the priv- 
ilege of doing right or wrong as we may choose in and of our- 
selves ; but we, as members of the Church, are under covenant and 
under commandment of the Lord to keep his law ; to observe his words. 
It is stated in one of the revelations that we are to "live by every word 
that proceedeth forth from the mouth of God." Moreover, in another 
of the revelations, the Lord has said : "If thou lovest me thou shalt 
serve me and keep all my commandments." I commend to you all 
that has been said, but particularly the remarks that were made here 
this afternoon by Elder Stephen L. Richards, because they appealed 
to me, and I feel as he does that it is required of me and of you as 
members of this Church to stand by that which God has revealed 
for the salvation of the souls of men. We have accepted it ; we have 
come out of the world, and have entered into the waters of baptism, 
and received the light and the truth of the everlasting gospel. 

HOW OTHERWISE WE MAY BRING REPROACH UPON THE WHOLE CHURCH 

Now if we fail to live in harmony with this light and pose as 
members of the Church, claiming a standing and yet violating the 
commandments God has given us, then we are doing an injury to the 
entire work and bringing reproach not merely upon ourselves but 
upon the entire body of the Church. 

Let me read to you another passage of scripture : 

"For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit; neither doth a 
corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. 

"For .every tree is known by his own fruit. For of thorns men do not 
gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes. 

"A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that 
which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth 
forth that which is evil; for of the abundance of the heart his mouth 
speaketh. 

"And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say? 

"Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them 
I will shew you to whom he) is like: 

"He is like a man which built an house, and digged deep, and laid the 
foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently 
upon that house, and could not shake it, for it was founded upon a rock. 

"But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that without a 
foundation built an house upon the earth; against which the stream did 
beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was 
great." 

NO RIGHT TO MEMBERSHIP, IF WE JUSTIFY VIOLATIONS OF THE 

LAW OF GOD 

What right have we to claim membership, to call upon the Lord, 
and do not the things' which he says? Therefore, if there are any 
among us who are violating even the least of the commandments of 
God and feel that they are justified in doing so, they are under con- 
demnation. Remember that it has been written in section one of the 
Doctrine and Covenants, that the secret acts of men shall be revealed. 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 



75 



The Lord has sent forth his gospel unto the world and the voice of 
warning is unto all people who are called upon everywhere to repent. 

"Wherefore," said he, "the voice of the Lord is unto the .ends of the 
earth, that all that will hear may hear: 

"Prepare ye, prepare ye for that which is to come, for the Lord is 
nigh ; 

"And the anger of the Lord is kindled, and his sword is bathed in 
heaven, and it shall fall upon the inhabitants of the earth; 

"And the arm of the Lord shall be revealed; and the day cometh that 
they who will not hear the voice of the Lord, neither the voice of his ser- 
vants, neither give heed to the words of the prophets and apostles, shall be 
cut off from among the people." 

This in substance was quoted to the Prophet Joseph Smith by 
the Angel Moroni on the night of that visitation ninety-nine years ago, 
when he quoted the 22nd and 23rd verses of the third chapter of Acts, 
which reads similarly. The angel declared unto Joseph Smith that 
the time was near at hand when this scripture should be fulfilled, in 
which it says that they who will not hear the voice of that Prophet 
shall be destroyed from among the people. Now that applies to the 
members of the Church as well as to those who are in the world. If 
we as members will not hearken unto the words of the apostles and 
the prophets and especially to this prophet referred to, who is Christ, 
then we shall take our places among the stubble and shall be de- 
stroyed by the brightness of his coming. The time is near at hand 
when the Lord will come in power, and shall cleanse the earth. We 
must not deceive ourselves. I think sometimes that we "are inclined 
somewhat to excuse the world in sin and to declare that the world is 
growing ibetter. I want to say unto you that the Lord will save the 
righteous, but not the wicked. His decrees have gone forth, and his 
anger is kindled against the wicked, and those who will not receive the 
fulness of the gospel. In Section 35 of the Doctrine and Covenants, 
we read : 

"And there are none that doeth good except those who are ready 
to receive the fulness of my gospel, which I have sent forth unto this 
generation." 

The time will come when they who will not receive this fulness 
shall be swept off and shall not stand, when he comes in his glory 
to reign upon the earth and take vengeance upon the ungodly. The 
tares are being bound in bundles to be burned. The wheat is being 
garnered into harns, and the day of separation is near at hand. Even 
the Church shall be cleansed, and those who are of the world, who are 
numbered among the members of the Church, will be cast out, and 
will find their place among those who are unworthy, where there shall 
be wailing and gnashing of teeth. Brethren and sisters, let us praise 
the Lord, keep his commandments, walk uprightly and humbly before 
him in all things, is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

A sacred solo was sung by Myrtle Orr, "How beautiful upon the 
mountains."

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

Brother McKay has been chosen to preside over the European 
Mission. Elder Whitney, the only one of the twenty-six General. 
Authorities who is absent from us today, has undergone a serious op- 
eration, arid on account of his weak condition he has been released to 
return home as soon as his health will permit. I am very pleased to 
announce to this audience that our last word from him is that he has 
left the nurses' home, that the wound has closed up, and that he is 
on the high road to recovery. 

ELDER DAVID O. McKAY 

It seems but a very short time indeed since I faced a similar 
audience, on my return from a very recent mission. The interval 
between that home-coming and the present time leaving seems very 
brief indeed. 

I am very sorry that Elder Whitney's ill health necessitates his 
release. I met him about ten months ago. He was doing excellent 
work and feeling apparently well, although he informed me then that 
he feared he would have to undergo an operation. I rejoice with 
you in the latest word that he is better, and I hope when I shall greet 
him, that I shall find him well on the road to his usual normal, vig- 
orous health, and I shall be pleased — I will assume it here — to take 
the best wishes of this magnificent congregation to him. 

During the few moments that I shall occupy this afternoon, I am 
going to ask you to become missionaries, and tbus render help to your 
sons and daughters who are in the mission-field. I am going to 
ask you to make their work more effective. 

TEXT 

"Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill 
cannot be hid. Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a 
bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in 
the house. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see 
your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven." 

THE CHURCH A CHURCH OF MISSIONARIES 

There are approximately two thousand men and women represent- 
ing this Church in the missionary field. There should be, in a gen- 
eral way, about two hundred and fifty times twb thousand missionaries 
in the organized wards and branches of the Church. 

.WHAT THE ^MISSIONARIES ARE PREACHING BY PRECEPT AND EXAMPLE 

These boys out in the field are sweet and clean and whole- 
some, and they are striving to live exemplary lives, that their example 
might accord with their precept. I have met them, as you know, in 
many missions, and, invariably, they are fit, noble representatives of 
their parents and of the Church. Their skin is clean, their eyes clear, 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKA Y< 



77 



their lives wholesome, and men and women who are opposed to our 
teaching's are forced to acknowledge that the missionaries of the 
Church are noble young men and pure women. O, I grant you there 
are men and women in the world who are suspicious, many who are 
suspicious of them. Sometimes, too, once in a great while — a mis- 
sionary man forgets himself and brings disgrace upon the body of 
the Church, but the percentage of such failures, thank heaven, is 
extremely small. The two thousand missionaries are preaching by 
"plain living and right thinking" the efficacy of "Mormonism." 

a summary of Christ's message to the world 
In addition to that, they are proclaiming a wonderful message. 
The other day I read, in a very carefully written book, on the life of 
Christ — a summary of his teachings to the world. The eminent 
writer said : 

"Christ came to the w,orld and gave to the world a message, which con- 
sists, first, in giving to men a true conception of God. Second, in teaching 
men how to attain a< larger and freer life." 

Then, basing the third message, or the third lesson upon the fact 
that a man's actions depend upon his motives, he draws this con- 
clusion that, 

"Christ's message meant the ultimate development of God's kingdom or 
rule upon earth, which is destined to transform society. Loyalty to the divine 
King — the common Father of all mankind, is the strongest arid only universal 
bond that can bind all men together. His teachings, therefore, have a large 
social, as well as individual significance, for they contemplate a universal 
brotherhood or democracy in which all men are united in the common desire 
to do the will of God." 

I think this a good summary of the message that your sons and 
daughters are giving to the world. They teach to all men a true 
conception of God. They invite the world to investigate the great 
declaration that God and his beloved Son have appeared in person in 
this dispensation. What a glorious message ! Second : they are teach- 
ing men the means of attaining a higher and freer and diviner life. 
Say what you will, that is their only purpose, and they prove their 
sincerity in it by leaving their loved ones, leaving their vocations, spend- 
ing their own money, or the hard earnings of their beloved parents, 
in trying to induce men to hear that message. Third : they can stand 
before the people of the world and say that "Mormonism" does con- 
template, in its ultimate consummation, the transformation of society; 
and who, conversant with world conditions today, will say that the 
time is not ripe for society to be transformed ! 

THE WORLD REJECTS THEIR MESSAGE 

But the world does not believe this message. We have heard in 
this conference about evil designing men and women, who say, in sub- 
stance, that our missionaries teach one thing, but the people prac- 
tice another at home. Such accusations but emphasize the importance 
of preaching to the world by example. It seems to me that this 
conference has been characterized by the gospel of application, and so, 



78 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



I feel in perfect accord with the spirit when I ask that you who con- 
stitute part of the two hundred, and fifty times two thousand mission- 
aries, in the organized stakes and branches of the Church, preach by 
example these glorious things — prove to the world that you are not 
only a God-fearing, but a God-trusting people. 

RESPONSIBILITY OF ORGANIZED BRANCHES AND WARDS TO EXEMPLIFY 
IN DAILY LIFE THE DOCTRINES AND PRINCIPLES OF THE GOSPEL 

If you ask me where I first received my unwavering faith in 
the existence of a God, I would answer you : in the home of my 
childhood — when father and mother invariably called their children 
around them in the morning and at night, and invoked God's bless- 
ing upon the household and upon mankind. There was a sincerity 
in that good patriarch's voice that left an undying impression in the 
children's souls ; and mother's prayers were equally impressive. 

I ask today that every father in the Church see to it that, in all 
sincerity, he impress his children with the reality of the existence of 
God, and with the reality that God will guide and protect his chil- 
dren. You carry that responsibility. Home is one of the units — 
the fundamental unit of society. Let the sincere investigators who 
believe more from what they see than from what they hear, find, upon 
investigation, that "Mormons" prove by example in the home, by de- 
votion, and in their service to God, that they believe and know that 
God is their Father. I knew before I heard my father testify that he 
had heard a divine voice, that he lived near to his Maker ; and I know, 
by a nearness to that same Eternal Father since, that father told the 
truth when he said he received in answer to prayer this admonition 
given in audible tones : "Testify that Joseph Smith is a prophet of the 
living God." Such is the reality of the true Latter-day Saints' con- 
ception of God the Father. 

IDEALS 

Secondly, I would ask that every parent in the Church teach men 
by example how to obtain a higher and freer life. Missionaries are 
pointing the way ; we should follow it. What a strength it would 
be to the missionaries, if they were able to point back to the thou- 
sands and thousands of villages and find in each a community that 
introduces into its life the higher and better things. We have heard 
much throughout this conference about the necessity of pure individ- 
ual living. We have heard that no Latter-day Saint can indulge in 
"boot-legging" with impunity. He is not only violating the law, but 
he is casting reflection upon his people and upon his nation. Latter- 
day Saints should uphold the officers in their efforts to ferret out 
these law breakers. No Latter-day Saint can enter into a gambling 
den without casting reflection upon his people and without violating 
the statutes of his state. A few gambling dens are still found, I 
am informed, in Ogden and Salt Lake City at least, and it behooves 
Latter-day Saints to stand by the officers in their efforts to close these 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY 



79 



places of vice. Latter-day Saints do not smoke. If your houses are 
contaminated with tobacco smoke, your appeals to God are not going 
to be very availing in the minds of your children. Pray to him to 
give you strength to overcome the habit, and I promise you God will 
give you that strength. I care not how viciously the habit is fixed 
in your body, God will not forsake you if you call to him in sincerity. 
Obedience to the laws of health, and of the Spirit will lead to the 
higher and freer life. 

Lastly, missionaries are preaching that the gospel is destined to 
transform society. We believe it and we believe that from an economic 
standpoint, from a social standpoint, from a spiritual standpoint, we 
can offer to the world today such practical ideals in organized so- 
ciety, that if applied to the world, would alleviate much of the suffer- 
ing and misery in this poor war-ridden, famine stricken, selfish world. 
Take for example the little simple work of your fast day ; your con- 
tribution to the poor. I remember mentioning that before an audience 
in New Zealand, at Auckland, about six hundred non-members being 
present. We took that as the theme because a day or two before the 
meeting a paper had published the fact that citizens had discovered 
some suffering women and children about whose condition nobody 
seemed to be aware. Following the meeting, a man said : "Do you 
really mean to say that every member of your Church is visited every 
month by some officer?" "Yes, that is the plan." "And that the 
amount contributed once a month on your fast day is sufficient to meet 
all the needs of the poor?" "Yes, that is the fact. All do not do it, 
however," I confessed. Ah, that is it. Don't you see — all do not 
comply. All do not come up to the standard. O, fathers and moth- 
ers, what an example to the world in economic salvation if we could 
only live up fully to this economic principle ! Let us determine here 
and now to raise the percent per capita, of our fast offerings. Let us 
raise it from twenty cents to a dollar. Though that is not what it 
should be, what a lesson to the distracted government in this war-torn 
world today! 

I was in Syria when some of your fast offerings came over there, 
and realized, as Brother Booth gave out relief to those suffering 
Armenians, that one hundred cents irn every dollar went to those 
poor people, because of the perfect organization of the Church. The 
• minimum overhead expense was not deducted from your contribu- 
tions. Let us return home from this conference determined to live up 
to this one principle, in addition to the many others that have been 
named. Then, as the boys and girls are preaching and bearing testi- 
mony to the efficacy of "Mormonism," they can, with pride, point 
back to the home ward and say, "You may find these principles ex- 
emplified there." Remember, "example is more forcible than precept." 
People look at you six days in the week to see what you mean on 
the Sabbath. 

Therefore, with this idea that we are giving to the world the 



80 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



same message which Christ gave, namely : leading the people to a 
true conception of God, their Father, teaching them how to obtain 
higher and freer life, bearing witness to them that it is possible in 
this day, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel, to 
transform society; let us resolve this day to "Be noble; and the noble- 
ness that lies in other men sleeping, but never dead, will rise in 
majesty to meet our own." In this way we can make our light so 
shine among men, that they seeing our good works may be led to 
glorify their Father in heaven." 

God help us to be near to him, for I testify to you he is ever 
ready to be near to us. 1 pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 

In one of the revelations of the Lord to his servant Moses, he 
made use of this expression: "Behold it is my work and my glory to 
bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man." As "eternal 
life" is here used, we understand it to mean exaltation with our heavenly 
Father in his Celestial kingdom. In order to accomplish this purpose, 
the gospel was instituted, which includes the atonement of our Lord 
and Savior Jesus Christ. The gospel is the plan of the Gods for the 
existence of this earth and of man upon it, of their fall, of their re- 
demption, and of their glorification, for not only is man to be re- 
deemed and glorified through obedience unto the laws and ordinances 
of the gospel and the effects of the atoning blood, of our Savior, but 
the earth also is to be renewed and receive its paradisical glory, and 
be prepared that the sanctified may dwell upon it. 

DISREGARD FOR LAW THE CAUSE OF THE DOWNFALL OF NATIONS 

The land of North and South America is a very much favored 
portion of our Father's footstool, and he has declared with his own 
mouth that it is a land of promise — a chosen land — above all other 
lands. His eye has been upon it. In the days of the confounding of 
the languages, at the tower of Babel, when that little band of men 
and women associated with the prophet Jared, and his brother sought 
the Lord that their language might be preserved, and that his favor 
might be extended unto them, he granted their desire and led them 
across the mighty waters to this land of America. They were given 
the promise that if they, on this promised land, should be faithful, 
it would be unto them a land of promise that should flow with 
milk and honey, but that if they did not serve the Lord, but engaged 
in wickedness, they would be swept off the face thereof. The history 
of this people, contained in the Book of Mormon, plainly tells us that 
because of their wickedness, notwithstanding they had become a mighty 
and a numerous people, they were swept from off the earth, through 
contention, warfare and strife, amongst themselves. 

Some six hundred years before the coming of our Lord in the 
meridian of times, Lehi, a great prophet, with Jeremiah and others, 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 



81 



preached the gospel to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, but his testimony 
was rejected and his life was sought. The Lord led him out, with 
a little colony, and across the waters, and settled them also in America. 

Afterwards, Mulek, with a colony from Jerusalem came to this 
country. These colonies were located in the southern part of North 
America, in Central America, and in the northern part of South 
America. And all this land, as well as' that into which they migrated 
to the north and to the south was designated by the Lord as the land 
of promise. Because of the wickedness of a part of the people of 
Lehi, they were cursed with a black skin and became a degraded and 
a loathsome people. These were called Lamanites, after their first 
leader in rebellion. The remainder of the people of Lehi were called 
the Nephites. In the course of time they also became wicked and 
contentious and were finally destroyed. I believe that the downfall of 
governments and the destruction of nations is a natural result from 
a disregard for law and government and for the principles of right- 
eousness. Let the nations be warned. 

NEED OF LIVING RIGHTEOUS LIVES 

As I have listened to the brethren speak upon the keynote topic 
as it has been characterized — obedience unto law, I have thought of 
and counted my blessings, and among them, have emphasized the 
blessing of being privileged to live here upon this land of America, 
and particularly within the confines of the United States, because it 
is a good country, but more than this, because of the government which 
God has given us in these United States. I do hope and pray that 
the people now inhabiting these lands will be brought to a realiza- 
tion of the necessity, for their own sake and the sake of their pos- 
terity, of living righteous lives and of seeking the God of this land 
and worshiping and serving him., that it may be unto us a land of 
promise — a choice land in very deed. 

I am thankful, too, for my home and the happy associations I 
have in these peaceful valleys of the mountains ; also for the pro- 
tection that is afforded us here; and for the peace we enjoy, for 
there is a peace felt here that is not felt all over these United States 
and in the other countries of the world. 

CLOSE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MAN AND THE EARTH, THE CHURCH 
AND THE NATION 

In speaking of the purpose of our Lord, the plan of salvation, 
the fall of man and of the earth, I desire to bring to your atttention, 
my friends and brethren and sisters, the close relationship existing 
between man and this earth. When man, through his disobedience, 
was cast out, the earth also was cursed for his sake, so* that instead of 
bringing forth, spontaneously, fruits, flowers, grains, grasses, etc., 
which were necessary to sustain the life of man and animals, it brought 
forth thorns and thistles, briars and obnoxious weeds, and it was only 
by the sweat of the face of man that those needful things were pro- 



82 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



duced. I believe, brethren and sisters, that there is a similar nearness 
existing between the Church of Christ, and the state, or the law of 
the land and the law of God, particularly as regards to the United 
States and the government thereof. I do not think that the Church 
should undertake to control, or to dictate in state affairs, or vice 
versa, but I do think that the Church and the State alike, should 
strive to make the people, the citizens of the nation, and the member- 
ship of the Church, an industrious, prosperous, law abiding, peace- 
able, and righteous people. The Church needs the protection which 
the state or the government affords, and the government needs the 
influence of the Church upon the lives and conduct of its citizens. 

One of the articles of faith of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints, says: "We believe in being subject to kings, 
presidents, rulers and magistrates, in obeying, honoring and sustaining 
the law." Behig subject to kings and presidents? Yes. Rulers and 
magistrates? Yes. By reason of the franchise which is given us as 
citizens of these United States, we have a responsibility and a priv- 
ilege ; we have the electing, either directly or indirectly, of those who 
preside over us, who are our officers and our servants, and it is the 
duty of every citizen of the United States to use his franchise and 
his opportunities, to have men elected to office in the city, in the 
county, in the state, and in the nation, who will fairly represent the 
people. They should, themselves, be Saw-abiding citizens. They 
should have the common good of the people at heart. They should 
be philanthropic, unselfish, having a desire to use their talents, and 
if need be, their means, at least to do their part in the support of the 
government, and working for the common good of all. They should 
be righteous men, so that they may receive help from God, and he 
delights to help those who are righteous and who are engaged in a 
righteous cause. He has declared by his own voice that he redeemed 
this land by the shedding of blood, and therefore it should be re- 
garded as a sacred and hallowed land. By men who were raised up 
of the Lord and inspired by him, the constitution of these United 
States was given to us, and all the laws enacted should be in conformity 
therewith. 

A DUTY IN SELECTING LOYAL OFFICERS AND SUSTAINING THEM 

It is God's government; he has given us an inspiration in regard 
to government, and it is an example to all the world. I see no reason 
why a senator of the United States, a governor of a state, a legis- 
lative assembly, the judges upon the bench, or other officers should 
not be so true, loyal, and righteous that God would give to them in- 
spiration to guide them in their work; and if they are men of this 
character we will support and sustain them; and the institutions of 
our country, and the liberties and freedom of the people will be pre- 
served and protected. 

We have a duty in the electing of these officers, and then when 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 



83 



they are elected, we have a duty to support and sustain them. It 
matters not, when the President of these United States is elected 
and takes the oath of office, and bears the responsibility of his ad- 
ministration, whether he is a Republican or a Democrat, all are bound 
to support him in his position. If he does not magnify his calling 
according to his oath of office, I suppose he may be impeached, but 
until he is, he is our president and we should speak well of him at 
home and abroad ; likewise with the minor officers — the governors of 
states, the mayors of our municipalities, etc. 

WE BELIEVE IN HONORING AND SUSTAINING THE LAW 

We believe in honoring and sustaining the law. That to the 
Latter-day Saints, is a principle of the gospel. The Lord has given 
us that and it means that he expects us, as members of his Church, 
to uphold and sustain the law, and to be obedient unto it, and when 
we violate the laws of the land, we violate the law of God, and we 
are not good Latter-day Saints; we are not worthy representatives 
of this religious body, and we have no right, in ourselves, to disre- 
gard the obligations resting upon us as members of the Church. When 
men are elected to office, where it becomes their duty to enforce 
the law, it is their religious duty, as well as a civil or political duty, 
to enforce the law according to their understanding of it, and the 
powers given them so to do. And so, we believe in upholding and 
sustaining the law and the authorities of the law, giving them our 
moral support and all the support we have to give, and thus we main- 
tain the integrity of the government of the United States and of 
the state to which we look for protection in those things which are 
dearer to us than life itself — liberty and the right to worship God 
according to the dictates of our conscience. 

So I say, the State needs the Church and the Church needs the 
State, and together we should work harmoniously to these ends. In 
doing so, we are helping God, the eternal Father, in the great aim and 
purpose of all his works, and that is the saving of the souls of men 
in his kingdom. 

May the Lord add his blessing, I pray, in Jesus name. Amen. 

Elder Melvin J. Ballard, of the Council of the Twelve, sang, the 
congregation joining in the chorus, "Who's on the Lord's side, who?" 

President Heber J. Grant gave notice of overflow meetings to 
be held on Sunday at the Assembly Hall and the Bureau of Informa- 
tion, and stated that this was the first time in the history of the 
Church that people had been obliged to stand in the aisles of the 
building on the week days of any general Conference. 

Benediction was pronounced by Elder U. G. Miller, president of 
the Cottonwood stake of Zion. 

Conference adjourned until 10 o'clock, Sunday morning, Oct. 8. 



THIRD DAY 



The conference met on Sunday morning, October 8, 1922, at 10 
a. m. There was not an available seat in the building, unoccupied and 
hundreds were standing in the aisles, and remained during the ser- 
vices. The Assembly Hall was also packed with people, and there 
were over three thousand, in attendance at the Bureau of Information, 
with many standing at the doors of the Tabernacle. 

President Heber J. Grant presided. The choir and congregation 
sang, "Praise to the man who communed with Jehovah." 

The opening prayer was offered by Elder Henry H. Blood, 
president of the North Davis stake of Zion. 

A sacred duet, "Hail to the brightness of Zion's glad morning," 
was sung by J. R. Boshard and Sarah Ramsey. 

PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 

I sincerely desire, my brethren and sisters, during the few mo- 
ments which I may occupy this morning, of the time which is allotted 
to us, that I may be sustained by your faith and prayers. I feel my 
dependence upon the Lord, possibly as I have never felt it before, be- 
cause the older I become, the greater my experience, the more I come to 
realize that the power of God, our Father, alone can make us strong. 

THE CREATION 

"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth." 

If the chronology of the Bible is correct — and I know of none 
better — nearly six thousand years have elapsed since the declaration 
which I have read was made, and which is the first paragraph from 
the book of Genesis. It will be observed that this statement, like all 
others made by the Lord, is a definite, abstract declaration of fact. 
It is not stated as a theory, a thing which may or may not have been, 
depending upon the opinions of man for proof. 

God created man in his own image, in the image of God created 
he him, male and female created he them, and said unto them be fruit- 
ful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it, and have 
dominion over every living thing that moveth upon the earth. 

The story of the creation of man, and the purpose for which he 
was placed upon the earth, is told, not in its fullest detail, of course, 
in the brief scripture from which I have quoted. Of the story of 
man during the Adamic dispensation, we know but little. The his- 
tory of one thousand five hundred years and more is told in the Bible 
on ten short pages, and modern revelation gives us but brief account 
of the happenings between the creation and the deluge.

MAN GOVERNED BY CONTRARY POWERS 

This much, however, is made clear to us : That from the earliest 
period of his existence until the present man has lived a dual life, 
has been governed by one <of two influences, each diametrically op- 
posed to the other. From the beginning these two powers have striven 
for the mastery, one leading men on to higher ideals, teaching faith, 
hope, charity, 'patience, love, self sacrifice, humility, righteousness and 
justice. The other leading men away from these divine ideals, teach- 
ing selfishness, personal ambition, love of power, disregard for virtue, 
chastity, equality and self sacrifice. 

One teaching that man is the offspring of Deity, created in the 
image of God, and placed upon the earth endowed with intelligence 
to discern between good and evil, between right and wrong, and that 
the Creator would hold him responsible for the use he made of the 
agency which had been bestowed upon him. The other teaching that 
man is responsible to no power other than that which he himself has 
created, and that his future state is not influenced by, nor dependent 
upon, allegiance to, or acknowledgment of a supreme being. These two 
influences were manifested soon after our first parents were placed 
upon earth. 

From God, our Father, through his Only Begotten Son, came 
teachings which, if adhered to, would lead man back into the pres- 
ence of the Father, and redeem him from the transgression into which 
he had fallen, because he had listened to Lucifer, a son of the morn- 
ing, who had rebelled against God, and because of his rebellion had 
been cast down with his angels, banished from the presence of the 
Father, and had become Perdition, destined to fight against God, to 
be the father of lies, and the enemy of all that is good. 

Notwithstanding the fact that the Father talked with Adam, mak- 
ing plain to him that he would provide, through his Only Begotten 
Son, a Savior, and means by which redemption would come to his 
posterity, as the people multiplied they refused to listen to his teach- 
ings, and came to love Satan more than God. <, 

ENOCH SENT TO CALL THE PEOPLE TO REPENTANCE 

Before the birth of Seth, who was i obedient to the teachings of 
his father, Adam, and became a preacher of righteousness, the peo- 
ple had become sensual and devilish. Cain had learned, through the 
teachings of Satan, 'that by taking the life of his brother Abel he 
could become possessed of his flocks and herds, he had been taught 
that by combining in oath-bound societies power could be obtained by 
the shedding of blood, and war 'and bloodshed prevailed among the 
people. 

At this time the Lord sent Enoch to call the people to repentance, 
and he 'went forth testifying to the redemption which would come in 
the meridian of time, through the atonement which was to be made 
by the Only Begotten of the Father in the flesh, but they refused to 



86 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



listen, and so great 'was their opposition to Enoch, and enmity toward 
those who accepted his word, that it became necessary for the Lord 
to take them from the earth. 

iTHE PROPHECIES AND WORK OF NOAH 

Again the Lord sent his prophet to warn the people, and rescue 
them from the power of Satan, who held them imbondage. Noah, who 
was the son of Lamech, who was the son of Methuselah, who was 
the son of Enoch, went among the people (prophesying that except 
they renounced their (allegiance to Satan, and returned to the Lord 
they would be utterly destroyed. Again the message fell upon deaf 
ears, only Noah and his sons, and their families being saved when the 
windows of heaven were opened, land the floods covered the earth. 

Thus the first effort made by the Lord to teach his children the 
plan by which they might be redeemed, and brought back into his 
presence, had 'failed, so far as the great majority was concerned, one 
thousand five hundred and fifty years after they had been placed 
upon the earth. 

After having witnessed this great manifestation of the power lof 
God, and the result which is inevitable to those who follow after 
Satan, for he sooner or later leads people to death, sone would think 
that the lesson would always be remembered. Noah and his sons 
went out from the ark humbled and convinced, for they had witnessed 
the destruction of their race, but the lesson was soon forgotten. Two 
hundred and fourteen years after the ark rested on jMount Ararat 
the people were again traveling in the broad road which leads to 
destruction. They had again turned from the worship of the true 
God to the worship of idols. 

THE CALLING OF ABRAHAM AND THE RISE OF ISRAEL 

At this time there occurred an event which was to have a more 
direct effect upon you and me than any which had hitherto transpired. 
From his home in Chaldea the Lord called Abraham, and taking him 
up into Palestine entered into covenant with him, that notwithstand- 
ing the fact that he was a childless man, he would make his posterity 
innumerable, and would give Palestine to him and his children for an 
everlasting inheritance, and that through him all of the nations of the 
earth would be blessed. 

In fulfilment of the word of the Lord Isaac was born to Abraham 
and Sarah, and he became the father of Jacob, who was the father 
of the twelve patriarchs, the founders of the twelve tribes of Israel. 
Again the keys of the Priesthood were conferred upon men, again 
the prophets declared the great plan of human redemption, again the 
law of sacrifice was restored by which the people were taught that an 
infinite sacrifice would be provided, by which they were to be re- 
deemed from death, because He who was to come would be the first 
fruits of the resurrection from the dead. 

At one time it appeared that the word of the Lord would not 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. WINS 



87 



be fulfilled, for Israel left Palestine, and went into Egypt, where for 
a period of more than two hundred years, the greater part of the 
time in servitude, they adopted the customs and idolatrous worship of 
the Egyptians. But the purposes of the Lord were not to be frus- 
trated, and he called his servant Moses who led Israel out from the 
Egyptian bondage, and back to the promised land, the land which the 
Lord had given to their father Abraham to be an everlasting in- 
heritance. 

ISRAEL, UNDER DAVID AND SOLOMON, A DOMINANT NATION 

The Lord again showered blessings upon the people, until under 
David and Solomon, their prophet kings, they became one of the 
dominant nations of the world. 

During the Israelitish period the Lord again raised up prophets 
who testified, as prophets had testified in earlier dispensations, that 
the Lord would send, through the lineage of David, the Messiah, 
who would be the Redeemer of the world. Isaiah prophesied that a 
virgin would conceive and bear a Son, whose name should be called 
Immanuel, and that he would take away the sins of the world. 

The time had come when the Lord was again to offer redemption 
to the people, when another gospel dispensation was to be ushered in, 
the effect of which would be of greater importance than any which 
had gone before, or would follow after. The appearance of prophets, 
warning the people to turn from the service of Satan, and serve the 
Lord, was not its outstanding feature. The Lord himself, in the 
person of his Only Begotten Son, was to come to earth, that through 
him unconditional redemption from death might be wrought out for 
all mankind, and forgiveness for personal sin assured through obe- 
dience to the doctrines of the gospel which he would teach. 

The Jewish people, blinded by the teachings of men, because of 
their prejudices, their traditions, their pride and faithlessness, failed 
to recognize in Jesus Christ, Shiloh, to whose coming they had long 
looked forward, influenced as they were by Satan rather than by the 
Lord, as generations before them had been. 

THE COMING AND THE MISSION OF CHRIST 

In vain the Redeemer pleaded with them, in vain he wept as he 
gazed upon the holy city, and contemplated the ruin which must in- 
evitably come. In vain he warned the people of the consequences 
which would follow rejection of his word. The power of the Almighty 
which was manifested in his works, the love of God exemplified in 
his ministry, none of these things could move hearts made adamant 
by the power of the evil one. 

Christ was persecuted, ridiculed, his message rejected, and finally 
he was put to death by the most ignominious process known to man, 
and that by his own people whom he had come to redeem. In part 
his mission had failed, but the great purpose of his coming had been 
accomplished, for the bands of death had been broken, the prison 



88 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



doors had been opened and the captives set free, death could no 
longer forever hold captive the spirits of men. 

CHRIST REJECTED BY THE JEWS 

The Church which Christ and his disciples established struggled 
heroically for existence, but the evil one so dominated the minds of 
men, persecution was so intense, that the keys and power of the 
Priesthood were withdrawn, the ordinances of the gospel changed, un- 
til the Lord ceased to recognize the Church as his. 

The prophets had foreseen and declared all of these conditions. 
They saw the dispersion of Israel, the suffering of the Jewish people, 
because of their rejection of the Savior, who had been sent for their 
redemption. They looked forward to a time which they all desired 
to see, a day when the Lord would set his hand for the last time to 
redeem his people, when Satan would be bound, be banished from 
the earth, and his power to tempt mankind, and lead them on to 
destruction, cease. 

A NEW GOSPEL DISPENSATION 

It was a period when a new gospel dispensation was to be ushered 
in, when the Lord would again offer salvation to the people of the 
world, when he would gather in the outcasts of Israel, when he would 
prune his vineyard for the last time, restore the keys of his Priest- 
hood, and consummate the work which had been commenced in the 
beginning. When he would send his Only Begotten Son to earth 
again, this time to reign as King of kings, and Lord of lords. 

The time, the place, the manner of this restoration were plainly 
outlined by the prophets. It was to be in the latter days, the dis- 
pensation of the fulness of times ; a time when Satan would rage 
in the hearts of the children of men, when men's hearts would fail 
because of fear, when there would be war, and rumors of war, when 
the sea would heave itself beyond its bounds and the whole earth be 
in commotion. 

At such a time a light was to break forth among those who sit in 
darkness, which light was to be the fulness of the gospel of the Lord 
Jesus Christ. This gospel, the Lord himself declared, shall be 
preached in all the world, as a witness unto all people, and then shall 
the end come. 

THE GATHERING FORETOLD 

The place to which scattered Israel was to be gathered was plainly 
indicated. It was not to be upon the islands of the sea, not upon the 
broad plains nor in the open vallies, but in the tops of the mountains, 
in a country which had been regarded as a barren waste, where the 
desert would be made glad because of those who were to redeem and 
convert it into fruitful fields. To such a place people from all na- 
tions were to flow, that they might be taught the law of the Lord, 
and learn to walk in his paths. 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. WINS 



89 



That a work could be inaugurated, having for its purpose the 
conquest of sin, the subjugation of Satan, and his final banishment 
from the earth, without resistance on his part is not to be expected. 
Knowing that the hosts of heaven were being marshaled for the last 
great struggle between the powers of light and darkness, of good and 
evil, of right and wrong, he has fought, as never before, to defeat 
the purposes of the Almighty. 

THE PERSONAGE WHO INAUGUARTED THE WORK 

When the time came for the opening of the present gospel dis- 
pensation, Joseph Smith, who was to be made the instrument through 
whom the work would be inaugurated, moved upon by the Spirit of 
the Lord, went into the woods to pray. The effort made by Satan 
to prevent the accomplishment of the purposes of the Lord, is told by 
Joseph Smith as follows : 

"After I had retired to the place where I had previously designed to go, 
having looked around me, and finding myself alone, I kneeled down and began 
to offer up the desires of my heart to the Lord. [ had scarcely done so 
when I was immediately seized upon by some power which entirely overcame 
me, and had such an astonishing influence over me as to bind my tongue, so 
that I could not speak. Thick darkness gathered around tme, and it seemed 
to me for a time that I was doomed to sudden destruction. But exerting all 
my powers to call upon God, to deliver me out of the power of this enemy 
which had seized upon me, and at the very moment when I was about to sink 
into despair, and abandon myself to destruction, not to an imaginary ruin, but 
to the power of some actual being from the unseen world, who had such 
marvelous power as I had never before felt in any being, just at this moment 
of great alarm, I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head, above the bright- 
ness of the sun, which descended gradually until it fell upon me. 

"It no sooner appeared than I found myself delivered from the enemy 
which held me bound." 

THIS RESTORED GOSPEL OF THE KINGDOM TO BE PREACHED IN 
ALL THE WORLD 

This gospel of the kingdom was to be preached in all the world, as 
a witness to all people. In 1837 Heber C. Kimball, Orson Hyde and 
others were sent to Great Britain to bear the message of the restoration 
to the people of that country, which was to contribute such strength to 
the Church. They arrived there on the 20th of July. Converts were 
made to the divinity of the mission of Joseph Smith, and a time ap- 
pointed when the ordinance of baptism was to be administered to those 
who had accepted the truth. Sunday was the day when this or- 
dinance was to be solemnized. 

EFFORTS OF THE EVIL ONE TO PREVENT THE PURPOSES OF GOD 

The efforts put forth by the evil one, to prevent the accomplish- 
ment of the purposes of the Lord, on the night before the Sunday in- 
dicated, is told by Heber C. Kimball and Orson Hyde, as follows. 
Heber C. Kimball says: "While I was thus engaged I was struck 
with great force, by some invisible power, and fell senseless to the 



90 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



floor. The first thing I remembered was being supported by Elders 
Hyde and Richards, who were praying for me. I then arose and sat 
upon the bed, when a vision was opened to our minds, and we could 
plainly see the evil spirits who foamed and gnashed their teeth at us. 
They came toward us like armies rushing to battle." 

Orson Hyde, in a letter written to Heber C. Kimball, at a later 
date, says : "Every circumstance which occurred in that scene of 
devils is just as fresh in my recollection as it was at the time of its 
occurrence. While you were apparently senseless and lifeless upon the 
floor, and on the bed, after we had laid you there, I stood between 
you and the devils and fought them face to face, until they began to 
diminish in number and retreat from the room." 

EFFORTS AND METHODS ADOPTED BY THE EVIL ONE TO THIS END 

Failing in his endeavor to prevent the restoration of the gospel, 
and the organization of the Church, the evil one has concentrated his 
efforts to prejudice, by falsehood and misrepresentation, the people 
• of the world against the truth. Misrepresentation, persecution, in 
some instances death, have followed the elders of the Church where- 
ever they have gone, and not* satisfied with the effort put forth among 
the people of the world, Satan has, by every strategy known to him, 
endeavored to lead away from the Church those who have entered 
into covenant with the Lord that they will serve him, and keep his 
commandments. 

The means which he employs for the accomplishment of his pur- 
poses, are many and varied. Permit me to read from the Book of 
Mormon : 

"Wo unto them that turn aside the just for a thing of naught, and revile 
against that which is good, and' say that it is of n|D worth ! For thie day shall 
come when the Lord God will speedily visit the inhabitants of the earth; and 
in that day when they are fully ripe in iniquity they shall perish. 

"But behold, if the inhabitants of the earth shall repent, of their wicked- 
ness and abominations they shall not be destroyed, saith he Lord of Hosts. 
For the kingdom of the devil must shake, and they which belong to it must 
needs be stirred up' unto repentance, lor the devil will grasp them with his 
everlasting chains, and they be stirred up to anger against that which is good, 
and perish ; for behold at that day shall he rage in, the hearts of the children of 
men, and stir them up to anger against that which is good. 

"And others he will pacify, and lull them away into carnal security that 
they will say : All is well in Zion ; yea, Zion prospereth all is well, and thus 
the devil cheateth their souls, and leadeth them away carefully down to hell. 

"And behold, others he flattereth away, and telleth them there is no hell, 
and he sayeth unto them, I am no Devil, for* there is none, and thus he whis- 
pereth in their ears, until he grasp them with his awful chains, from whence 
there is no deliverence." 

SUGGESTIONS FROM THE ENEMY OF RIGHTEOUSNESS 

Have you, my brethren and sisters, experienced the effect of 
these various efforts of the evil one to shatter your faith ? Has he 
ever whispered in your ear, when you have gone to the Lord in prayer, 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. WINS 



91 



that there was no one to hear and answer you ? At times when your 
prayers have not been answered, as you may have desired, has his 
voice whispered to you that it was useless to pray? Has doubt and 
uncertainty entered your minds where faith and hope had been be- 
fore? Has he attempted, by flattery and praise of the world to per- 
suade you that you are great and strong, and do not need the strength 
which comes from the Lord? Has he filled your heart with ambition, 
thirst for wealth and power, banishing from you the spirit of humility 
and self-sacrifice, without which it is impossible to please the Lord? 
Has he whispered in your ear that violation of the law of chastity is 
not a grave offense, that you may lie a little, steal a little, take ad- 
vantage of one because of his words, that you may disregard and vio- 
late the law of the land, or the law of the Lord, and be- justified ? 

All such suggestions come from the enemy of righteousness, to 
whom I have made reference, and to whose strength and power I 
have desired to call your attention in my remarks. If we transform 
the mental pictures which are photographed upon our minds by this 
power, into actions, we are in the grasp of Satan, from which only 
sincere repentance can rescue us. 

' HOW SHALL WE FORTIFY AGAINST THESE SHAFTS OF EVIL? 

By what process may we be fortified and made impregnable against 
these shafts of the enemy? We must put on the armor of righteous- 
ness, and keep it constantly bright in the service of the Lord. We 
must keep in constant communion with him through prayer. 

Prayer is the key which opened this gospel dispensation, it is the 
channel through which the Son communed with the Father, through 
which Saints were strengthened to endure, and rejoice in persecution, 
the gateway through which the repentant sinner may find his way 
back to God. 

Are the Latter-day Saints forgetting this obligation which they 
owe to the Lord, this one source of strength against the power of 
Satan? Are we regular in our family prayers, do we go to the Lord 
in secret, and put our trust in him in all of the activities of life? Let 
these presidents of stakes, these seventies, bishops, ward teachers and 
Church members who are present ask themselves these questions, and 
answer them. Let me again read briefly from the Book of Mormon : 

"Therefore may God grant unto you, my brethren, that ye may begin to 
exercise your faith unto repentance, that ye begin to call upon his holy name, 
that he would have mercy upon you. 

"Yea, cry unto him for mercy; for he is mighty to save. 

"Yea, humble yourselves, and continue in prayer unto him. 

"Cry unto him when ye are in your fields, yea, over all of your flocks. 

"Cry unto him in your houses, yea, over all our household, both morning, 
mid-day, and evening. 

"Yea, cry unto him against the power of your enemies. 

"Yea, cry unto him against the devil, who is an enemy to all righteousness. 

"Cry unto him over the crops of your fields, that ye may prosper in them. 

"Cry over the flocks of your fields, that they may increase. 



92 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



"But this is not all; ye must pour out your souls in your closets, and your 
secret places, and in your wilderness. 

"Yea, and when you do not cry unto the Lord, let your hearts be full, 
drawn out in prayer to him continually for your welfare, and also for the 
welfare of those who are around you." 

My brethren and sisters, these words of the Lord apply to us 
today, as they applied to those to whom they were delivered in times 
gone by. The power of the evil one is not broken; he rules the world 
today. The lust for power, ambition, selfishness, class distinction, 
the hatred of one race toward another, all of these things are inspired 
by the same influence which led away our first parents. 

HOW WE MAY KNOW THE WILL OF GOD 

A person said to me the other day: "What is the use of trying? 
The will of the Lord will be done, anyhow." 

The trouble, my brethren and sisters, is that the will of the Lord 
has never been done, from the beginning to the present, so far as it 
applies to the people at large. It was not his will that the people 
should perish in the flood. He repeatedly called them to repentance, 
and promised that destruction should be stayed, if they would only 
return to him. 

It was not his will that Israel should be scattered, and the Jewish 
people suffer as they have, it was because of their transgression. It 
is not his will that turmoil, war and bloodshed prevail in the world 
today. These conditions are all because of lack of faith on the part 
of the people, and because they refuse to listen to the voice of the 
Lord, as it has come to us through his servants, the prophets. 

The Lord has repeatedly called the people to repentance, has re- 
peatedly said that redemption might come, if they would return to 
him, and renounce their allegiance to the evil one. In this dispensa- 
tion he has said that Zion might have been redeemed had the faith of 
the people been sufficient. 

It is true that the Lord has decreed certain definite unchangeable 
purposes, and these he will accomplish. How may we know, then, 
the will of the Lord, and distinguish between his works and those of 
Satan? The key is a simple one. Everything which persuades to do 
that which is good, is from the Lord. Whatever is evil, and persuades 
men to do that which is not good, is from the evil one. 

REPENTANCE NECESSARY 

Have not we, ourselves, been witnesses of the inevitable results 
which come to those who follow after Satan? Never before in mod- 
ern times, and I believe not in ancient times either, has the necessity 
for repentance been more plainly manifest than in our day. 

THE NATIONS HAVE AGAIN REFUSED TO LISTEN TO GOD'S CALL TO PEACE 

It was not the will of the Lord that we should become involved in 
the greatest war the world has ever known, it is not his will that the 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 



93 



nations are divided and in strife today, that war clouds are again gath- 
ering which threaten the peace of the world, and the very existence of 
civilization. It is because men refuse to listen to the voice of the 
Lord, who is calling them to peace, and good will one toward the 
other. Peace can be established at any moment, it could have been 
established long ago, if the people of the world would only unite in 
a determined effort to prevent war. Ridicule it as you may, make 
light of it, oppose it, the fact remains that never in the history of 
modern time, has such opportunity been held out to the people for 
the establishment of peace, as that which has come in our day. 
Humbled, in sorrow and mourning, when the time came that war 
might have been forever suppressed, when conditions might have been 
established which would have made war impossible, the nations re- 
fused to listen. 

Again they started in the broad road, which leads to destruc- 
tion. Again selfishness, pride, love of power, the exalting of one 
nation above another, one race above another, menaces the world, 
and the civilization which is upon it. 

MAY THE TIME SOON COME WHEN THE WORLD WILL TURN FROM 

EVIL TO GOOD 

God grant that the time may soon come when the people of the 
world will learn, from the experiences of the past, which we seem 
slow to profit by, that it rests with them, with us, to turn from all 
that leads us away from the teachings of the Redeemer, to turn from 
evil to good, lest God's judgment come upon the people of the world, 
and they be so humiliated and decimated that there will be none to 
offer resistance, when the time of redemption shall finally come. 

God bless you, my brethren and sisters, fortify us against the 
power of the evil one, make us strong in righteousness and good works, 
that we may be accepted of the Lord, and keep our feet planted 
firmly in the path which leads back into his presence, I humbly pray, 
through Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem by Evan Stephens, "Let the mountains 
shout for joy.'' 

The choir and congregation sang, "Praise God from whom all 
blessings flow." 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

The evidence of the "decline" ( ?) of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints is seen in this vast audience. When I was one of 
the junior members of the Council of the Twelve, we never held an 
overflow meeting Sunday morning, because this building held all of 
the people. Today the Assembly Hall is crowded to overflowing ; peo- 
ple are standing here, and we have an overflow meeting on the grounds 
in front of the Bureau of Information, because the assembly hall in

that building will not hold the Saints. I am informed there are three 
thousand people on the outside. 

ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 

I trust, my brethren and sisters, that the spirit that has character- 
ized this gathering, and the other sessions of this conference, may con- 
tinue to the end, and that I may be a partaker of it to the extent 
that my tongue may be loosed and that the inspiration of the Lord 
may flow through me, during the time I stand here. I feel my weak- 
ness, and I sense the responsibility that attaches to one who is called 
to address the members of this great Church, in a general conference. 

We have, during the splendid sessions that we have attended, 
received many instructions. There has been running through all the 
discourses, that which was given to us by the President in his open- 
ing address — the keynote, if you will, of this conference — "Obedience," 
not only to the laws of the land, but to the word of the Lord. Our 
heavenly Father has made it very plain to us in our day, that no man 
hath need to break the law of the land in order to follow the teachings 
of our heavenly Father. On the contrary, he has made it obligatory 
upon us that we should observe the law of the land. 

A BLESSED LAND IN WHICH WE LIVE 

I find in the Doctrine and Covenants, section 101 :76-80, the 
following : 

"And again I say unto you, those who have been scattered by their 
enemies, it is my will that they should continue to importune for redress, 
and redemption, by the hands of those who are placed as rulers and are 
in authority over you — 

"According to the laws and constitution of the people, which I have 
suffered to be established, and should be maintained for the rights and 
protection of all flesh, according to just and holy principles; 

"That every man may act in doctrine and principle pertaining to 
futurity, according to the moral agency which I have given unto him, that 
every man may be accountable for his own sins in the day of judgment. 

"Therefore, it is not right that any man should be in bondage one to 
another. 

"And for this purpose have I established the Constitution of this land, 
by the hands of wise men whom I raised up unto this very purpose, and 
redeemed the land by the shedding of blood." 

Brethren and sisters, if there is any doubt in your minds about 
this being a blessed land in which you live, and that an all-powerful 
hand controls its destinies, remember that it was the Lord himself who 
raised up wise men to give to us our Constitution — the greatest pala- 
dium of human rights that any people have ever known. 

A LAND HIDDEN FOR THE LORD TO PEOPLE 

There are those who would destroy the Constitution of this land ; 
and there are some who would rejoice if they could overthrow this-

Nation, not realizing that our heavenly Father has given us the best 
government on earth. No loyal member of this great Church will 
raise his voice against the government, but he will be found uphold- 
ing it; he will be found praying for those who have been exalted to 
the office of presidency and for those who make the laws, under the 
Constitution. He will petition his Father in heaven for the governors 
and legislators of States, and for all those who are chosen from time 
to time to administer the laws that are calculated to continue unto us 
our liberty that they may be wise and just and exemplars to the 
people. If you are doubtful as to the interest of our heavenly Father 
in the settlement of this land, read in the first chapter of 2nd Nephi 
in the Book of Mormon, where the Lord says that it had been his 
purpose to keep America hidden from the other nations until he was 
ready to have it peopled. Read also from the Book of Mormon, I 
Nephi 13:10-19: 

"And it came to pass that I looked and beheld many waters; and they 
divided the Gentiles from the seed of my brethren. 

"And it came to pass that the angel said unto me : Behold the wrath of 
God is upon the seed of thy brethren. 

"And I looked and beheld a man among the Gentiles, who was sep- 
arated from the seed of my brethren byt the many waters; and 1 beheld 
the Spirit of God, that it came down and wrought upon the man: and he 
went forth upon the many waters, even unto the seed of my brethren, 
who were in the promised land. 

'And it came to pass that I beheld the Spirit of God, that it wrought 
upon other Gentiles and they went forth out of captivity, upon the many 
waters. 

"And it came to pass that I beheld many multitudes of the Gentiles 
upon the land of promise; and I beheld the wrath of God, that it was upon 
the seed of my brethren; and they were scattered before the Gentiles and 
were smitten. 

"And I beheld the Spirit of the Lord, that it was upon the Gentiles, 
and they did prosper and obtain the land for their inheritance; and I be- 
held that they were white, and exceedingly fair and beautiful, like unto 
my people before they were slain. 

"And it came to pass that I, Nephi, beheld that the Gentiles who had 
gone forth out of captivity did humble themselves before the Lord; and 
the power of the Lord was with them. 

"And I beheld that their mother Gentiles were gathered together upon 
the waters, and upon the land also, to battle against them. 

"And I beheld that the power of God was with them, and also that 
the wrath of God was upon all those that were gathered together against 
them to battle. 

"And I, Nephi, beheld that the Gentiles that had gone out of captivity 
were delivered by the power of God out of the hands of all other nations." 

This refers to Christopher Columbus and the Pilgrim Fathers. 
It was the Lord that inspired that little band of people who crossed 
the mighty ocean and landed at Plymouth Rock, because they desired 
to worship him according to the dictates of their own conscience. He 
watched over them and safeguarded their descendants and those 
who followed them to America, and in due time, there came an oppor- 
tunity to establish liberty such as humankind had not known before. 



96 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



The Lord raised up Washington, and with him that body of men 
who fought valiantly to establish for us in this land a government for 
which surely we are all grateful. 

OBEY THE LAWS ; SEEK THE LORD, AND KEEP HIS COMMANDMENTS 

Do not be deceived by evil minded men who would destroy your 
happiness. Seek the Lord in prayer and he will hear your petition 
and inspire you aright ; and we have need of his guidance in these 
days. We read in the Doctrine and Covenants, 46:7-9: 

"But ye are commanded in all things to ask of God, who giveth lib- 
erally; and that which the Spirit testifies unto you even so I would that 
ye should do in all holiness of heart, walking uprightly before me, con- 
sidering the end of your salvation, doing all things with prayer and 
thanksgiving, that ye may not be seduced by evil spirits, or doctrines of 
devils, or the commandments of men; for some are of men, and others of 
devils. 

"Wherefore, beware lest ye are deceived; and that ye may not be de- 
ceived seek ye .earnestly the best gifts, always remembering for what they 
are given; 

"For verily I say unto you, they are given for the benefit of those who 
love me and keep all my commandments, and him that seeketh so to do; 
that all may be benefitted that seek or that ask of me, that ask and not 
for a sign that they may consume it upon their lusts." 

Our feet have been planted upon this sacred soil for a wise pur- 
pose. This land has been dedicated for the blessing of mankind. 
The Constitution and the laws that have been enacted under its pro- 
visions are calculated to insure liberty, not license, to all who dwell here. 
This Church with which we are identified, stands, if it stands for 
anything, for the perpetuation of the liberties of all mankind. We 
should not listen to those who find pleasure in teaching sedition. 
Neither should we follow those who claim to be citizens of this land, 
who go about violating the laws that govern it. There are many who 
are failing to do their duty as citizens who have the right of franchise, 
but who are unworthy of that blessing that has come to those who 
live in this wonderful country. 

President Ivins has very beautifully portrayed to us this morning 
the condition of the world, and has pointed out that the trouble is that 
men have apostatized from the gospel of Jesus Christ. They have set 
up churches of their own. Men have assumed, of their own wisdom, 
to point the way, and they have forgotten the teachings of the Creator 
and in their pursuit of the gifts of our Father in heaven, — they have 
forgotten the giver. 

Upon you men of Israel — to whom the Priesthood of the Holy 
One has been given — there rests an obligation. You must serve the 
Lord and keep his commandments. It matters not what others may 
do, but for you there is only one course, and that is to be obedient 
to law, and to sustain the Constitution of this great land, and to sus- 
tain those influences and powers wherever they may be, that are 
calculated to uplift the human family.

OBEDIENCE ENJOINED 

Our heavenly Father has given unto us this information, in the 
Doctrine and Covenants 130:18-21. 

"Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will 
rise with us in the resurrection. 

"And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life, 
through his diligence and obedience, than another, he will have so much the 
advantage in the world to come. 

"There is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations 
of this world, upon which all blessings are predicated — 

"And when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that 
law upon which it is predicated." 

There should go forth from this great Church an influence in- 
tended to leaven the whole lump. We have received knowledge and 
information that our Father's children elsewhere know not of. We 
are in the position of Noah, who, in his day, went to and fro in the 
world, proclaiming the truth, calling all men to turn from the error of 
their way, warning them of the impending judgments that would 
fall upon them if they failed to repent; but, in due time those who 
refused to reform, their lives and failed to listen to that servant of the 
Lord, became absolutely unfit to inhabit this earth and they were 
overwhelmed by the flood, while the eight who were righteous were 
preserved from that awful calamity. 

REPENTANCE A KjE&IEDY FORI THE! ILLS OF THE WORLD 

History has repeated itself many times — children of God who 
have followed his teachings have been preserved, and those who have 
refused, have gone into darkness and have been destroyed. Take the 
American Indians as another illustration. Their ancestors were a 
white and delightsome people, brought away by the Lord before the 
destruction of Jerusalem, in order that they might have an oppor- 
tunity to develop upon this favored land. Because , they refused to 
keep the commandments of God, because they disobeyed the law and 
determined to be a law unto themselves, they retrograded and were 
cursed with a dark skin and became the unfortunate race that wan- 
dered over this great western hemisphere for generations, before the 
coming of the white man. 

The Lord has watched over this land, he directed Columbus to 
these shores, he led the Pilgrims here, he established the Constitution 
of the United States, and through the Prophet Joseph Smith, restored 
the everlasting gospel to bless the children of men, and if they will 
accept it and obey it, it will be the salvation of the human family. 

There is no other remedy for the ills of this world but repentance ; 
there is no preservation from the evils that will overtake mankind but 
on the score of righteousness. Unless men turn to the Lord history 
will repeat itself and destruction overtake the wicked. You already 
know that and understand it — you, upon whose heads have been laid 



98 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

the hands of the servants of the Lord ; upon whom have been be- 
stowed the holy Priesthood — you realize that God will not be mocked 
and that it is our duty as men of Israel to go in love and in kind- 
ness and with charity to all men, and divide with them this glorious 
message that has been given to us in this latter day. 

OUR DUTY TO PREACH THE GOSPEL OF PEACE 

We read in the 23rd chapter of St. Matthew, where the Savior 
foresaw the calamity that was coming upon his people and was greatly 
distressed. He said : 

"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets and stonest 
them which ar,e sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy 
children together, even as a hen gathered her chickens under her wings, 
and ye would not!" 

O that this great Church, with power that has been given to it 
of God, might be able to more rapidly disseminate the truth, and save 
the nations from destruction. We are growing rapidly, as an organ- 
ization, but I rejoice not so much in the increase numerically as I do 
in the belief that the influence that we radiate is being felt for good 
and that our Father's children, from the north to the south, and from 
the east to the west, are hearing the message of life and salvation, 
without which they cannot dwell in the presence of the Redeemer of 
mankind. ' 

ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S IMPORTANT MESSAGE 

President Abraham Lincoln, in one of his important messages, 
gives to us this remarkable advice : 

"Let every American, every lover of liberty, every; well-wisher to his 
posterity, swear by the blood of the revolution never to violate, in the 
least particular, the laws of the country, and never to tolerate their vio- 
lation by others. As the patriots of 76 did to the support of the Dec- 
laration of Independence, so to the support of the Constitution and laws, 
let every American pledge his life, his property, and his sacred honor. 
Let .every man remember that to violate the laws is to trample on the blood 
of his fathers and to tear the charter of his own and his children's lib- 
erty. Let reverence for the laws be breathed by every American mother to 
the lisping babe that prattles on her lap. Let it be taught in schools;, in 
seminaries and in colleges. Let it be preached from the pulpit, proclaimed 
in the legislative halls, and enforced in courts of justice — in short, let it 
become the political religion of this nation." 

That was the voice of him now stilled in death, who gave his life 
because of his desire for the perpetuation of the liberty that was guar- 
anteed under the Constitution of the United States. He was un- 
afraid. When the duty was placed upon him to battle for the liberties 
of mankind, he dedicated his life to that purpose, and in due time, our 
Father in heaven accepted his offering, and his name is emblazoned 
upon the pages of history as a great and noble man who dared to 
do right, and his praises will be sung and his virtues extolled through- 
out all time.

FREE AGENCY OF MAN 

It was the Master who decreed that men must have faith, and we 
are told that without faith we cannot please him. It was the Master 
Who declared that all men must repent, and sent his disciples into 
the world to cry repentance. It was the Savior who gave to us the 
gospel of Jesus Christ that bears his name, that declared that all men 
must be baptized. It was the same blessed Redeemer who said : "If 
I go not away, the Comforter will not come," and after he had left 
them, there came upon his disciples the Holy Ghost. Faith, repent- 
ance, baptism by immersion, (for that was the form of baptism that 
our Master received) laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy 
Ghost, as taught by him, are the requirements in his Church that all 
men must subscribe to if they would obtain celestial glory. Men may 
refuse to accept this opportunity. We have our agency and can 
please ourselves, but the Lord says in the Doctrine and Covenants 
93 :31 : 

"Behold, here is the agency of man, and here is the condemnation of 
man; because that which was from the beginning is plainly manifested unto 
them, and they receive not the light." 

That is the trouble with this world — the holy scriptures are filled 
with the teachings of a kind and merciful Father that are not appre- 
ciated, and today there are hundreds of the elders of this Church 
going to and fro in the world, pleading for a hearing that they may 
be able to point out the pathway of life and salvation. This is our 
Father's work. The gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored to the 
earth for the last time. It will never be taken away or given to an- 
other people, and upon us devolves the responsibility and obligation to 
so live that wherever we go, or whatever we do, our light will shine 
in such a way that others, observing our upright lives, will be con- 
strained to seek after the Redeemer of mankind, and to become identi- 
fied with his Church, in preparation to living with him eternally. 

That the Lord will strengthen our hands; that our voices may 
be made powerful in truth ; that the Holy Ghost may remain with 
the elders of this Church to inspire them to greater effort that to the 
very ends of the earth all men may have an opportunity to know 
that this is God's work, I ask in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER REED SMOOT 

I never felt so humble, and my weakness more than at this mo- 
ment. I never felt better in the work of the Lord, in my life, than I 
do at the present time. I have never enjoyed a general conference of 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, as I have enjoyed the 
present one. Beginning with that remarkable sermon delivered by our 
President, the opening day of the conference, down through all of 



100 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



the speakers, I have had in my heart an echo of gladness and approval 
that has indeed made me feel that life is worth living. 

THE TEACHINGS OF MOTHER 

I do not know why it is, but from the opening session of this 
conference, I have thought of my mother, perhaps more times, from 
that moment until this, than any other time since she was called to 
the beyond. I had a chance, last night in my dreams, to thank her — 
her boy thanked her — for the teachings that she gave and instilled in 
my heart when I was but a boy. It seems that I can hear her voice 
ringing out now ; it seemed in my dreams but last night that I could 
hear her pleadings to me, and her sound counsel and wise advice. I 
remember so' well that she used to impress upon me that no person, 
whether he be baptized into the Church or not, can retain a testimony 
that God lives, without he asks of Father in heaven, in humility and 
prayer, to give him, and help him maintain that testimony and the 
love of the work. She used to tell me that if I did not have a testi- 
mony, then, that Jesus is the Christ, the way to get it was to pray to 
God constantly and in earnestness, and she promised me — my mother 
promised me, — that the Lord God would give it to me in due time, if 
I kept myself unspotted from the sins of the world. That promise 
came true, not perhaps in the way that I intended it should come; 
not in the way that I expected it must come, to satisfy my soul, but 
it came in God's own way, and there is nothing that I appreciate so 
much in all the world, and I shall never cease asking my God to help 
me as long as I live, to maintain that testimony and be true to God's 
work and cause here upon this earth. 

Her slogan was: "Be true to yourself, be true to your country, 
and be true to your God; and no matter what happens to you, the 
end will be success." I hardly understood it then. I did not know 
what it meant, but, thank God, I know what it means today, and I 
testify to the people here, and in all the world, that if you will be true 
to yourself, true to the covenants you have made with God, true to 
your country, there can be no danger that will in any way, shape or 
form, bar you from receiving the blessings of God and the plaudits 
of all honorable men. 

POSITION OF THE CHURCH TOWARD THE GOVERNMENT OF 
THE UNITED STATES 

When President Grant was reading section 134 of the Doctrine 
and Covenants, that section in which is contained the declaration of 
the Church regarding our obligations to our government and the laws 
of the same, I could not help but think back some twenty years — a 
mere span of time — when I was charged with being disloyal to my 
government. I was charged with taking an oath, as a Senator of 
the United States, that was inconsistent with the oath that I had taken 
as a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 



ELDER REED SMOOT 



101 



Nothing ever hurt me so much. I knew, in my soul, that I would give 
my life, not only for my Church but for my Country, if necessary. I 
knew there was no man living that was more loyal to the constitution 
of the United States, her laws, her institutions, than I, unless that 
man had greater power and greater wisdom given him. And, at the 
hearings of the case, as they dragged on from month to month, and 
from year to year, I remember well the late senator, Philander C. 
Knox, of Pennsylvania, a member of the committee on Privileges and 
Elections of the Senate, coming to me one morning and asking me 
if the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints believed in our 
form of government. I told the senator we believed that the con- 
stitution of the United States was an inspired instrument from God ; 
we believed that the men who drafted and put it into force were in- 
spired and directed by the overruling hand of God. He said, "Have 
you any declarations to show your belief?" I called his attention 
first to the 12th article of our faith. I read it to him, but it hardly 
satisfied him — that short statement — and he asked if there were not 
some written, published statement of the Church, showing its attitude 
toward the government and the laws of our land. I said: "Senator 
Knox, I will see that by tomorrow morning, you will get a copy of 
the Doctrine and Covenants, and I ask you to turn to section 134 and 
read the section, and you will find there a clear, concise, straight- 
forward statement of the position of the 'Mormon' Church, so-called, 
toward the government of the United States and the laws of our 
country." It satisfied him. I had no more loyal supporter than the 
senator from Pennsylvania. 

THE POWER OF PRAYER 

My brothers and sisters, I want to acknowledge before you this 
day that during all of that troublesome time, I recognized the hand 
of God in it all. It was not Reed Smoot that they were fighting — it 
was the Church of God, and I want also to acknowledge to the people 
here today, that no greater power came to me from any source than 
from above, through the constant and earnest prayer for assistance 
from above. 

I wonder whether the world today believes in prayer, as they did 
in the early days of our country. The prayer of an honest man 
availeth much. I wonder whether our own people are attending to 
their daily prayers as was their wont in years past. Fathers and 
mothers, if you do not teach the children how to pray, and if you 
do not pray yourselves, there will be unlocked a door and the evil 
influence of the powers of darkness will enter the home. I remember, 
when I was a counselor in the Utah stake of Zion, although there were 
but few cases of trouble between the wife and the husband that ever 
came before the Presidency for decision, in every such case, it de- 
veloped that in that home prayer had been discontinued ; and I plead 
with the people here that they not only pray themselves, but that they 
have their children pray as well, and teach them how to pray. 



102 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



I cut out of the paper yesterday morning, a clipping from a 
Chicago paper. I was delighted to read it, and I am going to read a 
portion of it now to you. Perhaps you did not notice it: 

"Consideration, at the Protestant Episcopal Triennial General 
Conference, of divine healing, and the question of giving it official 
sanction as a part of church work, drew attention to the fact that 
several of the churches in the Chicago diocese already maintain classes 
in faith healing. Our method is that of James, the Anglican layman, 
who conducted meetings of healing in Chicago a few years ago ;" and 
then, brothers and sisters, it goes on and describes what they are 
undertaking to do, and winds up by saying that they were following 
the plan of James — not the Apostle James of old but James, the 
Anglican layman. 

They deny that there is any power of God in the administration. 
I thought to myself : I would that the peoples of the world would begin 
to think more of prayer and follow the teachings of the Master — fol- 
low the plan laid down by James, in the days of the Savior, for he 
says — "Is any sick among you? Let him call for the elders of the 
Church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil, in the 
name of the Lord. And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and 
the Lord shall raise him. up, and if he have committed sins, they shall 
be forgiven him." 

A RECENT EXPERIENCE 

I know as well as I know I live that there is power in prayer. 
I do not know but what it would be proper for me, at this time, to 
call attention to an experience that I had four weeks ago today. 
Sunday afternoon I called at the White House, to call upon the 
President. For days Mrs. Harding had been lying at the point of 
death. The President was in the sick room when I arrived, together 
with Dr. Mayhoe, Dr. Finney, Dr. Harding and some three or four 
other prominent doctors. The attendant announced to the President 
that I had called to see him, and he came out of the sick room into his 
private office adjoining the sick room. He had been watching over 
Mrs. Harding for days and nights past, seeing each day bring her 
nearer to the brink of the grave, and the doctors had just decided 
that nothing would save her but an operation. The question of 
the operation was left to the President for decision. The President 
said : "I have never had, in all my life, a question brought to me for 
decision that I feel so helpless in arriving at." I haven't the time to 
go into the details. Worried as he was, haggard as he was, it seemed 
to me if any word of encouragement could be given to him, it ought 
to have been given. What a wonderful woman Mrs. Harding is, lying 
upon her sick bed for days. When Dr. Finney was leaving the room, 
she gave orders to take him down to the depot in the President's car, 
rather than send for one himself ; and, while the President and I 
were discussing questions affecting legislation, on which he had asked 
me to make a report to him, and just as I was about to leave, the at- 



ELDER REED SMOOT 



103 



tendant brought into the room a beautiful box of roses, stating that 
Mrs. Harding had directed him to bring them to me to deliver to 
Mrs. Smoot. Nobody thought that Mrs. Harding would live through 
the night. The decision as to an operation had to be reached, so the 
President told me, before midnight; and, as I left the room, he came 
with me until we stood at the head of the stairs. I turned to the 
President and said, "President, there is hope yet. I have seen men 
and women raised from a death-bed. I know that there is power, 
Mr. President, in prayer- — the wife can yet be saved. Do not be dis- 
couraged." And I said, "This night a prayer shall go up from my 
home, that God may spare her life, that she will not have to under- 
go an operation." He said to me : "Senator Smoot, I wish I 
knew that. I believe in prayer. I wish I knew that God through 
prayer would heal the sick." There were millions of people praying 
for her, from one end of the land to the other, but as those noted 
physicians sat around the bed, as midnight was approaching, there 
came a change. God had heard the prayers for her and the crisis 
had passed. 

How many cases could we relate, testifying to just such power, 
and I hope and I trust that we will never forget that God rules the 
universe. 

The other day, my attention was called to a wonderful painting, 
the author of which was Tompkins H. Mattson. It was called "The 
First Prayer in Congress." I noticed in that painting that a majority 
of all the members of that first congress that was held in Carpenter 
Hall, Philadelphia, September 5, 1774, were kneeling in prayer, and 
among those who Were kneeling, I noticed George Washington, Pat- 
rick Henry, John Rutledge, Col. Folsom, Payton Randolph, Richard 
Henry Lee, John Jay, Isaac Lowe — some of the most renowned Amer- 
ican citizens that ever lived. 

A WARNING TO VIOLATORS OF THE LAW 

I wish now just in a few words, in closing, for I see the time is 
past, to say that the laws of the land must be obeyed and enforced. I 
want to warn law makers ; I want to warn business men ; I want to 
warn the wealthy of the United States, that they cannot violate the 
law with impunity. Some time in the future, their actions will 
arise to plague them. Men cannot serve liquors of all kinds at their 
dinners — not only in violation of the law on the part of the party that 
sold the liquor to them, but in violation of the law on their own part — ■ 
without, sooner or later, paying the penalty. Violation of the law 
is the first step to anarchy, and don't let us think that the man who 
has no regard for law, no love for the constitution of the United 
States — an outcast in all society — can see the violation of laws, on the 
part of legislators, the wealthy of the land, and not take advantage 
of the same by offering it as an excuse for his actions. So, my 
brothers and sisters, I ask you to be loyal, not only to the constitution, 
but the laws of our land.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



"I am not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ, for it is the 
power of God unto salvation." I know that God lives. I know that 
this is his Church. I know that all he has predicted will come to pass, 
if we are but loyal and true and sustain his work here upon this 
earth. 

God bless you all. Amen. 

The choir, with Miss Dolores Seal, soprano, as soloist, sang, "In- 
flammatus." 

Benediction was pronounced by Elder John V. Bluth, president 
of the North Weber stake of Zion. 

Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock. 



FIRST OVERFLOW MEETING 

An overflow meeting of the Conference was held in the Assembly 
Hall at 10 o'clock, Sunday morning, October 8. Elder Rulon S. 
Wells, of the First Council of Seventy, presided. 

The music and singing were furnished by the Twenty-first ward 
choir, Salt Lake City; Elder Walter A. Wallace, leader; with Elder 
Tracy Y. Cannon at the organ. 

The choir and congregation sang, "High on the mountain top." 

Prayer was offered by Elder Elias A. Smith. 

The choir sang, "Glorious things of thee are spoken, Zion, city 
of our God !" 

ELDER DAVID A. SMITH ; 

(Of the Presiding Bishopric of the Church.) 

Those who have been called upon to speak during this confer- 
ence have dwelt upon subjects which to them seem most important. 
Each man who feels his responsibility is anxious for the cooperation 
and help of the Church members. I sincerely hope that I may be 
assisted by the Spirit of the Lord in delivering to you the message I 
have in my heart. 

The Apostle James counseled us as follows : 

"Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh 
down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither 
shadow of turning. Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, 
that we . should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures. Wherefore, my 
beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to spelak, slow to 
wrath: for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God. Where- 
fore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and' receive 
with meekness the engrafted word which is able to save your souls. But 
be ye doers of the word, arid not hearers only, deceiving your own selves. 
For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man 



ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 105 

\ 

beholding his natural face in a glass: For he beholdeth himself, and 
goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was. 
But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, 
he being not a forgetful bearer, but; a doer of the work, this man shall be 
blessed in his deed. If any man among you seem to be religious, and 
bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is 
vain. Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To 
visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself 
unspotted from the world." 

What a blessing it would be if we could only remember and 
obey this counsel. It is a common thing for one to find grounds for 
criticising others, and how seldom db we make a careful examination 
of our own lives, with a view to correcting our own faults. 

This was forcibly impressed upon me the other day when, upon 
returning to Salt Lake City from the north, where I had been with 
a number of Salt Lake business men, I made the remark in the pres- 
ence of President Grant, that we had covered the distance in very 
fast time ; a time which far exceeded the speed allowed by law. His 
reply was : "How foolish we are. We get up in the morning and pray 
that God will protect us during the day, and then go straightway 
and do things we know to be foolish and dangerous." I answered 
that with a high-powered, heavy car, forty or fifty miles does not 
seem fast. "No," said he, "but if you should hit a telegraph pole you 
would know how fast it is." 

I have been unable to get away from this thought. How many of 
us fail to prove by our life's work that we are doing our part toward 
the protection of our own lives, as well as to protect and elevate those 
who have an equal right with us to live and enjoy happiness. Some- 
times this is only impressed upon us when we, figuratively speaking, 
hit a telegraph pole, or some other object, thus doing injury, not only 
to ourselves but to others. 

I imagine that we have improved very little since the days of 
Nephi, and that perhaps we are living in the day he spoke of, when he 
said, "In that day there shall be many which shall say, eat, drink and 
be merry, for tomorrqw we die, and it shall be well with us ; and 
there shall also be many which shall say, eat, drink and be merry, never- 
theless fear God ; he will justify in committing a little sin. Yea, lie 
a little, take the advantage of one because of his words, dig a pit for 
thy neighbor; there is no harm in this; and do all these things, for 
tomorrow we die ; and if it so be that we are guilty, God will beat us 
with a few stripes and at last we shall be saved in the Kingdom of 
God." 

We have been warned time and time again that God's blessings 
are dependent upon the fulfilment of his law; to receive his promise 
we must comply with the law. For the purpose of helping us to 
understand and prepare more fully to comply with the law, we have 
had given to us certain organizations. 

During this conference considerable has been said concerning the 
work of the Mutual Improvement Association. Brother Lyman ap- 



106 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



pealed especially to the members of the Church to encourage young 
men between the ages of seventeen to twenty-three to become active in 
the Mutual Improvement Association. Dr. Widtsoe spoke on the 
great work being accomplished by our Church school system. These 
organizations are necessary and very helpful, but in my opinion the 
main responsibility for the training of young men in this Church, 
rests upon the Priesthood organizations, which is God's plan, "which 
Priesthood continueth in the Church of God in all generations and is 
without beginning of days or end of years." 

At times man seems to feel that he can improve upon God's plan, 
and in his anxiety to do so may overlook the greater object in his en- 
deavor to see his own work succeed. The auxiliary organizations and 
Church schools are in the Church as helps in government ; stepping- 
stones in the Priesthood, — the final reward is to come to man through 
his Priesthood activities. 

In considering these organizations we must not overlook the 
value and importance of home training, for, after all, it is in the 
tender years that habits are formed that have a great influence in 
directing the lives of God's children. We have the Primary, kinder- 
garten, Religion class and Sunday school, which are given to us for 
the purpose of helping to train children during these tender years, 
and sometimes I wonder if parents are content to leave the training of 
their children wholly with these organizations. The age of twelve 
has been fixed as about the time a young man should be prepared to 
receive the Aaronic Priesthood — the first step in authority in God's 
great work. How wonderful is his great plan, and yet how simple. 

The child when born into the world learns largely from observ- 
ing others. It sees its parents or brothers and sisters do things and 
makes an attempt to imitate them. By untiring effort it learns to' do 
the things it sees them do, and learns to repeat the words they en- 
courage it to speak; thus step by step it grows and develops and be- 
comes less dependent upon them, although their life and actions have 
exerted an influence, and has so impressed the child that this influ- 
ence, whether good or bad, will thereafter have its effect upon the 
child's life. 

As a deacon in the Church, the boy is given his first experience in 
Church government. As the baby learns through observation, the 
deacon learns to do by doing. His duties require that he perform 
outward ordinances, such as passing the Sacrament, visiting the homes 
of the members for the purpose of collecting fast offerings, or to dis- 
tribute substance to the poor. He may go upon errands for the 
bishop, act as usher, and should at all times be made to understand 
that he should have reverence and respect for the House of the 
Lord. 

Think of the effect of this work upon a young man just com- 
mencing his labor in the Priesthood. Think of the strength that comes 
to him in knowing that he is, in a sense, custodian of the Lord's 
properties. Think of the joy that should come to him in assisting to 



ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 



107 



comfort the poor and needy and those in distress. Think what 
might happen in the life of this young man, when passing the Sacra- 
ment he sees a brother or sister partake of the Sacrament, or perhaps 
his own parents, and knows at the time, that those parents are not 
keeping the commandments of God, and are breaking the Word of 
Wisdom. Think of the effect upon a young man, after having seen 
a brother partake of the Sacrament, and then that afternoon or the 
following day to see him smoking a cigar or cigarette or profaning 
the name of the Lord. Do these acts have a tendency to create 
in the life of the boy a spirit of respect and reverence for this ordin- 
ance ? Or do they have a tendency to make them mechanical with 
him, and thus cause him to lose his respect for this ordinance, and 
his interest in the work he should be performing as a servant of the 
Lord? 

Can a young man of this age, the age when his life is being 
molded for good or bad, hear his parents complain of the bishop, 
the president of the stake, or the general authorities of the Church, 
and have the respect for these men he should be taught to have ? Oh, 
how different it would be if all these influences were for good, and 
the purpose of encouraging the young man to greater faithfulness in 
the Church, and to create a greater spirit of reverence and a desire 
to become more active in his labors as an officer in the Church. To 
taste the sweetness of service, under the constant encouragement of 
members of the Church would bring to the young man of this age 
a safeguard that would be everlasting, and would help to prepare 
him for the next step in authority which comes with the ordination 
to the office of teacher. 

Often I have wondered if the members of the Church really 
grasped the importance of this office and the magnitude of its pos- 
sibilities. Many times have I heard men holding the holy Melchizedek 
Priesthood refuse to be burdened in their labors with a young man 
whom they thought was poorly prepared to labor in the Church as 
a teacher. I have heard them say, Of what real use in the teaching 
corps is a young man of fifteen or sixteen? When it has been pos- 
sible to answer these queries, I have referred to the fact that at this 
age Joseph Smith went into the woods to pray, and in answer to his 
prayer, through his faithfulness, received the visitation from the 
Father and the Son. At this age, the late President Joseph F .Smith 
was sent to the Islands of the Sea to preach the gospel. At twelve 
the Savior heard and asked questions of the doctors, and declared 
he must be about his Father's business. 

Have we ever stopped to consider that the mission of the teacher 
is not to preach or to teach the people concerning the principles of 
the gospel, but that his duty is, "to watch over the Church always, 
and be with and strengthen them, and see that there is no iniquity in 
the Church, neither hardness with each other, neither lying, backbiting, 
nor evil speaking, and see that the Church meet together often, and 



108 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



also see that all the members do their duty." This requirement, to 
my mind, fixes the home as the training ground for young men just 
beginning their ministry among the people. Think of the influence up- 
on a young man to know and to be encouraged to feel that his mis- 
sion is to watch over the Church always — not to labor with the out- 
sider, with those who are unfriendly or unsympathetic, but to "watch 
over the Church, and be with and strengthen them, and see that there 
is no iniquity in the Church, neither hardness with each other, neither 
lying, backbiting nor evil speaking." 

Can a young man of the age of fifteen to seventeen years enter 
the homes of members of the Church and there find that the mem- 
bers of those homes are keeping the commandments of God, and are 
complying with this requirement, and go from those homes and en- 
gage in doing the things he knows to be wrong, and which will bring 
reproach upon him, and lessen his influence to do good in the office 
to which he has been called? Think what a wonderful opportunity of 
training and helping to fix indelibly upon the mind of the young man 
God's purposes and promises through the encouragement he may re- 
ceive from members of the Church. And again, think of the dis- 
couragement that may come when he sees that members of .the Church 
are giving very little thought to these matters, and criticize the actions 
of the Church officers in calling boys of this age to this important 
work. If we engage in this we have not hearkened to the words of 
the Apostle James to "lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of 
naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is 
able to save your souls." We are not doers of the word but hearers 
only, deceiving our own selves, and we cause the young man thus dis- 
couraged to look, as it were, in the glass, wherein he sees the pic- 
ture we, in our distorted condition of mind, picture him to be, rather 
than the servant of the living God he was intended to be. . It is 
through this discouragement, I believe, that so many of our young 
men withdraw from Church activity and fail to measure up to the 
requirements of the Priesthood. 

The next step in authority is the office of priest. The young 
man, after having received his training as a deacon and teacher, is re- 
quired, to "Preach, teach, expound, exhort, and baptize, and ad- 
minister the sacrament, and visit the house of each member, and 
exhort them to pray vocally and in secret, and attend to all family 
duties." Thus as his experience increases, his opportunity for ser- 
vice increases, his labors being with the members of the Church 
where, .through their example and help he can grow and develop into 
a useful instrument in the hands of the Lord to deliver his word to 
those who are unfriendly and know not of the plan of salvation. What 
a wonderful opportunity is a here given to the Church in laying the 
foundation for the future usefulness of God's children. You can see 
that the responsibility of carrying on this work, and of making God's 
plan serve its purpose, rests .mainly upon the members of the Church : 



ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 



109 



that the ward bishopric is the guiding hand for them, standing as the 
presidency of the Lesser Priesthood. 

Do we as ^parents, as members of the Church, fully realize the 
responsibility that rests upon us? Are we teaching our boys and girls 
in their youth to respect the principles of the gospel, and to labor 
diligently and faithfully in 'the office and calling whereunto they have 
been called, where they can learn the joy of service and feel the love 
that comes through a united effort in the service of the Lord ? Are 
we paying our tithes and our offerings ? Are we providing the way 
by which our children can learn in their youth to obey the command- 
ment of the Lord, that we remember him with our tithes and our 
offerings? I often recall the words of the Psalmist: "The earth is 
the Lord's, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell 
therein. For he hath founded it upon the seas, and established it 
upon the floods. Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord, or who 
shall stand in his holy place? He that hath clean hands, and a pure 
heart, who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceit- 
fully. He shall receive the blessing from the Lord, and righteousness 
from the God of his salvation." 

I pray, my brethren and sisters, that in humility, we will take 
advantage of the opportunity God has given to us for the training of 
young men who are called to positions in the Lesser Priesthood, and 
feel fully the responsibility that rests upon us in carrying on this 
great work. May God give us strength and determination to do our 
part, I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 

(Of the First Council of Seventy) 

Th,is great gathering of people is a lesson to me in faith. You 
have come up to conference to give your time in listening to the prin- 
ciples of life and salvation. From all parts of the state and all the 
West, you congregate twice a year on this Temple Block wrjth the 
spirit of worship in your hearts- What a wonderful thing it is to go 
to the "holy altar of God and pay your devotions." In ancient days, 
the Jews went to their temples to worship God, and in the days of 
Christ, his followers came together to give unto each other the "light 
of ihe Spirit." Today this Temple Block has become a gathering 
place for the worship of the Most High God. To me the place is very 
sacred. Here we have the temple, which is the symbol of eternal life, 
for therein many hundreds of God's children are being directed to eter- 
nal truth- It took many years to build the temple. In fact, it was 
erected by a people who were compelled to toil and learn life's mean- 
ing by the anguish of their souls. The people who created that holy 
temple did so by work and faith, and they knew full well that work 
with faith in Christ Jesus would accomplish anything. That build- 
ing is the symbol of strength ; it is the expression of the ideals of a 



110 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



great people who are building and working with their eyes lifted to 
God. It should always inspire us to great ideals. 

Then think of the tabernacle. Do you know something of its his- 
tory? It was built before the railroad came to our doors. It, too, 
is an expression of great ideals and hard work. You assemble there 
to hear God's word ; you go there with the spirit of reverence and 
worship. 

The tabernacle is indicative of the strength of character and re- 
ligious dreams of the Latter-day Saints. The only building of its 
style in the world, stands out as unique in the history of architecture. 
While its massiveness suggests a people strong in spirit, conviction, 
and purpose, its lines indicate a splendid adaptation of scientific prin- 
ciples in architecture. The tabernacle is a perfect ellipse, with focuses, 
which partly account for the good acoustics of the building. A plain, 
egg-shaped building, "studded with heavy entrance doors all the way 
'round" there is no attempt at ornamentation of any kind, and yet 
the building is wonderful both on the exterior as well as in the inte- 
rior, and is an example of the utilizing of the resources of the people 
for the purpose of elevating their intellectual and religious idealism. 
The tabernacle impresses one as a great, immense, irresistible force, 
"humanly .superhuman," an expression of sovereign intelligence. It is 
the acme of usefulness as a building; it is wonderfully artistic. It is 
as the great Ibsen has declared of all art, "an illuminjation of life." 

The pioneers who erected the Tabernacle were a high minded 
people. From the innermost depths of their souls, they gave their 
children a fine idealism of life and its meaning which they hold sacred 
today. Their ideals found expression in venerable and lofty institutions, 
and they contributed to the religious and intellectual, the ethical and 
civic life of the age. They madeihomes and turned the arid waste of 
the far West into beautiful private gardens- They built institutions 
of learning, and did much to improve the prevailing order of their 
day. They built houses of worship and fostered the drama and art, and 
out of that time of vitality and isocjial virility, they constructed their 
great tabernacle, a building that commands the respect of all people 
who see it. 

The tabernacle is one of the largest auditoriums in the world, and 
seats from six to eight thousand people. It is 250 feet long by 150 
feet wide, and 80 feet in height- The self-supporting roof rests upon 
pillars or buttresses of red sandstone, which are from ten to twelve 
feet apart in the entire, circumference of the building. These but- 
tresses support good wooden arches, which span 150 feet. The arches 
are of a lattice truss construction, and are held together with great 
wooden pegs and bindings of cowhide. On the interior one is im- 
pressed with the great vaulted ceiling, and "the vastness of the place 
grows upon one and inspires one with mingled feeling of solemnity and 
admiration." 

The immense roof, which is the principal portion of the build- 



ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 



111 



ing, rests upon forty-four piers of cut sandstone masonry, each nine 
feet from the outside to the inside of the building, three feet in thick- 
ness, and twenty feet in height. On each s)ide of the building are nine 
pillars in a straight line- From these an arch of forty-eight feet is 
sprung. Thirteen arches spring at each end from thirteen piers, which 
stand on a circle. The height from the floor to the ceiling, in the 
center of the building, is 70 feet. Between the ceiling and the roof, 
there is a space of nine feet. The roof is framed of lattice-arched 
bents, twelve feet from center to center, each arch converging and 
meeting at the highest given pdint of the main outside bents, where 
they are securely fastened with cowhide and wooden pegs. On the 
north and south sides are thirty spaces between the piers, where the 
windows, containing over 2,500 lights of glass, are placed. In twelve 
of the spaces are the doors opening outward, which affords ready 
egress from the building. There are four small doors in the west end 
of the building, and two large ones in the east end, leading to the 
gallery. 

Above the piers are over one million feet of timber; in the floor, 
80,000 feet; in the joists, 100,000 feet; in the sleepers, 30,000 feet; in 
the doors, stand, benches, and other equipment, 290,000 feet ; in the ag- 
gregate 1,500,000 feet. The roof was originally covered with nearly 
400,000 shingles, but these were replaced in 1900 by a metallic cover- 
ing weighing many tons. 

Something now about the great organ. 

In the early sixties, Mr. Joseph Ridges was selected by Presi- 
dent Brigham Young to build an organ in the tabernacle, and the idea 
was endorsed by other citizens, among whom were David O. Calder, 
Dariiel H. Wells, George A. Smith, Alexander C. Pyper, and Dr. J. 
M. Benedict. After submitting preliminary drafts to President Young 
and his counselors, Mr- Ridges began making arrangements for the 
construction of the instrument, and was assisted by his associates, 
Shure Olsen, Niels Johnson, Henry Taylor, Frank Woods, and others. 
Meetings were held with these men almost daily, and the reports of 
each man's work were listened to. While one was collecting various 
specimens of wood from the canyons of Utah, another was devising 
good tools to work the wood with, while still a third man was experi- 
menting in making glue. So the preliminary work went on. Specimens 
of wood were sent by the colonists from all over Utah, and it was 
finally decided that the best wood was found in the hills around Par- 
owan and in Pine Valley, more than 300 miles south of Salt 'Lake 
City. It was a fine grain of the white pine variety, free from knots 
and without much pitch or gum. For the large pipes, it was especially 
well adapted. 

The larger pipes, some of which measure thirty-two feet, required 
thousands of feet of timber, all of which was sawed on the ground 
where the trees were cut down. Over the long, lonely roads trudged 
the oxen day by day, hauling the heavy logs to Salt Lake City. At 



112 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



times there were as many as twenty large wagons, each with three 
yoke of oxen drawing its load. The roads were rough and dusty, 
and many streams had to be bridged, that the wagons could pass over 
without difficulty. In crossing one stream in southern Utah the logs 
were let down over the bank with ropes and the oxen driven some 
miles to find a ford, where they crossed and followed on down the 
bank to pick up the wagons and loads again. The timber was fjinally 
landed in Salt Lake City. Another important necessity for making 
the pipes was glue. This was made of hundreds of cattle hides as well 
as buffalo skins, by boiling the strips in large pots over fires. 

The organ was begun in January, 1866. About one hundred men 
were employed constantly in its construction, and it was dedicated in 
October, 1867. 

Just outside this building — the Assembly Hall — is the Gull Mon- 
ument. It is one of the most beautiful specimens of sculpture ever ex- 
ecuted in America- The sculptor was Mahonri Young, a grandson 
of President Brigham Young. Critics of art have pronounced it a dis- 
tinct contribution to the world's sculpture. It commemorates the sav- 
ing of the wheat fields in the spring of 1848 by the gulls. Have you 
ever carefully studied the bronze tablets on the four sides of the base ? 
I call your attention to; the one on the south in particular. It shows 
how the woman, the mother remaining true to her work, and expressing 
her instincts is looking up to the sky with sublime faith on her face. 
The gulls are wending their way over the fields from the Great Salt 
Lake, and are to pounce on the crickets, destroy them, and thus save 
the crops. The mother's look is one of sublime trust that all will be 
well. She is the mother, the pioneer mother, who over unknown trails 
has passed on to the new land with the joy of God's Spirit in her soul. 
The monument is the embodiment of an ideal, the family life of early- 
day Utah. 

So, my brethren and sisters, this Temple Block is worthy of your 
coming- It is the symbol of God's holy place where he may be wor- 
shiped in spirit and in truth. To these grounds we must all bring 
the spirit of worship ; and then, as we leave them, to go our way in 
life, we will have a spirit of life ever-lasting; a soul full of light and 
happiness. To me the Temple Block is a symbol of beauty, tight, 
and life everlasting. 

A solo, "Within the sacred house," was sung by Walter A. Wallace. 

ELDER CHARLES H. HART 

{Of the First Council of Seventy) 

Among the number of the inspiring songs to which we have list- 
ened during this Conference was one sung yesterday, a favorite of the 
late Theodore Roosevelt : 

"How firm a foundation, ye Saints of the Lord, 
f , : Is laid for your faith in his excellent word." 



ELDER CHARLES H. HART 



113 



I thought how firm a foundation for personal and national righteous- 
ness is being laid during this Conference. I think it is well that the 
brethren have said what they have of the great charter of American 
liberty, the Constitution of the United States. It is no new theme in 
the Church. Elder Orson Pratt referred to it as "established as 
firmly as the rock of ages." Elder Parley P. Pratt said: "The 
longer I live and the more acquainted I am with men and things, the 
more I realize that the instrument called the Constitution of American 
liberty was certainly dictated by the spirit of wisdom, by the spirit of 
unparalleled liberty and by a spirit of political utility." The Prophet 
Joseph Smith said that it was "a glorious standard." He compared 
it to a great tree whose branches were broad enough to shelter people 
of all classes ; "the 'Mormons' as well as Presbyterians and every other 
denomination have equal rights to partake of the fruits of this great 
tree of our national liberty." In view of the emphasis laid by President 
Grant and other speakers upon the Constitution of the United States, 
it will be timely to read the words iof one Judge Marshall, of Wiscon- 
sin, in a modern decision ; he wrote : 

"At no period has appreciation of the great work of the fathers bee'^i 
more important than now [referring, of course, to the framers of the 
Constitution]. We need to sit anew at their feet — revive knowledge that 
the result was wrought by a body of men, representatives of the great 
seats of learning of the English speaking race of two hemispheres, and other- 
wise men of broad -experience, many of whom had been students o'f all 
federal governments of all prior ages in preparation for the special task — as 
the historian declared, 'the goodliest fellowship of lawgivers whereof this 
world has record' — a body dominated by specialists, inspired by ennobling 
love fon their fellow men, and the thought that they wrought, not for 
their age alone, but for the ages to come, and, so, sought to avoid the 
infirmities of previous systems of government by the people, by carefully 
providing that no change in letter or spirit should occur except in a 
particular and most deliberate and conservative way." 

The document has been amended by us in recent years in just such 
way giving us recently the great principle of national prohibition in 
this country, whfich it is the duty of every good citizen, particularly 
every Latter-day Saint, to support — support by giving information to 
the officers of those engaged in illicitly distilling liquor, and as com- 
plaining witnesses against those who are engaged in any such illegal 
business. 

I am sure that the great Lincoln would have been pleased to have 
heard the proceedings of this Conference in support of law and order, 
for he made a plea a little stronger, perhaps, than anyone else has, in 
fact, the strongest I have seen in literature upon this subject. President 
Lincoln said: 

"Let every American, every lover of Liberty, every well-wisher of his 
posterity, swear by the blood' of the revolution never to violate in the least 
particular the laws of the country, and never to tolerate either violation by 
others. Let reverence for the laws be preached by every American mother 
to the lisping babe that prattles on her lap; left it be: taught in schools,

be written in primers, in spelling- books and in almanacs; let it be preached 
from the pulpits" — and so say; the First Presidency of the Church today — 
"let it be! preached from the pulpits, proclaimed in legislative halls, and en- 
forced in the courts of justice. And in short, let it become the political 
religion of the nation and let the poor, the grave and the gay, of all sexes 
and tongues, and colors and conditions, sacrifice unceasingly upon its altars." 

One of the jurists of the United States has pictured the glory that 
would come to us if every citizen would do his duty. This is the lan- 
guage of Justice Brewer : 

"Picture the glory of this Republic if in each individual life were fully 
disclosed respect for law, taste for justice, regard for the rights of others, 
remembrance of the poor and afflicted, encouragement of education, the 
helping hand to everything that is true, beautiful and 'good." 

Speaking of the jurists of the United States, I think we of Utah 
may well be proud of the fact that one of our citizens was recently 
selected to fill a place on that great tribunal, the greatest that the 
world has ever known, and I am sure that the friends of Utah also will 
feel proud that Utah has been given special honor in that one so con- 
servative and so learned in the law has been selected from Utah for a 
place upon that august tribunal. 

The beauty of this gospel of ours is that not only is ijt the plan 
of life and salvation to individuals but also to nations. It is not the 
part of patriotism to ignore entirely the dangers there may be to our 
nation. Great statesmen have not been indifferent to the perils to the 
life of our nation. Webster, for instance, on this subject said : 

"If in our case the representative system ultimately fails, popular gov- 
ernment must be pronounced impossible. No combination of circumstances 
more favorable to the experiment can ever be expected to occur. ; The last 
hopes of mankind, therefore, rest with us, and if it should be proclaimed 
that our example had becoime an argument against the experiment, the knell 
of popular liberty would be sounded throughout the earth." 

We are living in a day when there are many advocates of things 
affecting adversely the well-being of this country of ours. The trouble 
in this country is the lack of faith and confidence. We hear pessimis- 
tic remarks as to the future of our country. During the war, one of the 
greatest of the war poems, so estimated, was in reference to the de- 
Btructibility of nations. Time will not permit the reading now of 
this poem, written by Marshall South, entitled "Progress," giving the 
condition of nations that have passed away- He takes first the his- 
tory of the glory of the Assyrian cities, and their boast, "Behold our 
progress and enlightenment ; we are the people. We shall surely stand." 
— -That was their boast respecting themselves. Then there is a de- 
scription of those proud Assyrian cities, the destruction of which is 
predicted in holy writ. Then the same thing in reference to Egypt: 
"Behold our progress and enlightenment! We are the people! We 
shall surely stand. And speaking thus they passed." The same 
with Rome and with modern nations, and thus boasting they fell to 



ELDER CHARLES H. HART 



115 



decay. We sang the other day in Conference of the time when the 
"proud monarch's costliest diadem will be counted but dross and re- 
fuse." Many of those present here have lived to see this come to pass. 

The question is, what can we do to safeguard our nation? Look 
at current literature as to the condition of our nation and the world. 
Prof. G. Stanley Hall's article in the October number of the Century 
Magazine is entitled "Salvaging Civilization." Doesn't that have an 
awful import — salvaging civilization? In support of his article he 
reviews a number of writings as to conditions affecting our coun- 
try. For instance he reviews an article entitled, "The World in Re- 
volt," by Gustav LeBon. Another article by McDougall, who takes 
the place of Prof. Munsterberg at Harvard, discusses, "Is America Safe 
for Democracy ?" He feels called upon to sound a warning note. Then: 
there is Prof. Edward A. Ross whose subject is, "The Old World in 
the New." Then there is "Democracy and the Human Education" by 
Ireland; "Dynastic America," by Klein; "The Modernizing of the 
Orient," by Clayton S- Cooper; "The Awakening of Asia," by Hynd- 
man; "The Rising Tide of Color," (the negro problem in this coun- 
try) by Lothrop Stoddard; "The Next War," by Will Irwin, in which 
he depicts the horrors of another war if it should ever come — how two 
big airships could wipe out a city like Berlin in a few hours; that is 
the picture shown by him.; "Microbes and Men," by R. T. Morris; 
"The Simian World," by another author, emphasizing "man's origin! 
from the apes ;" and the dramatist's conception of Deity is awful. 
I would not like to publish the slander ! There is a note of deep pes- 
imism throughout all this literature. Prof. G. Stanley Hall thinks 
that the churches cannot cure the evils; of course he speaks of churches 
as he knows them. He may not know the saving power of so-called 
"Mormonism." It is not a gpod picture that is presented by the writers 
of the world. In a recent speech Secretary Davis spoke of a million 
of babies taken annually from their mothers' breasts in death almost 
before they can open their eyes in this world ; of a half million of crip- 
ples and defectives ; of the million children who have to labor, and do not 
have an advantageous childhood, but are pressed down by adverse 
circumstances, and the millions of school children of our land who are 
getting an education that will fit only about one in ten for the par- 
ticular labors which then will follow in life. 

The gospel is not only reasonable but it is practicable- You can 
test every question agitating the nations of the world by these saving 
principles of "Mormonism." 

A few simple verses in conclusion. I commend the thought to 
those who teach the millions in our school rooms and to those who else- 
where are seeking the development of character: 

We are building every day, 
In a good or efvil way, 
And th.e structure, as it grows, 
Will our inmost self disclose, 



116 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Till in every arch and line 
All our faults and failings shine; 
It may grow a castle grand, 
Or a wreck upon the sand. 

Do you ask what building this 
That can show both pain and bliss, 
That can be both dark and fair? 
Lo, its iname is Character! 

Build it well, whate'er you do; 
Build it straight, and strong and true ; 
Build it clean, and high, and broad; 
Build it for the eyei of God. 

And that is what we Latter-day Saints are endeavoring to do i:i 
our auxiliaries, and in the quorums of the Priesthood, — the building 
of character; and may the Lord help us to do so, that, in the splendid 
character of men and women that can be developed, there will be a sav- 
ing grace for commonwealths, for states, and also for nations, is my 
prayer in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER JOHN WELLS 

(Of the Presiding Bishopric of the Church) 

I have enjoyed the spirit of this conference and the counsel and 
admonitions which have been given. I feel the spirit of this great 
gathering of Latter-day Saints who have come from all parts of the 
country and have met in general conference to be instructed and edi- 
fied in our most holy faith. 

The great World War, as well as being responsible for terrible 
destruction of human life and property, has absorbed the religious in- 
fluence of the world. Some of the nations will never fully recover 
or regain their former prestige or social condition. It is the mission 
of the Latter-day Saints and the purpose! of the gospel to make the 
world better. The only remedy for the conditions now prevailing in 
the world, is the acceptance and application of the gospel of Jesus 
Christ in the lives of the people of the world. Such principles as 
love, sympathy, kindness, mutual helpfulness and respect for the lives 
of others, all make for the betterment of mankind, and all are incor- 
porated 'in the gospel. 

We have heard it said very often of late that the world needs 
to be stabilized. Instead of stability there are still rumors of wars, and 
the nations of Europe are in a ferment. Suffering, poverty, and ad- 
verse financial conditions have rendered it almost impossible for the 
nations to settle down to their new conditions of life, as a result of 
the war. Even in our own nation there has been brought about con- 
flicting interests between capital and labor, which have resulted in 
strikes, all of which might be overcome, if an unselfish attitude were 
taken by those engaged in these conflicts. We may look forward to 
more friction of this character, but the Lord has said : "Stand ye in 



ELDER JOHN WELLS 



117 



holy places and be not moved." We should not be tossed to and fro 
with every wind of doctrine, whether it be social, political, financial 
or otherwise, because the Lord has revealed to us his purposes, and we 
should train our hearts to be willing t0 ! carry them out. 

We sincerely believe that in the early Christian era, the prophet, 
known as John the Revelator, foresaw the restoration of the gospel. 
He also saw an angel fly through the midst of heaven, having the ever- 
lasting gospel, and after that he saw a time when a voice would be 
heard, saying, "Come out of her, oh, ye my people, that ye be not par- 
takers of her sins, and receive any of her plagues." The Lord has 
called us out of the world and brought us into the tops of the moun- 
tains, where, if we will follow his commandments, we may be pre- 
served while destruction and strife prevail in the earth. 

Under our present conditions of living, we are subject to many of 
the conditions that prevail in, the world, such as panics, labor strikes, 
lockouts, and scarcity of employment, etc. As a people we should 
learn that human beings need one another, and that mutual helpful- 
ness, loving sympathy, kindness and a cooperative spirit should prevail 
among us. Some of us may be affected by politics ; others by business 
readjustments ; others by abnormal local conditions. Many have been 
affected by the strikes and lockouts, and the results which follow 
such terrible methods of adjusting disputes and differences. 

As I ponder over these things I am reminded of the great Taber- 
nacle organ. Consider a moment its many intricacies of construction, 
the tireless attention to detail that this instrument calls for to keep it in 
tune, and to operate it so that it may bring forth the wonderful and 
inspiring music that we hear during conference. Unless it is handled 
by a master mechanic, and its keyboard manipulated by a master mind, 
it may get out of tune, and it needs those master minds to' keep it in 
tune, ,so that its harmonies may thrill our souls. Sb it is with Latter- 
day Saints. We come to this great conference, some of us worn with 
the anxieties of life: we are out of tune a little, and then when we 
hear the voices, the admonitions and advice of the servants of the Lord, 
holding the holy Priesthood, our anxieties seem to lessen, we feel in 
accord with our fellowmen ; the .strife of the world appears to us in 
a new aspect, something to be overcome and not feared ; we are in 
a receptive mood to receive the counsels of our brethren and leaders, 
and to be prepared more fully to carry on this great latter-day work. 
And so we should return home willing and anxious to impart to 
those who did not have the privilege of attending this conference, not 
only the words and counsel, but the spirit of the great gathering, and 
thus create harmony, good-feeling, and fellowship in the communities 
from whjich we come. 

The home is the great stabilizing influence of the Church, and 
of the nation. It is the mission of the Latter-day Saints to develop 
the highest type of family life. If we fail in our home life ; if we fail 
to teach and train our children in the' principles of the gospel, and to 



118 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



love their f ellowman ; if we fail to impress upon them the word of 
God, then we have not done our duty. And as the home fails, so will 
the community fail. 

Let me advise the Latter-day Saints to observe strictly the laws 
of the gospel, particularly to keep the Sabbath day holy arid not to 
allow modern life with its automobiles and pleasure resorts to swerve 
us from what we know to be right and proper in the observance of 
the Lord's day. Many of the great inventions of these latter days 
are destroying respect for law, respect for the Sabbath day, respect 
for religion and for constituted authority. Let us use all these modern 
inventions in a proper way, but 'do not let us use the Sabbath day for 
a day of pleasure, or recreation, or devote it entirely to the pleasures 
of life. We should carry out strictly the word of the Lord as found 
in the 59th Section of the book of Doctrine and Covenants : 

"And that thou mayest more fully keep thyself unspotted from the world, . 
thou shalt g,o to the house of prayer and offer lip thy sacraments upon my holy 
day; for verily this is a day appointed unto you to rest from your labors, and 
to pay thy devotions unto the Most High ; nevertheless thy vows shall be offered 
up in righteousness on all days and at all times ; but remember that on this the 
Lord's day, thou shalt offer thine oblations and thy sacraments unto the Most 
High, confessing thy sins unto thy brethren, arid before the Lord. And on this 
day thou shalt do none other thing, only let thy food be prepared with single- 
ness of heart that thy fasting may be perfect, or, in other words, that thy joy- 
may be full." 

May we so live that the Spirit of the Lord may be our constant 
companion ; that it may guide us constantly ; that this Spirit may develop 
in our hearts a love of the truth and a love! of the work of God and 
love of our fellowmen, that we may develop sympathy for the mis- 
fortunes of humanity, and the weaknesses of our fellowmen, and 
strive by example to be a light to the world, that, "seeing our good: 
works the world may glorify our Father which is in heaven." Amen- 

ELDER RULON S. WELLS 

{Of the First Council of the Seventy) 

I was deeply impressed by the remarks of Elder John A. Widtsoe 
in the opening meeting of yesterday, in the great Tabernacle, who spoke 
of education as a means for overcoming the evils of the present day — 
the utter lack of regard for law and order — the spirit of violence and 
contempt for law on the one hand, and the stiffnecked selfishness and 
greed on the other. I am converted to the fact, and always have been, 
that education (and when I say education I mean that full rounded-out 
education which contemplates the development of all our faculties) 
would be a complete remedy for all such evils. We are the children of 
God and this world is a great school. Shakespeare said : "All the 
world is a stage, and all the men and women are but actors in it." But 
you will allow me to paraphrase this expression and say : "All the 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS 



119 



world is a school, and all the men and women are but students in it." 
All other institutions of learning such as our public schools, our sem- 
inaries and academies, our colleges and universities, including also our 
Church schools are supplemental auxiliaries to this great school which 
has enrolled upon its record every living human being, and in times 
that are past, every soul that ever breathed the breath of life. By far 
the greater part of our education is received outside of these auxiliary 
institutions, and I hope that no one will think that I underestimate their 
value. On the contrary I regard them highly important and the teach- 
ers and professors who have specialized for their respective departments 
are great benefactors of the human race and are engaged in a noble 
calling- 

Among these educators men have risen to high distinction, and 
the world is rightly proud of them, but in this great school God is our 
teacher and with him none can compare. "There is a spirit in man : and 
the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding" (Job 32 :8). 
And whatever enlightenment or understanding may have come to man be 
sure it came from the Great Fountain of all truth — from the Almighty 
that giveth him understanding; and this is true whether men admit it 
or not. Some there are who arrogate all the credit to themselves and 
their work — to perspiration not inspiration. Surely the inspiration of 
the Lord will come to those who work and study and endeavor with all 
their might to know the truth, and not to the indolent. 

I often think of that Greek philosopher, who had been studiously 
searching for the law of speqific, gravity, and who while bathing 
in a pool noticed how much lighter the body was in the water than out 
of it, and forgetting that he was naked rushed out into the street cry- 
ing "Eureka, Eureka, I have found ilj! I have found it." The in- 
spiration of the Almighty had given him an understanding. So has it 
always been with every great discovery or invention, and this view does 
not and should not in any degree detract from the honor which the 
world is glad to give to those whom God has used as instruments in 
bringing truth to light. "And the Spirit giveth light to every man that 
cometh into the world." (Doc. and Cov. 84:46.) This clearly re- 
lates to every department of learning whether secular or religious and 
to all men and women whether believers or not. It is universal. Thus 
God is teaching by his Spirit all the nations of the earth, but there have 
also been many false teachers and many have preferred thair teach- 
ings, for "men love darkness rather than light because their deeds are 
evil." 

Even in the study of the secular branches of education we need 
the inspiration of the Almighty. In the study of history, geography, 
mathematics and the sciences, also in our physical education which in- 
volves the law of health and the proper care of the body but above 
all in our spiritual education, which relates to the things of God and 
which includes within it the two former branches for after all with 
God all things are first spiritual. 

It is the mind and will of God that all men shall receive the high- 



120 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



est education and enlightenment, but there is "no royal road to 1 learn- 
ing, and those who will receive diplomas in the school of God must 
take the course outlined in its curriculum which provides that men 
shall not only know the truth, but also do it. And this truth is the 
gospel of Jesus Christ which is the "power of God unto Salvation ;" 
and salvation means education ; for, as the Prophet Joseph Smith has 
told us, "men are saved no faster than they obtain knowledge," and "the 
glory of God is intelligence." The first steps are faith in God and re- 
pentance from sin to be followed by baptism by immersion for the re- 
mission of sin performed by a duly accredited agent of God endowed 
with "power from on high," and all this that men may be cleansed from 
sin through the atoning blood of Jesus Christ, whose death and res- 
urrection is so beautifully symbolized in this sacred ordinance- And 
after having thus been cleansed from sin, and not before that, they 
may receive the Gift of the Holy Ghost — the Spirit of truth whose 
special duty is to lead us into all truth — the great educator under 
whose tuition we may receive the highest degrees — become real Doctors 
of Divinity. But we may only obtain this special endowment, which 
comes to us as a gift from God, the gift of the Holy Ghost, through 
the cleansing process of the gospel, as I have just indicated, and it may 
only be retained just as long as we keep ourselves "clean and unspotted 
from the sins of the world," for his Spirit will not dwell in an unclean 
tabernacle. 

Do we appreciate this wonderful gift and the necessity of retaining 
it — the constant companionship of the Holy Spirit to be our tutor, our 
teacher, our educator? To what heights may we not ascend or into 
what depths may we not delve in our pursuit of knowledge under such 
guidance? "Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered 
into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them 
that love him. But God hath revealed unto us by his Spirit ; for the 
Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God. For what 
man knoweth the things of a man, save by the ^spirit of man which 
is in him? Even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit 
of God" (1 Cor. 2:9-11). 

Education obtained under such divine instruction would surely 
be a remedy for the evils of the day. The gospel of Jesus Chirst 5s a 
gospel of repentance from sin and is therefore a panacea for every 
evil. Its teachings would do away with selfishness and greed, with 
violence and lawlessness, with strikes and their cause, with immor- 
ality and debauchery, with robbery and murder, and the whole cate- 
gory of crime- 

Education means development and growth. We are the children 
of God, and have inherited from him all of his divine attributes. The 
difference between him and us is this : he is educated, we are not, but 
having his attributes we are susceptible to receiving an education which 
means the development in us of his divine attributes. The injunction: 
"Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father in heaven is perfect," 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS 



121 



js reasonable and within the limit of possibility, which would not be 
the case if we had not inherited all his attributes. . These attributes 
though perfect in him are very imperfect in us, and are capable of 
being perverted or distorted and counterfeited and thus changed from 
virtue into vice. The development of the divine attributes and the re- 
jection of the distorted and counterfeited onqs is only another phase 
of repentance. 

For example : Economy is a godlike attribute and in the economy 
of God there is no waste. What an abundant supply of water there is 
in the creation of this earth ; three-fourths of its entire surface is cov- 
ered with this element. It comes trickling down the mountain sides, 
springing forth from the canyons into the mountain streams, and thence 
into the rivers. It is often diverted onto arid lands, and causes them to 
bring forth rich harvests ; and sometimes harnessed, lighting our cities 
with electric rays, setting in motion the machinery of the world, and 
again finding its way into the river beds and on out into the great 
ocean where it is caught up into the clouds through evaporation and 
wafted by the winds back into the mountains to begin anew its useful 
course. And yet, not a single drop is wasted. In the economy of God 
there is no waste. Yet how liberally and abundantly it is used. Con- 
trast this divine attribute with the devil's counterfeit — stinginess. Some 
people think they are economical when in reality they are merely 
stingy. How I despise a stingy man. Generosity is a noble attribute. 
The Lord loves a liberal giver. Its counterfeit is wastefulness and 
prodigality. Acquisitiveness is the power of accumulating and acquiring 
wealth. See what the Lord hath acquired, the earth is his and the ful- 
ness thereof, and the devil has his counterfeit of this noble attribute, 
we call it avarice ; it is one of the great causes of human suffering, it is 
the love of money, the root of all evil, thus we might continue the 
long list and show how praise becomes flattery, wisdom pedantry, pride, 
vanity; admiration is changed to envy and self esteem, a proper re- 
gard for one's self, becomes egotism. How despicable ! The big I and 
the little you. Always talking about oneself, and only interested 5n 
others when they are talking about him. The greatest of all attributes 
is love, the biggest thing in the world, the all including attribute ; the 
love of God and our fellow man is the fulfilment of the law and 
the prophets. This is truly alone the complete remedy for all the 
evils of our day. And then, think of the devil's counterfeit, lust, 
licentiousness. The holier the divine attribute the more contemptible 
Its counterfeit. 

Everything that is good and useful someone tries to imitate or 
counterfeit. Gur government issues currency in various denominations, 
and they pass for legal tender, but some devil counterfeits them and 
palms them off upon the public. Gold and silver coins are issued from 
the mints, and are worth their face value, but the devil or some of his 
imps will take a baser metal and gild it over with gold and pass it off 
as genuine. 



122 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Pure religion and undefiled, before God the Father, embraces 
within it everything that is good and holy; but hypocrisy, the 
devil's counterfeit, embraces within it all that is vile and evil, in- 
cluding these distortions and counterfeits. Don't despise the pure 
gold of religion simply because the devil has made a counterfeit 
of it in hypocrisy. 

Thus the Lord is endeavoring to educate us in his great 
school, for his Spirit is striving with all men, and through the 
inspiration of the Almighty a great flood of light and under- 
standing is coming into the world, but if you are ambitious and 
desire a full rounded-out education and particularly in the deep 
things of God, remember this can only be secured by obedience to 
his gospel through which we secure and may retain the constant 
companionship of his Holy Spirit, the gift of the Holy Ghost, a life 
scholarship in the great School of God. Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem, "As the dew from heaven distilling." 
Benediction was pronounced by Elder G. M. Barnes. 



FIRST OUTDOOR OVERFLOW MEETING 

An outdoor overflow meeting was held at the Bureau of In- 
formation, 10 a. m., Sunday, October 8, 1922. Elder Rey L. Pratt, 
President of the Mexican mission, presided. 

The congregation sang, "We thank thee, O God, for a prophet." 

Prayer was offered by Elder William O. Crowther, president of 
the San Luis stake of Zion. 

The congregation sang, "Come let us anew our journey pursue." 

ELDER WINSLOW F. SMITH 

(President of the Northern States Mission) 

In his first epistle to the Corinthians, Paul addressed a particular 
message to the men of Corinth, in these words: 

"Ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, 
not many mighty, not many noble, are called; 

"But God hath chosen, the foolish things of the world to confound the 
wise; and God hath chosen the weak things ,of the world to confound the 
things which are mighty; 

"And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God 
chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are : 

"That no flesh should glory in his presence." 

The great word of the Lord at all times has been given to the 
world through humble men. It has not been the policy of our Father 
to go into the schools of the learned, into the palaces of the mighty, 



ELDER WIN SLOW F. SMITH 



123 



to pick men to do his work, but at all times he has chosen men who 
were humble, who were unknown, and he has magnified them and 
made them mighty in the work which he had for them. We can look 
back into Old Testament times, and almost without exception the men 
who were called were humble, obscure men. We can come down 
to the day of the Savior, and we find that "though he were a Son, yet 
learned he obedience by the things which he suffered ; and being made 
perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that 
obey him." The Savior of the world, the Redeemer of mankind, 
the Son of the living God, came here and lived humbly, as a man 
among men. He moved with the humble ; he lived with them ; he ate 
with them ; he slept with them ; he was one of them ; and until he began 
to come into prominence, he was unknown to the mighty of his day. 
And when the hour had come for him to commence his work in pub- 
lic and he needed helpers, he did not go into the higher schools nor 
into the palaces of the mighty, but he went down to the seashore and 
chose humble fisher folk, men of no importance in the eyes of the 
world. He said unto them, "Follow me, and I will make you fishers 
of men ;" and in that they did follow him, he did make them the 
fishers of men, and he magnified them that they grew to be most 
marvelous servants of the Lord. And while the men of their day 
who were mighty in the political, and influential in the commercial 
and the educational world, have in a large degree been forgotten, 
these humble fisher folk and tradesmen that the Lord called and 
magnified live in the hearts and in the lives of millions of men, and 
their names will go down through all time as the men who carried on 
the great work inaugurated by the Lord Jesus Christ. 

Now, coming on further down in the history of the world and 
considering the great latter-day work, we find that when the time had 
arrived, when God was ready to do his great work, he did not go 
into the schools of the learned, into the palaces of the mighty, but 
took an unknown backwoods boy in the state of New York. That 
boy was the man he wanted. His spirit was pure; his life had been 
such that he qualified for this great work. So the Lord chose Joseph 
Smith and appeared to him with his Son, Jesus Christ, and they told 
Joseph that if he would be loyal and true and live the life that he 
should live, he would see the day that the gospel would again be on 
the earth, with all its powers, its gifts, its graces, and its blessings. 

So this boy went forth ; and in time there came to him more rev- 
elation, more light, more knowledge ; and ultimately it was made known 
to him that he was the chosen vessel to carry on the work of the Lord. 
When he was qualified, and had received this heavenly knowledge, he 
called to himself humble men (for his own position in life was not 
such as would attract the attention of the important and the learned) 
and in full faith, Joseph Smith, and the men who joined him and 
believed in his message commenced the work of organizing in its 
fulness, in its completeness, yes, in its entirety, the Church of Christ. 

We are all familiar with the work that they did : how that in this 



124 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Christian land of ours, which God had prepared for the day of the 
coming of his work where there were hundreds of churches, with many 
honest souls who were ready to receive the light in its fulness, these 
young men went forth declaring, not a new gospel, not something 
that the world had never heard, but the old fashioned gospel, the 
same principles that existed in the primitive church, the same officers 
to administer in the ordinances of the gospel, the same godly virtues 
that men must follow in order to work out their salvation. The world 
was astonished to hear this unknown boy declaring these same prin- 
ciples and the same things that they had always heard ; but the world 
was more astonished, more completely upset when this same boy, this 
man called to open the dispensation of the fulness of times, this prophet 
of God declared to them that they did not have the power of the 
Priesthood of the living God. In the Church of Jesus Christ there 
must be divine power. These churches were doing good, they were 
teaching moral living and uprightness, yet in their organization, in 
their ordinance work, in their teaching of the gospel of Jesus Christ, 
there was not the power of the Priesthood of the living God. 

Boldly did he declare this great message, fearlessly did he and 
his associates go forth teaching and preaching, and the result was 
that the world saw that there was something astir that they had not 
dreamed of. The world saw that in the work of this young man and 
his associates there was power, and they marveled at it. And that 
power was there, my brethren and sisters, because the Priesthood of 
the living God was again upon the earth. Joseph and his associates, 
humble men that they were, rose to a place that today their names are 
known throughout the entire civilized world, and the work that they 
commenced, the gospel of Jesus Christ, taught through the organ- 
ization known as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 
has grown steadily. Despite the fact that it has met bitter oppo- 
sition, terrific opposition, in fact, at the hands of the mighty, at the 
hands of the learned, it has grown and developed until today it is 
filling the whole earth. 

I have in my pocket here a statement made by the late Charles 
Ellis, a non-member of the Church who lectured a number of years 
ago in Salt Lake. He asks this question, "Why has 'Mormonism' 
been so much misunderstood?" And then he proceeds to answer his 
own question in these words : "Simply because the evangelical 
churches saw in its success their own downfall, and they dared not 
let their own followers know what 'Mormonism' really is, lest they 
should embrace it." This is a truth, an absolute fact, my brethren 
and sisters. The thinking world recognizes in this thing called "Mor- 
monism" a power with which it is not able to cope, recognizes that 
despite a hundred years of bitter persecution that little stone, cut out 
of the mountain without hands, has rolled forth and is rolling forth 
slowly filling the whole earth. They see this, and when we turn back 
to that passage of scripture that I quoted to you, we see, as members 



ELDER WIN SLOW F. SMITH

of the Church, that God has made the weak strong, has made the 
humble mighty, has made the unlearned so wonderful that the light 
of their teachings has gone into all the world. 

When we study present-day religion, when we study the creeds 
and the teachings and the doctrines of the present-day churches of 
the world, we find all through them the effects of "Mormonism." 
They are changing their doctrines. They are teaching something new. 
They have cast aside many of the old things that they had one hun- 
dred years ago, and in their place are substituting the glorious prin- 
ciples of life and salvation. We find them teaching tithing, we find 
them teaching a personal God, we find them teaching the brotherhood 
of man, we find them teaching in a small degree the Word of Wis- 
dom. We find things first advanced in this day and age by Joseph 
Smith, the unknown, unschooled boy prophet, whom God made mighty 
for the work, gradually being accepted by the world ; we find the 
churches of the world teaching his doctrine. 

And so, my brothers, you men who hold the Priesthood especially, 
I say unto you that upon you, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints, rests the grave responsibility of doing the work of the Lord. 
We have the Priesthood, and if we are living to magnify our calling, 
we have the right to officiate in the name of God, and if we are doing 
our duty and are faithful and true and our faith is sufficiently strong, 
those blessings and signs which the Lord Jesus Christ said should fol- 
low the believer will be made manifest in our behalf; we will heal the 
sick ; we will cast out devils ; because of these things ; these signs, are 
to follow them that believe. While we admire the man who strives 
for education, and while we rejoice to see our brethren climb up in 
the world of affairs, more potent, more powerful, more wonderful 
than all that can be achieved by them is this Priesthood of Almighty 
God, which is yours and is mine, if we live worthily and magnify our 
callings. 

How wonderful is the gospel of Jesus Christ! How gloriously 
is its message being heralded to all the world ! What a splendid body 
of men and women are the missionaries you send out into the field ! 
Go where you will, search this great world of ours from one end to 
the other, and, brethren, I tell you, you cannot find their like, for in 
their souls they have the Spirit of the living God; they have obeyed 
the command of the Lord; they have done his will; they have kept 
his word. And according to the promise of the Lord Jesus Christ, 
wherein he said, "If any man will do his will, he shall know of the 
doctrine, whether it be of God or whether I speak of myself," they 
have done his will, they are doing his will, they are keeping his com- 
mandments, and they know of the doctrine, that it is of God, and they 
go forth fearlessly. In their humility they are mighty. They are 
men of God and women of God, and the work that they are doing will 
fill the whole world. God has said that this work shall triumph. 

You or I may fall aside, we may lose our faith, we may fail to 
sustain and support the men God calls to preside over us, but the work 



126 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



of the Lord will go on and we, if we fail to do those things, will lose. 
It has been here a hundred years now. The work is going forward. 
The purpose of the gospel of Jesus Christ is to prepare men to re- 
ceive from our heavenly Father the great glories that he has for them. 
"This is my work and my glory," said the Lord, "to bring to pass 
the immortality and the eternal life of man." And I tell you, my 
brethren and sisters, that these words are true, that they are being 
fulfilled, and that the men and women of the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints who are loyal and who are true will reap this 
blessing. The Priesthood of the living God is here. It is on the 
earth. Its effects are being felt, and our eternal Father is at the 
helm. Men may fight against the Church of Christ ; men may say 
all manner of evil things against this people; men may kill us, if it 
goes so far, but at the helm there stands the living God, and this work, 
the gospel of Jesus Christ, taught by the Church of Jesus Christ, is 
here to prepare the world for Jesus' coming, for truly he is coming 
to reign as King of kings and Lord of lords. And we, my brethren 
and sisters, will have our place in the kingdom of our God, if we 
are true. May he help us to be true, I humbly pray in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER ANDREW JENSON 

(Assistant Church Historian) 

My brethren and sisters and friends: I am afraid my voice can 
not reach the people who are standing way off in front of the As- 
sembly Hall. I have never posed very much as an outdoor speaker. 
I prefer to speak under a roof. But nevertheless, I desire, on this oc- 
casion, to be true to my appointment and endeavor to say a few words, 
trusting that most of you can hear what I have to say. 

I am representing the historical department of the Church, and I 
have for many years had a kind of a mission of my own. In this con- 
nection I have to a certain extent been alone in my class — not but what 
others have also worked faithfully in the same line, but it has been 
my privilege for many years to devote nearly all my time, and the best 
of my mental faculties, to writing, compiling and gathering together 
material for a somewhat complete history of the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints for the Nineteenth Century. It is expected that 
younger historians will write the histories of later years. 

I find, my brethren and sisters, that the very first thing which 
the Lord said to his Church, after it was organized on the 6th of 
April, 1830, was that a record should be kept among the members. 
Several years later Joseph Smith (in an epistle that he wrote from 
Nauvoo) stated something like this, "Whatsoever you record on earth, 
shall be recorded in heaven, and whatsoever you do not record On 
earth, shall not be recorded in heaven." The Prophet, in writing this, 



ELDER ANDREW JENSON 



127 



alluded to baptism for the dead, but the rule holds good, if I judge 
right, in other matters as well. 

Now, in perusing the Bible, I find that the very first thing, the 
very first line in the sacred volume, is history : It says : "In the be- 
ginning God created the heavens and the earth." The first paragraph 
in the Book of Mormon is also history, as it reads : "I, Nephi, having 
been born of goodly parents : therefore I was taught somewhat in all 
the learning of my father." The very first passage in the Pearl of 
Great Price is of a similar nature. We find these words : "The words 
of God, which he spake unto Moses, at a time when Moses was caught 
up into an exceeding high mountain. And he saw God face to face, 
and he talked with him, and the glory of God was upon Moses ; there- 
fore Moses could endure his presence." Continuing on, the narrative 
explains how the Lord wanted to reveal to Moses the early history of 
this world. The Lord said that there were many other worlds, but 
that Moses could not comprehend the extent of God's creation, and 
therefore he proceeded to tell Moses about the beginning of this world 
— the world "upon which thou standest." 

I allude to these things to show you the importance of records. 
I am convinced that no one historian, nor four or five historians, can 
possibly do justice to everything that ought to be written on Church 
history at the present time. Nor can the stake clerks, the ward clerks, 
the clerks of the different quorums of priesthood, nor the clerks of 
the different auxiliary organizations, do all the recording necessary. 
You must help do it. All of you must assist in this great work whereby 
the memory of men and women of prominence and of integrity can 
be perpetuated, and their history be handed down, so that their glo- 
rious examples may shine for the benefit of those who follow through 
future generations. 

We do not as a people desire to boast of what we have done, or 
are going to do, in fact, we are not boasting at all when we occasionally 
allude to what the Latter-day Saints have done and what they intend 
to do. Nor do we wish our friends to imagine that we are egotistic 
when we allude to what we think the future has in store for us. But 
we are proud, as historians, to occasionally refer to the fact that the 
Latter-day Saints have already done something worthy of them. The 
gospel has already been preached by us in the different nations of the 
earth to an extent that gives us* great satisfaction. True, we have not 
covered the whole earth yet with our preaching, though our elders 
have visited almost every land and clime. But there are many coun- 
tries where the people would not receive us as missionaries, where 
the governments have banished us the moment we have shown our 
faces to testify. of the restored gospel. Consequently, the majority of 
the inhabitants of these countries cannot be held responsible, as they 
have not heard enough of the true gospel of Jesus Christ either to save 
them or damn them. But in such countries where we have had access, 
we have diligently preached the gospel to the best of our ability and 
are just a little bit pleased with our records of the past in this regard. 



128 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



We are somewhat satisfied with the missionary work we have done 
in the past and with what we are doing now. However, we have had 
more missions in years gone by than we have at the present time; 
that is to say that several missions were established at an early day 
which are not in existence now. We are thankful to our heavenly 
Father for the work enjoined upon us as Latter-day Saints, namely, 
to preach the gospel to every nation, kindred, tongue and people, to 
gather in the elect from the four quarters of the earth and to organ- 
ize them into stakes of Zion and into wards and settlements by locat- 
ing them in the land which God has designed for his Saints to gather to. 

We have done something also by way of colonizing, and that 
is another thing* with which we are somewhat pleased. We com- 
menced our first colonization way down in Jackson County, Missouri, 
as early as 1831, and we are anxious that a true and faithful record 
should be made of what we did there to be handed dowin to future 
generations. We desire our children to know what the Latter-day 
Saints were doing at the beginning on the borders of the United 
States (on the western edge of the country) as pioneers and colonizers. 
Among other things we established a printing office 120 miles further 
west than any other printing office in the United States, as early 
as 1832. We founded a settlement near the banks of the Missouri 
River which would undoubtedly have grown to great dimensions, had 
we been permitted to continue our efforts, and instead of a Kansas 
City we might perhaps have built a strong "Mormon" headquarters in 
Jackson county. Perhaps we would have called it Zion, the New Jeru- 
salem, or the capital of the world, from which the law should go 
forth in the Lord's own due time to all the nations of the earth. Jack- 
son county, Missouri, is the one locality about which the Lord said, 
"Zion shall not be moved out of its place," and while we are now 
here in these mountains and Salt Lake City contains our central stakes 
at the present time, Jackson county, Missouri, will nevertheless be a 
capital, a headquarters, the place where a great temple shall be built 
unto which Christ shall come in his own due time. 

We are proud, also that we did not become discouraged because 
we were driven from our first location. For after the mobbers had 
robbed us of our homes in Jackson county, we had courage enough to 
cross the Missouri river and try again, and thus we became success- 
ful colonizers also in Clay county, Missouri, in 1833-1836. 

Then speaking of what we did a little later, we are quite satisfied 
with our achievements in the upper counties of Missouri. We can 
truthfully say that in going into an open prairie country, where there 
were only four families living at the time, in the course of three years 
we had between twelve and fifteen thousand Latter-day Saints, occupy- 
ing Caldwell, Daviess, Ray and other neighboring counties. We turned 
the naked prairie into fertile and thickly populated farming districts. 
We founded the city of Far West which, at the time of its prosperity, 
contained something like two thousand inhabitants. We also com- 
menced the city of Adam-ondi-Ahman, and purchased the town of 



ELDER ANDREW JEN SON 



129 



De Witt, in Carroll county, besides building quite a number of vil- 
lages in that part of the country. I will venture to say that we are a 
little proud of our pioneer achievements in the state of Missouri. 

We are also a little proud when we think of Kirtland, Ohio, to 
which place Joseph Smith, the Prophet, moved early in 1831. He found 
there only a few families, but in the course of a few years the Saints 
had two thousand souls gathered in Kirtland, and built their first 
temple, which still stands. 

We are even more satisfied with what we did as pioneers and 
colonizers in Illinois. When the Saints, who had been driven out of 
Missouri, robbed and plundered by mobs, came to the little village of 
Commerce, they found a few inhabitants, who were struggling in vain 
to build up a town on the banks of the Mississippi river, but had only 
succeeded in building up a graveyard on the side of the hill, although 
they had plenty of means wherewith to establish a settlement in the 
western country. The Saints, who followed these people feel pleased 
and satisfied when they consider the labor that was done there by them 
through the blessings of the Lord. 

And let me not forget to add that in all these instances it was not 
only our Christian endeavor and our union, that caused success to 
come to us, but we sincerely believe that God was on our side. We 
were a God-fearing people ; we prayed to the Lord then as we pray 
new invoking his blessings upon our labors, and it seems to me that 
the Lord took special delight to prove to the world that it mattered but 
little whether his Saints were located in a desolate or a good country, 
for he would take care of them anywhere ; he could temper the elements 
for their sake and make them prosperous. And thus it came to pass 
that right there in Hancock county, Illinois, where the rich people 
who preceded us as settlers had not been able to build up a village, the 
Saints, in the course of five or six years, built up the beautiful city 
of Nauvoo, with a-million-dollar temple in the center of it; it was 
at the time of its prosperity the largest city in the state of Illinois. By 
what I have said, it will be seen that we had considerable experience as 
pioneers before we were driven westward and before we came to the 
Rocky Mountains. 

We are very well satisfied also with the history of the Mormon 
Battalion. The Saints who were exiled from Nauvoo, in 1846, had 
expected to reach the Rocky Mountains that year, but did not succeed 
in carrying out their plans because a call came from Washington, D. C, 
for five hundred of the "Mormon" men to go into the war with 
Mexico; and it seemed that this was a great sacrifice and a number 
of our co-religionists could not understand why the Saints should re- 
spond to a call to fight for a government which had neglected to de- 
fend them against mobs; but good counsel prevailed, and the bat- 
talion marched west ; and among many other things connected with 
the history of the Church with which we are pleased is the achieve- 
ments of the Mormon Battalion, and the way these "Mormon" boys 



130 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



behaved themselves as Christians and soldiers. The effect which 
their good example had upon the civilization of California at an early 
date is most remarkable. It is a chapter of Church history that we like 
to write, and while it is already partly written, it will be written in 
more detail hereafter. 

When we speak of Winter Quarters, located near the present site 
of the city of Omaha, we are just a little pleased to know that Winter 
Quarters was the first Anglo-Saxon settlement in what is now the 
State of Nebraska. We were successful there, as is well known, in 
building up a Christian community in an Indian country. We had a 
Church organization there with twenty-two wards, in which for a 
couple of years (1846-1848) we had great success, comparatively 
speaking; and, as I say, it was the first Anglo-Saxon civilization in 
that part of the United States. 

A majority of the members of the Mormon Battalion, marching 
westward, reached California in due course of time, but others became 
worn out with fatigue on the long journey. There were sick men 
among them, besides women and children, who were considered unable 
to cross the great, sandy American deserts, through what is now 
Ntw Mexico and Arizona and the eastern parts of California; hence, 
some of the Battalion boys were sent northward and camped during 
the winter of 1846-1847 on the Arkansas river, at a place called 
Pueblo; and we are just a little pleased to think that that little Anglo- 
Saxon settlement, formed by the sick detachment of the Mormon 
Battalion, and a small company of Saints from the State of Mississippi, 
etc., was the first Anglo-Saxon settlement in what is now the State of 
Colorado. 

We are satisfied also with what we did after our arrival in the 
valley of the Great Salt Lake, the next year, 1847, we being the 
founders of this beautiful city, the like of which there is none in the 
United States, nor in all the world. Some of us have circumnavigated 
the globe, and I wish to say this to you : Go where you may in the 
different lands and climes on earth, and you will not find a city just 
like our own beloved Salt Lake City, with its broad streets, its majestic 
temple, its unique tabernacle, its attractive assembly hall and many 
other things that adorn our city, which are not to be found elsewhere 
in the whole world. And we are more than pleased to think that our 
city was founded by a God-fearing people, men and women who put 
their trust in God, and who sought first the kingdom of God and his 
righteousness, relying' upon the promise that other things should be 
added unto them. This city, the most beautiful city in the world, 
and a number of other cities and towns existing in this Rocky Moun- 
tain region, testify of temporal blessings that have come to a people 
who have faith in God. 

After we had been in this central valley a while, we extended our 
settlements north, south, east, and west. We are quite pleased to 
think that when Thomas S. Smith, of Farmington, was called, in 1855, 



ELDER ANDREW J EN SON 



131 



to go north and locate a settlement among the Indians near the Salmon 
river, he and his company of pioneers became the first Anglo-Saxon 
settlers in what is now the State of Idaho. We are pleased with the 
labors of Apostle Orson Hyde, in the year 1853, when he and others 
were called to settle Fort Supply, near Green river, which was the 
first Anglo-Saxon settlement in wihat is now the state of Wyoming. 
We are quite pleased also to think that we were the first settlers in 
Nevada. Our boys, who had served in the Mormon Battalion, in re- 
turning from California to join their families in the valley of the 
Great Salt Lake, found that beautiful valley in which Carson City, 
the capital of Nevada, now stands. Enoch Rees and others were 
called by President Brigham Young to settle there as "Mormon'' pio- 
neers, and afterwards Orson Hyde organized a stake of Zion which 
flourished for a while in that part of our country. 

It also gives us considerable satisfaction to think that in the 
year 1846, some of the Saints who resided in or near the cities of 
New York and Boston, and others as far east as Maine, decided to 
embark on a long voyage in order to reach the new gathering place of 
the Saints, instead of crossing the great continent of America. They 
chartered the ship Brooklyn, set sail from New York, doubled Cape 
Horn, touched the Hawaiian Islands, and arrived in the Bay of San 
Francisco one year before President Young and his .pioneers arrived 
in the Great Salt Lake Valley. We are just a little proud to think 
that these same Latter-day Saints, about 230 strong, almost imme- 
diately after their arrival in California changed a little, insignificant 
Spanish village, called Yerba Buena, into an Anglo-Saxon town, the 
present San Francisco. We are also a little pleased to know that the 
beautiful San Joaquin Valley, in California, was first settled by 
Latter-day Saints. Some of those who arrived in California on 
the Brooklyn were farmers who came from the rural districts of New 
England, and as they could not see any opportunity for successful 
farming on that sandy stretch on which San Francisco is built, they 
naturally looked into the interior of the country, and there found the 
place where the two rivers, the San Joaquin and the Stanislaus, join 
together, and here they established Port Hope, the first Anglo-Saxon 
settlement in that beautiful valley of California, which now contains 
seven of the most flourishing counties of that state. 

I could continue my historical narrative but the time is limited, 
because there are other speakers. I refer to these incidents of his- 
tory, my brethren and sisters, to inspire you with courage, and to im- 
press upon your minds the fact that it is not alone what we intend 
to do — though we believe we have a far greater future than we have 
had a past — but that we have already done certain things in the past 
which should encourage us and our children. When our children learn 
what their parents and grandparents have done, they should naturally 
place more confidence and reliance on the Lord, and believe that he 
will sustain them and bless them and give them success, as he has 



132 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



given their parents before them success ; for we are destined to fill 
up America with settlements of the Saints and stakes of Zion. North 
and South America is the land of Zion itself, and when we have 
President Pratt presiding over this open-air meeting today, we must 
not forget that he is also presiding over a mission that is perhaps des- 
tined to become one of the greatest and most important missions of 
the Church. The Mexican mission, when it flourishes, will be able to 
produce an element that can fulfil every prediction we have in the 
Book of Mormon concerning the Lamanites. We may perhaps be 
forced to acknowledge that our nomadic Indians in the United States 
have disappointed us to a certain extent; for they have not embraced 
the gospel in such numbers as we had expected, and some of those 
who did embrace it, after our missionaries had spent the best part of 
dieir lives among them, did not remain faithful. But there are mil- 
lions and millions of another class of Lamanites, more civilized, in the 
South, and we hope the time will come when they will embrace the 
gospel in large numbers, and thus be able to fulfil everything con- 
tained in the Book of Mormon by way of prediction concerning that 
race. And not only do we expect the Mexican mission to become most 
successful, but we also expect in the near future to preach the gospel 
in Russia, in the Balkan peninsula, in Persia, India, and all over the 
world. Nationalities which formerly closed their doors against us 
will undoubtedly, sometime in the future, allow us to enter their coun- 
tries and declare to the people, as we have done for these many years 
in the United States and in other countries, that God indeed has 
spoken from heaven in these last days and has raised up a great Anglo- 
Saxon prophet to restore the true gospel of Jesus Christ to the earth 
once more. The name of that prophet shall yet be known by millions 
throughout the world. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, we would like you to understand 
that you belong to the greatest gospel dispensation that has ever been 
commenced upon the face of the earth; every other dispensation of 
God's Providence has come to an end, but in this particular instance, 
when God restored the Priesthood in our day, it was understood that 
it should remain upon the earth forevermore. I believe sincerely that 
the time will never come when historians shall write the history of 
the Latter-day Saints as a people who once flourished on the earth, 
but are no more, for we shall remain for ever, and out of the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints will eventually come forth the 
Kingdom of God, which shall govern the whole world in righteous- 
ness. Let us hope for a great future ; let us hope for better times than 
those we now have. Let. us hope that men may become better Christ- 
ians than they are now or have been of late years. Let us hope for 
the time to come when we Latter-day Saints may be more faithful 
than we have been in the past. Yet after all, our greatest success will 
come when Christ shall reign as King of kings and Lord of lords. In 
the meantime, we must try to the best of our ability to extend the 
borders of Zion, build stakes where there are no stakes now ; and 



ELDER ANDREW J EN SON 



133 



then look forward to the time when Christ shall personally acknowledge 
us as his people. Then comes the glorious time of which we think 
when we sing, "Praise to the man who communed with Jehovah," and 
when "millions shall know Brother Joseph again." 

And now, by way of conclusion, my brethren and sisters, let me 
allude once again to what I sa'd in the beginning of my remarks ; 
Keep your own records, you heads of families ; do not rely altogether 
upon anything that we historians may do. You may rely upon us 10 
a certain extent, but not altogether, because you are too numerous. We 
cannot reach every individual, and yet every faithful man and woman 
in the Church has a history that is worth writing and is worthy to be 
handed down to future generations, for the benefit of thousands who 
should profit by their experience. And so my instructions, my ad- 
vice, my pleadings with you are to the effect that you will not over- 
look this fact, that record-keeping is a matter of the greatest import- 
ance, and that you should keep your ow|n records. All members of the 
Church should know when they were baptized, when they were con- 
firmed, when they were ordained to the Priesthood, etc. We have a 
way of tracing the Priesthood held by every man in the Church back 
to Peter, James and John, but unless you help us in this matter by 
giving us your personal record we may not be able to reach you. Again 
I say, make your own individual records ; find out who ordained you, 
who baptized you, who baptized your children, etc., and then, if you 
find it necessary, come to the Historian's Office, and we will try to 
connect you up with the past, so that every man who bears the holy 
Priesthood, and every man or woman who has a membership in the 
Church, will be able to prove by written documents that they are 
members, that they have been baptized and blessed by "one having di- 
vine authority," and that they have been ordained by those who held 
the Priesthood before them. If you will observe this word of counsel, 
you shall rejoice at some future day. Let us all feel interested in be- 
queathing to our children truth, true history, facts that cannot be 
successfully contradicted. God bless you. Amen. 

ELDER REY L. PRATT 

Our next speaker will be Elder Joseph F. Smith, who has lately 
returned from a mission to the Hawaiian Islands. He is a grandson 
of our late beloved President Joseph F. Smith, and a son of the late 
Elder Hyrum M. Smith, of the Council of the Twelve. 

ELDER JOSEPH F. SMITH 

As I look out over this congregation this morning and see men 
who are older than I, who are wiser than I, who are richer in intelli- 
gence than I am, the place which I hold at this time takes upon it 
an awful responsibility, and I would solicit your faith and your in- 



134 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



terest for the time that I occupy this position, that what I say may 
be fruitful, at least in some hearts. 

Brother Jenson has told you that we are a little satisfied with 
some of the achievements of the early people of the Church. We are 
satisfied, we are proud to think that our forebears have done the work 
they have done : but, brethren and sisters, it is not enough to be sat- 
isfied with what has been done. The question, in my mind, that 
confronts us, is, Shall our children be satisfied with the things we 
are doing now? Are we pushing forward the Kingdom of God here 
upon the earth as the Lord would have us do it? Are we doing our 
work successfully, so that our children may, in time to come, say that 
they are satisfied, that they are pleased with the work that we are doing 
now ? 

We are doing a great missionary work throughout the world. As 
has be:n announced, I have recently returned from Hawaii, where a 
remarkable missionary work is being carried on. In Honolulu they 
are building a new chapel. The Saints are donating their time to the 
building of that chapel. They are spending no money except for 
actual material, and the work is being given ; and I have seen men 
night after night after they are through with their daily voca- 
tion, turn out to that building and haul concrete until half-past twelve 
and one o'clock in the morning. Now, those men would not do it 
for wages. You could not hire men to work like that for money. It 
is the same spirit working upon them that worked upon their fore- 
fathers ; it is the same spirit that brought the pioneers across the 
plains that is having those Hawaiian brethren working hour after 
hour building that chapel, that they can have a place to meet that will 
be a credit to the Latter-day Saints, ■ that they can have a place in 
which to meet that they will not be ashamed of. 

But in my mind the place where there is the need of the greatest 
missionary work in the world is Salt Lake City. We send missionaries 
out into the world, and they do remarkable Work, but there is great 
need for missionary work right here in Zion, right where we live. 
How many of us can say that our community is benefited by our 
being "Mormons" and our living in it? How many of us can say our 
city is being helped because we are living up to the doctrines of the 
gospel? If we are living that kind of life, then indeed we are ful- 
filling our mission upon the earth. 

I think that our young people particularly have need to look to 
the gospel. I speak so because I am one of the young people of the 
Church. In many instances I feel that our young people are losing 
their sense of relative value. They are losing sense of the big things 
in life. We need to know the gospel. "The glory of God is intelli- 
gence,'' and we cannot obey the gospel intelligently unless we know 
what the gospel is and what its laws are. And we have them. Occa- 
sionally I have heard people complain and wonder why we do not 
have more revelation, why the Lord is not continuing his revelation. 
Goodness, gracious, how can he give us more until we understand 



ELDER JOSEPH F. SMITH, III 



135 



what he has already given? Our scripture is full, and how many of 
us take the time to read it intelligently? How many of us take the 
time to go to our Father in heaven and ask him to help us to under- 
stand his word? Because the things of God are understood by the 
Spirit of God, and we cannot understand his word, simple and plain 
as it is, unless we have his Spirit to be with us. That is the reason the 
world has gone astray. They have the Bible, but they have lost the 
interpretation that the Lord meant for it. They have not been willing 
to take God at his own word. Christ spent his ministry here teaching 
people, explaining the gospel, and it was only a very few hundred 
years after that when men met together to put their own interpretation 
upon the scriptures, and as a result the scriptures among learned men 
of the world has fallen into disrepute. They have rejected the Bible 
as a result of the great and false interpretations that have been put 
upon it. They have not been able to strip it of the false interpretations, 
and see and understand it as it is. 

Now, brethren and sisters, I want to bear you my testimony to 
the truth of the gospel of Christ. I feel in every fibre of my being 
that it is the power of God unto salvation. It is the thing that will 
save us, every one, individually, if we will put into our daily lives the 
practice of the laws and ordinances of the gospel. It is here for us, 
and it will be our fault if we do not make the best of it. Young peo- 
ple, understand the gospel ; attend to your meetings. Sometimes when 
I get out among our young people and they do not seem to see things 
just as I see them, I feel as if I could almost suffocate if I could not 
get them to see. There is much about the gospel that I do not un- 
derstand, and I do not ever hope to understand it all. If I did, I 
would hope to be perfect some day — which I do not. I expect to be 
able to progress throughout all my existence ; but there is enough' — 
the testimony in me is strong enough — to make me feel that when I 
run across something I do not understand, that through my faith- 
fulness there will come a time when 1 can understand it. 

It would be presumptuous for me to talk longer when there are 
men better able to talk than I am. I want to bear my testimony that 
this is the true gospel of Christ, and that the salvation of the world 
will be brought about through our taking upon ourselves the responsi- 
bility of preaching the gospel. Three years ago Brother Levi Edgar 
Young spoke in conference and made this statement, which I remem- 
ber well, "There can be no solution to our economic, social, or political 
problems until the world accepts the Christ." And it is true, breth- 
ren and sisters, and the faster we get in and understand the gospel, 
sisters, the faster will the world accept the Christ, the sooner will the 
the faster we go out and do missionary work among our brethren and 
world be prepared for Christ's coming. 

May the Lord bless us to help us to understand his work, to be 
faithful sons and daughters, I ask in the name of Je=' ,c Christ. Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ELDER JUNIUS F. WELLS 

{Assistant Church Historian) 

The last time I had the pleasure of speaking at an outdoor meet- 
ing was in London, in Hyde Park, a year ago last June. I went up 
there to look for a congregation of Latter-day Saints, as I supposed 
there might be an outdoor meeting. I found near the Marble Arch, in 
the northern part of the park, several congregations : one of Catholics, 
one of Lutherans, one of Free Thinkers, some Socialists. They were 
all holding forth, far enough apart from one another, not to confuse 
one another in their services. I looked for some time before I found, 
off at one side, a small number who were singing, "O, my Father." 
And then I knew that I was in the right direction for our own congre- 
gation. I went up to them, and found a young man had just stepped 
forward to speak as the hymn closed. His name is Andre Anastasiou, 
a born Russian, who had been converted to the gospel four or five 
years before. He had become a very zealous and active member of 
the Church ; holding the Priesthood, he was filled with an ambition to 
proclaim the truth, ultimately, to his own countrymen. He was a 
student of law in King's College, London. He had learned the Eng- 
lish language, to speak it quite fluently. I listened to him with in- 
terest as he was speaking. Presently three or four fellows in the 
congregation, who had come there on purpose to nag the "Mormons," 
began to interrupt him. I had not let it be known that I was of that 
faith. I stood with the rest of the small congregation ; I had a 
Panama hat on and kept it on, and so was not recognized. When those 
fellows got to interrupting too much, I stepped forward and pointed to 
them and held up my hand to my ear (I only hear with two-fifths of 
one ear), and I said to them: "Be still; I want to hear what this 
man has to say." That caused them to be still, and they listened, and 
Elder Anastasiou completed his discourse. He delivered a very won- 
derful message, with a fine testimony. 

As he was nearing the end, I drew nearer to him and told him 
that I was Elder Wells ; that I had come from Liverpool, and would 
follow him. So, presently, he quit. The congregation commenced to 
move, just as the back part of this congregation is moving a little now, 
and so, as soon as I stepped forward and took his place, I called out 
in a loud voice, "I was born in Salt Lake City." You should have 
seen how the people turned and drew about me again. I was at once 
a curiosity. Of the Catholic congregation, a large part came over, 
and from the Lutheran congregation, and some of the others; so, 
presently, we had a large — certainly the largest — congregation as- 
sembled there on that Sunday morning; not so large, however, as I 
see before me now. 

It is a great pleasure, my brethren and sisters, to go out in the 
world and meet the congregations of unbelievers, to deliver to man- 
kind, irrespective of their faiths, whatever they may be or have been 



ELDER JUNIUS F. WELLS

in the past, our message ; for we have a message to deliver to our 
fellow creatures. We are called upon by the sublime authority, the 
highest of all, God himself, to declare to his children that he lives, 
that he is, that he has spoken from the heavens ; and deliver to his 
children a message that has been committed to the Latter-day Saints. 
Holding the Priesthood, with the authority to speak in the name of 
God, we have to proclaim the principles of the gospel of life and sal- 
vation, and to call all men to repentance of their sins, that they may 
come into the brotherhood of the Church of Jesus Christ. We de- 
clare to those who listen to our message and give heed to it, that if 
they will follow the counsel and instruction we are sent forth to give 
them, they shall come to a like testimony and knowledge of the truth 
of our message. We have the courage to do this and dare challenge 
mankind to put our testimony to the test. We say to every man what 
Peter of old said : "Repent, and be baptized every one of you, in the 
name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive 
the gift of the Holy Ghost; for the promise is unto you and to your 
children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our 
God shall call." That is our proclamation to all the world, to every 
nation and kindred and tongue and people. Whosoever sets himself up 
to proclaim any other gospel than this, we challenge to a proof of his 
divine authority ; and of his right to call upon any of his fellow 
creatures to repent, in the expectation that he shall come to a knowl- 
edge and the certain testimony that he is accepted of God, in the con- 
gregation and brotherhood of the Saints, and is approved of our 
Father in heaven. So we say, my brethren and sisters, that it is a 
delight to go forth in the world and proclaim this glorious message; 
because we may and can and do so without fear. 

I feel to rejoice with all my heart in the sight that is before me; 
td think that the great tabernacle cannot hold the multitude of Latter- 
day Saints assembled at this conference. In addition to those in there, 
the Assembly Hall is crowded, and here on the outside is a congre- 
gation that would fill it pretty well, listening to the servants of God 
bear their testimony. 

I remember when the Bowery stood just north of here. I remem- 
ber when the old adobe tabernacle stood there in the southwest corner 
of this block. There was a bowery at the north of that. I remember 
when the first stones were laid for the new tabernacle, and have seen 
it and the temple in process of building. I have played upon the walls 
of the temple all my early life, and remember when they were not 
above the foundation. I think I have said my prayers on nearly 
every step, as the building was raised to the top — on those circu- 
lar steps in the corners ; for this was my playground ; I was born across 
the road from here. I have known the men who have officiated in 
this Church, personally, intimately, and have been closely associated 
with them all my life. I bear testimony that they were men of God. I 
knew Brigham Young, have sat on his lap, called him "Uncle Brig- 



138 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ham," and was treated by him almost as one of his own children. I 
knew his counselors, Heber C. Kimball, and George A. Smith, and 
those of the twelve apostles who have administered here. I did not 
know Parley P. Pratt, the grandfather of the man who is presiding 
at this meeting, but I knew his father, Helaman, and himself — three 
generations of faithful missionaries, declaring the gospel that I am 
proclaiming to you now. 

Do you think the world realizes how strong we Latter-day Saints 
are today? Do you think you could portray to a congregation in Hyde 
Park, London, the truth, and have them realize what I am looking 
upon in this assembly? Not at all. They think that "Utah City" is 
some sort of a place out here in the Rocky Mountains, surrounded by 
a high wall, into which we gather a few of those poor girls from 
Great Britain and make plural wives of them. The ignorance of the 
world concerning the Latter-day Saints, in view of the fact of the 
marvelous progress that is being made in the multifarious means of 
communication, is something that is dense indeed. The prophet who 
saw a time when "darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness 
the people" must have been looking upon people of the present day 
world, out in London for instance, the greatest city on earth, where 
gross darkness concerning the Church, concerning this people and 
the work of God, concerning the character of God himself, is dense 
as the darkness of Egypt. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, I do not wish to prolong my re- 
marks. I Wish to close with a testimony to you that the work that we 
Latter-day Saints are engaged in is the truth ; that it is God-given ; 
that it has been preserved by his providence, by his loving care ; that 
it is of far more consequence to him than it can be to any one of 
us ; and that every little effort which any one of us puts forward, in 
the authority of the holy Priesthood to proclaim the truth and declare 
our message to our fellow creatures, is taken up and magnified by 
unseen associates and powers under the control of God, and is carried 
on with influence and power that we little comprehend to the con- 
version of the honest in heart; the seeking out and searching for the 
House of Israel ; the bringing to pass of the glorious purposes of our 
Father and God, in the establishment of his Church and kingdom on 
earth in power. The day is at hand when this work shall be recog- 
nized as established upon the earth in power — "Thy people shall be 
willing in the day of thy power." 

It is for us to qualify by fidelity to the truth ; by faithfulness in 
our prayers ; by observance of our duties as Latter-day Saints in our 
lives, to carry in power to the ends of the earth this message of Al- 
mighty God to his children; to come out from Babylon, from wicked- 
ness, from darkness and error and sin, into the light of everlasting life, 
through the gospel of Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior. Amen. 



ELDER REY L. PRATT 139 



ELDER REY L. PRATT 

(President of the Mexican Mission) 

I sincerely trust, my brethren and sisters, that my voice will 
carry sufficiently far so that all of you may hear. It is to me this 
morning an inspiration to see this wonderful congregation before me. 
I have had the privilege in conferences that are past of speaking from 
these steps to the congregations of the Latter-day Saints in overflow 
open air meetings, but I think never before have I seen so many 
people who were not able to enter the great buildings, the Tabernacle 
and the Assembly Hall, and who because of their desire to hear the 
word of the Lord have congregated themselves upon these grounds. 
We are truly blessed of the Lord today in the magnificent weather. It 
is wonderful how mild it is and how comfortable we are here this 
morning, although I realize perfectly well that you are becoming tired 
from standing. But ii will only be once or twice a year that you will 
be asked to do this, and I would say, brethren and sisters, we would 
appreciate it greatly if you will hear us through. My only desire in 
speaking to you this morning is to teach you the truth concerning the 
gospel of Jesus Christ. 

I find here recorded in Amos these wonderful words, "Surely 
the Lord God will do nothing but he revealeth his secrets unto his 
servants the prophets." And I should like to turn and read to you 
the scripture that is given to the world in what is known as the Articles 
of Faith. "We believe all that God has revealed, all that he does now 
reveal, and we believe that he will yet reveal many great and important 
things pertaining to the kingdom of God." 

I bear you my testimony, my brethren and sisters, that the Church 
of Jesus Christ has been founded and is established upon the principle 
of revelation, and that is the message that we have borne to the world 
since Joseph Smith announced that God himself had spoken to him, 
that his Son, Jesus Christ, had come and revealed his mind and will 
unto him, and we hold it forth as a principle that cannot be contro- 
verted, or set aside, that the kingdom of God must rest upon the rock 
of revelation. We believe that all the events, that have befallen the 
children of men, from the very beginning of time, have been revealed 
even before they happened through the prophets of the Lord to the 
children of men. 

We believe that the Lord is speaking through his prophets today, 
and we also believe that through all time to come, as long as mortal 
man lives upon this sphere, God will reveal himself to his servants 
the prophets and through them to his people. Your boys and your 
girls by the thousands have gone forth as missionaries, and today al- 
most two thousand of them are standing among the nations of the 
earth on this Sabbath morning, and that is the burden of their mes- 
sage. There are ministers of the world who read the scriptures ; there 
are ministers of the world who teach morality ; there are ministers of 



140 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



the world who teach truth in some phases of it, but deny revelation. 
We might go forth, my brethren and sisters, and be learned in the 
scriptures, in science, and in all the learning of the world, but our 
message, like theirs, if robbed of this one great thing, would be a 
dead letter that killeth and does not give life eternal to the souls of 
men. 

We find that the world is not believing in these things, and for 
that reason it seems that we should be stirred up in remembrance; 
for the Lord, through his prophets, has revealed conditions that truly 
and verily prevail in our day, and my desire today is to stir up in 
the hearts of the youth of Zion and the people of the Church a re- 
newed belief in prophets, a renewed belief in the word of revelation. 
We do not need to look for revelation clear back to the time of Moses, 
of all the prophets of the Old Testament, of the apostles of the New, 
and read their word only and the revelations of God to them, but verily 
today men commune with our Father and receive his revelations just 
as those prophets of olden times did. 

Is there any difference in the apostles who sit over here in this 
tabernacle and who stand upon their feet and proclaim their prophetic 
message to the world today, and the apostles who were sent out by 
our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ ? Who was Peter ? Who was James, 
and John, and Paul ? They were men, merely men — but endowed with 
a holy prophetic calling and made apostles unto the Lord Jesus Christ, 
and through them his word came to the world. Who are the men 
who have been endowed with this calling here? They are mortal men, 
but the calling is the same. Know it, ye youth of Zion! When you 
look upon those men, you look upon men as great as the men about 
whom you read in sacred and holy writ. And is there any difference 
in the quality of the prophets, the presidents of the Church, and those 
who have been the mighty prophets of the past ? I say unto you, there 
is no difference. But there is a danger that we do not appreciate these 
things, and there is hanging over the world that wo of Almighty 
God because they have rejected this principle of revelation. 

Behold, what I read unto you is the revelation of the Lord 
through his prophets in times that are past, and we are committed to 
believe in it: "Yea, wo unto him that shall deny the revelations of 
the Lord, and that shall say the Lord no longer worketh by revela- 
tion, or by prophecy, or by gifts, or by tongues, or by healings, or by 
the power of the Holy Ghost ! Yea, and wo unto him that shall say 
at that day, to get gain, that there can be no miracle wrought by Jesus 
Christ; for he that doeth this shall become like unto the son of per- 
dition, for whom there was no mercy, according to the word of Christ." 

It behooves us, therefore, to continue steadfast in this belief. We 
sang at the beginning of this meeting that wonderful, inspirational 
hymn, that should go to the heart of every Latter-day Saint, "We 
thank thee, O God, for a prophet, to guide us in these latter days ;" 
and in this great conference the word of the Lord has come to the 



ELDER REY L. PRATT 



141 



Church through the prophet of the Lord, and that word is, Repent 
ye; and live in harmony with the laws of God and the laws of the 
land. 

Brethren and sisters, can we expect to be blessed and disregard 
this call? I trembled last night as I listened to the words of that 
prophet calling upon the people to live clean lives. It seemed that it 
was not the word of mortal man, but it was the word of God, that 
penetrated to the very center of my being. Brethren and sisters, 1 
bear you my testimony that this, is the word of the Lord. 

The prophets of old have pointed out the conditions that should 
exist in this age. We believe the Book of Mormon to be the word of 
God, and yet we find people who are professed Latter-day Saints who 
are skeptical in regard to some of the prophecies contained in that 
book. Reference has been made this morning to the fact that there 
is a Lamanite mission. I thank the Lord that I am identified with it. 
I thank the Lord that for 16 years I have raised my voice in defense 
of the principles of the gospel and in the teaching of eternal truth to 
the Lamanite nation that live to the south of us, and still I come home 
to find men, my brethren, who say, "surely the Lord can do nothing 
with those people, surely our time and effort is wasted in all that we 
try to do for them." O, my brethren and sisters, can the voice or 
the hand of puny man stay and forestal what God has predicted shall 
come to pass? Who will stand up contrary, to avert the bringing to 
pass the purposes of God? Do we believe what he revealed in re- 
gard to the redemption of that people? I do. And if it takes my life, 
it won't take any more than it has taken of some other men to estab- 
lish the gospel in some of the countries where perhaps some of you 
have come from. It is the Lord's work; he has decreed it, and it 
shall go forth. 

Reference 5 has been made during this conference to the spirit of 
lawlessness that prevails. I think that one of the greatest things that 
endanger this great country of ours is the mistaken conception of lib- 
erty in the hearts and in the minds of the people. The people mis- 
take liberty for license and are becoming licentious. They are un- 
virtuous ; they are unchaste, and they say they are so because they are 
free to do what they wish to do. They engage in disastrous strikes 
and imperil the life and limb and liberty of their fellow men, because 
they say they are free. Beware of a false freedom, of a false liberty, 
that transcends the bounds of true liberty, true freedom, which comes 
with the exercise of truth and the knowing of it. The prophet of the 
Lord has called us to repentance in regard to these things. Now, my 
brethren and sisters, can we consistently fail to give heed to his warn- 
ing? I should like to read to you the word of the Lord, as it came to 
the prophet as recorded here in the 30th chapter of III Nephi. The 
prophets of old and the prophets of modern time sound the same 
warning. Under the inspiration of the Spirit of the Lord, President 
Brigham H. Roberts of the First Council of Seventy and President 



142 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



of the Eastern States mission, sounded a warning to the Gentile na- 
tion of which we form a part. Through prophetic vision the prophets 
of old foresaw our day ; they foresaw the evils that would come in 
among us ; and resounding down through the ages come to us the 
words of the prophets of old, by way of admonition and a call to 
repentance, that I should like to read to you. It is to us, in so far 
as it is applicable in that we are guilty of any of the things men- 
tioned here, and it is to the great nation of people known as the United 
States of America, directed specifically to them as a call to repent- 
ance. And let me say here that their very existence upon this con- 
tinent is conditioned in this great prophetic book upon their living in 
harmony with the gospel of Jesus Christ, and not rejecting him; and 
when they do reject him, wo, wo unto them: 

"Hearken, O ye Gentiles, and hear the words of Jesus Christ, the Son 
of the living God, which he hath commanded me that I should speak con- 
cerning you, for, behold he commandeth me that I should write saying, 

"Turn, all ye Gentiles, from your wicked ways, and repent of your 
evil doings, your lyings and your deceivings, and of your whoredoms, and 
jour secret abominations, and your idolatries, and of your murders, your 
priestcrafts, and your envyings,, and your strifes, and from, all your wicked- 
pess and abominations, and come unto me, and be baptized in my name, 
that ye may receive a remission of your sins, and be filled with the Holy 
Ghost, that ye may be numbered with my people who are of the house of 
Israel." 

Should we write a catalog of the crimes to which this people are 
most addicted today, would we not name the very ones that the prophet 
calls the people to repentance of in this great prophecy? Is the na- 
tion chaste? Is it true? Are they not deceivers? Are there not 
abominable secret combinations that threaten the very foundations of 
our society? There are, and the Lord holds forth a means of escape 
from these things. He has not cast the people off. No ; his arm is 
yet extended, even as in times of old, when he would have gathered 
the people together even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her 
wing. But he will not, if they will not. No force, no coercion will 
be used. But in the due time of the Lord, his calamities and his 
judgments will be poured out, to let the world know that God will 
not be mocked, that he is at the helm, that this is his work and we are 
his creatures. So the great cry today to Israel, to the world, to us 
all, is repentance. And the great message to the world that should 
be delivered here at home and in the nations abroad by your sons and 
by your daughters, is the fact that God speaks again and that he will 
continue to speak right down to the remotest moment of time. 

I live in a part of the country where recent occurrences have 
brought very forcibly to my mind some conditions. You will note 
in what I read here that the Lord spoke in regard to secret combina- 
tions. Now, I would like just to say a word — and let it be known 
that it is not mine, but it is the word of the prophets of the Lord, a 
warning word and a voice raised to give us a key by which we might 
understand and know danger when it appears. 

WhT'fore, O ye Gentiles, it is wisdom in God that these' things should 



ELDER REY L. PRATT 



143 



be shewn unto you, that thereby ye may repent of your sins, and suffer 
not that these murderous combinations shall get above you, which are built 

up to get power and gainj, and the work, yea, even the work of destruction 
come upon you, yea, even the sword of the justice of the eternal God shall 
fall upon you, to your overthrow and destruction, if ye shall suffer these 
things to be ; 

Wherefore the Lord commandieth you, when ye shall see these things 
come among you, that ye shall awake to a sense of your awful situation, 
because of this secret combination which shall be among you, or wo be 
unto it, because of the blood of them who have been slain; for they cry 
from the dust for vengeance upon it, and also upon those who build it up. 

For it cometh to pass that whoso buildeth it up seeketh to overthrow 
the freedom of all lands, nations, and countries; and it bringeth to pass the 
destruction of all people, for it is built up by the devil, who is the father 
of all lies; even that same liar who beguilded our first parents; yea, even 
that same liar who hath caused man to commit 1 murder from the beginning; 
who hath hardened the hearts of men, that they have murdered the prophets, 
and stoned them, and cast them out from) the beginning. 

If the temptation comes to you to join these super-governments, 
as they are called, those invisible empires that swear allegiance greater 
to their own organization — although it be within the organization of 
the great United States — than they swear to the constitution of the 
country, remember the words of the prophet, for it is of the devil, 
and it will bring destruction to the person and to the community and 
to the nation that will foster it and will permit it to grow and become 
a power in their midst. 

The voice of the Lord through his prophets is calling us to re- 
pentance from these things. O, why, why, brethren and sisters is it 
so? Where is the intelligence that the Lord gives us? We can see 
that to live within the law is best, is safest. Why are we so prone to 
live outside of the law ? Why should we make ourselves a power unto 
ourselves and prescribe that part of the law that we should live ? Did 
the Lord command us not to kill? He did. We all believe that we 
should not kill. Was it a different one that told us not to steal? No. 
Was it a different one that told us not to bear false testimony? No. 
Was it a different one that told us not to make or traffic in or sell 
or drink bootleg whisky? No. For through his prophet he has told 
us not to do those things. Was it a different one that told us not to 
drink tea and not to drink coffee? No. It is the same one, and we 
are disobeying him when we do those things, and the judgment of God 
sooner or later will come upon us. Was it a different one than the 
one that told us to be chaste, to be virtuous, to be true, and to be 
clean? No, it is the same one, my brethren and sisters. So let us 
obey him. Was it a different one that told us to go into all the world 
and preach the gospel, unto every creature ? No. It is the same one ; 
and whether those creatures reside in Mexico or whether they reside 
in Siberia, or whether they reside in India, when the call of God comes, 
O, tirethren and sisters, let us lay all we have upon his altar, and let 
us go and keep his commandments and cleanse our garments of the 
blood of the generation in which we live. 

I am happy to have had the privilege of speaking to you for a few 



144 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



moments here this morning. I wish, in conclusion, to bear you my 
testimony that I know that God lives, he is my Father, he reveals 
himself to the children of men. I know that Jesus Christ is the Son 
of God, the Only Begotten Son of God in the flesh, and that he came 
in the meridian of time and wrought out a salvation and a redemption 
for the children of men. Passing over the time of the apostasy, I 
testify to you that God and his Son, Jesus Christ, in answer to a 
humble prayer of that prophet boy, Joseph Smith, came to him and 
spoke to him and revealed to him what God is. I testify to you that 
from him came messengers bearing the holy message of the gospel 
and the power of the Priesthood, and that the power of the Priesthood 
was committed to the Prophet Joseph Smith by which power he or- 
ganized the Church and put in operation the great work that has 
brought us together here today. I testify that, given to him by the 
Angel Moroni, he translated the plates from which the Book of Mor- 
mon was taken, and gave to us a "new witness for God" in the world. 
I testify to you that he received from God further revelation and in- 
spiration — every word that is contained in the Book of Doctrine and 
Covenants, and it is the law and the will of the Lord unto us, his 
people, here today. 

I testify to you something more; that every man who has stood 
as the successor of that great prophet has held the same keys of 
prophetic leadership and apostleship that he held. There has been no 
mistake, from Brigham Young right down to the man whose voice it 
is the privilege of all of us to hear in this great conference here 
today. I testify to you that Heber J. Grant is a prophet of God ; and 
the man who rejects his words, the man who rejects his counsel, re- 
jects it to his own peril in the world. 

The Lord bless you ; the Lord help you to live as Latter-day 
Saints should live, and bear up the part assigned to you in this great 
work; for our Father's children are everywhere yet hungering and 
thirsting for righteousness. O, brethren and sisters, compared with 
the joy it brings ta them, how little is your sacrifice, after all, in send- 
ing forth your boys and your girls — being without them, scrimping to 
support them! O, if you could only feel and know and see the joy 
that comes to those whom they reach, I know that your hearts would 
be made glad. Sacrifice brings forth the blessings of heaven. Can we 
give more than our Savior gave? Think of what he did for us. 
Then, next, can we do more than the Prophet Joseph did? Think of 
his life and what he did and what he gave. Just where we stand in 
the conflict, that; is our place ; just where we might think we are use- 
less, let us not hide our face ; for God has placed us here for a purpose ; 
whatever it be, let us think that he has chosen us for it. Let us work 
loyally. The Lord bless you is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

The congregation sang, "Redeemer of Israel, our only delight." 
The closing prayer was offered by Patriarch William Jex, of 
Springville, Utah. 



SECOND OVERFLOW MEETING 



The second overflow meeting was held in the Assembly Hall, 
Sunday afternoon, 2 o'clock, October 8, 1922. Elder Seymour B. 
Young, president of the First Council of Seventy, presided. 

The Twenty-first ward choir and the congregation sang, "The 
Great Millennial Morn." 

Prayer was offered by Elder Rodney C. Badger. 

The choir sang the anthem, "Fear not, O Israel." 

ELDER SEYMOUR B. YOUNG 

{President of the First Council of the Seventy) 

My brethren and sisters, While I stand here after witnessing your 
unanimous votes sustaining the general authorities of the Church, I 
express to you my thanks for the union of purpose that you have 
evinced. When the Prophet Joseph Smith was martyred he was 
taken, as he expressed himself, "like a lamb to the slaughter," yet he 
willingly laid down his life for the people, because the enemies of the 
Saints at that time swore in their wrath, if they could not get pos- 
session of the Prophet and deal with him as they wanted to, they would 
lay the city of Nauvoo in ashes, and that was, in my opinion, one of 
the main reasons why he yielded himself into the hands of wicked men 
in the defense of the Church, to preserve the Church, and the peo- 
ple ; and he fulfilled the words of the Master in that splendid saying, 
"No man hath greater love than that he will give his life for another" 
- — for his friends, for his brethren. 

I believe that it was the thought of the Latter-day Saints at that- 
time, that if the Prophet went to Carthage, that his enemies would 
not have power to kill him. So thoroughly had the Saints become 
impressed with his calling by the eternal Father, and by his Son Jesus 
Christ, that they were satisfied that no harm could come to him until 
he had finished his work. But it appears that he had finished his 
work at this time. He had organized the Church and set in order 
every quorum of the Priesthood, the apostles, the high priests, the 
seventies, the elders, the priests, the teachers, and the deacons. 

He had supervised the organization of all the quorums and com- 
pleted the organization of the Church, when he said, "I am going as 
a lamb to the slaughter, but I am innocent and my conscience is void 
of offense towards God and man." On the twenty-seventh day of 
June, 1844, he sealed his testimony with his blood in company with 
his brother Hyrum, who also, as Patriarch of the Church, sealed his 
testimony with his blood. The presiding authority came to the twelve 
apostles with President Brigham Young at the head, and he seems 
to have filled the prophecy made by the Prophet Joseph, when they 
first met in Kirtland, that some day, Brigham Young would lead the 
Church. This was at a prayer meeting where the Prophet Joseph 



146 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



presided and Elder Brigham Young in his prayer spoke in tongues, 
moved upon by the Spirit of God, and when he had ceased praying the 
Prophet continued in the same tongue that Elder Brigham Young had 
spoken in, and as he closed his remarks, he said, "My brethren and 
sisters, the tongue that Brother Brigham spoke in, and I have con- 
tinued in, is the pure Adamic language spoken by our father Adam," 
and it is from the Lord. 

President Brigham Young after the martyrdom of the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, in a large congregation assembled in Nauvoo in the 
grove near the temple, was endowed with power from on high at 
that meeting, and hundreds and thousands of the Saints testified that 
they saw the mantle of Joseph fall upon the Prophet Brigham Young, 
and that Joseph's voice came from the lips of Brigham Young, and 
the power and the testimony of the Prophet was in his utterances. It 
seems to me that something of this kind was necessary, because the 
people had become sorrowful after the martyrdom because of the many 
apostates that had sought to lead the Church astray, and this very 
providential manifestation seemed to satisfy the Saints. From that 
time they knew that Brigham Young was the prophet, seer, and rev- 
elator and President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints, and that the power of his prophetic ministry had been manifest. 

He led the Saints out of Nauvoo in trying times, and he planted, 
in what is now the state of Nebraska, a colony of white people who 
settled in that state at Winter Quarters, now known as Florence, in 
the year eighteen forty-six ; and the next year, eighteen forty-seven, 
he led a company of pioneers and planted their feet here in what is 
now Salt Lake City, and as he entered the valley at the mouth of 
Emigration Canyon, he said, "This is the place," and that predic- 
tion upon that occasion was prophetic absolutely — "This is the place!" 
He had a vision in which he saw these mountain valleys peopled with 
Latter-day Saints far and near, and no doubt he remembered the 
prophecy made by Joseph Smith in the little town of Montrose on 
the 12th day of August, eighteen forty-two, that the Latter-day Saints 
would be driven to the Rocky mountains and there become a great 
people. That prophecy was in part fulfilled by President Brigham 
Young and this people colonizing these valleys of the mountains, east, 
west, north, and south, which were afterward organized into the state 
of Utah and surrounding states. After Utah had been established, 
he sent a colony, first, into Idaho, the first settlement of white people 
in that state. They settled upon the Salmon river in 1855, and 
there builded Fort Limhi for protection against the Black Feet Indians. 
In the year 1855 he sent a colony to locate in the state of Nevada, un- 
der the direction of Elder Orson Hyde of the Council of the Twelve. 
This colony was located in what is known as. Carson Valley, the first 
white settlers in the state of Nevada. In California, as early as 1846, 
was established the first white colony, being composed of Latter-day 
Saints. This colony came in the ship Brooklyn which sailed from 



ELDER SEYMOUR B. YOUNG 147 

New York on the 4th day of January, 1846. They landed at San 
Francisco bay on the 18th day of July, 1846, making the voyage 
around Cape Horn in six months time. In Arizona we can claim 
that the Latter-day Saints were among the first to plant permanent 
white colonies. President Young was the founder and the mover in 
organizing the University of Deseret, which has since become the fa- 
mous University of Utah. The B. Y. University, located at Provo, 
was founded by him, as also the Brigham Young College at Logan. 
The L. D. S. University, located on the bock east of the Temple, is 
another project of his, and the first building that was erected was 
the Brigham Young building, and later there have been erected the 
Barratt Hall in the Center of the block and the Joseph F. Smith 
memorial building, on the north side of the block, one of the largest 
and most up-to-date structures belonging to this Latter-day Saint Uni- 
versity. Then was added the L. D. S. Gymnasium, one of the very 
best equipped gymnasiums west of the Missouri river. President Brig- 
ham Young was raised up and prepared for this great work, and he 
magnificently stood the test and the responsibility placed upon him in 
leading the Saints to these mountain valleys and in founding these 
magnificent institutions of learning for their upbuilding and progress, 
and paving the way for the colonization of surroundng states at the 
same tme. I believe and know that God led him to accomplish these 
great things, and in the words of one of our most excellent hymns 
we may sing as we did at first: 

"We've found the place which God for us prepared, 

Far away in the West. 
Hefe none shall come, to hurt or make afraid. 

Here the Saints will be blessed. 
We'll make the air with music ring. 
Shout praises to our God and King, 
Above the rest, these words, we'll tell, 

All is well, all is well." 

Far be it from me to fail in paying a proper tribute to the great 
and good men who have succeeded President Brigham Young as 
leaders of this people. They, too, have each been under the inspiration 
of the Lord Almighty, in directing the affairs of the Church. Presi- 
dent Heber J. Grant has been an inspiration to the people everywhere, 
and has done much to remove prejudice and to make friends for the 
Latter-day Saints. He is indeed a prophet, seer and revelator to this 
people, and a true and faithful president of the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints. May the Lord bless him and the Saints forever, 
I pray through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. 

ELDER SAMUEL O. BENNION 

{President Central States Mission) 

I hope that the Spirit of the Lord may direct my remarks, that 
what I may say may be in accordance with his holy mind and will, 



148 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



for the good of all who are gathered here. I do not remember a more 
beautiful Sabbath, at this time of the year, than today, when everything 
seems favorable to us, everything seems saturated with the spirit and 
the power of our Father in heaven. Surely his Spirit has been made 
manifest to a very great extent in the sessions of the conference thus 
far. I think I have never attended a conference when there seemed 
to be a greater interest, when the people themselves seemed more de- 
voted. The large numbers in attendance show that the Spirit of God 
is upon the Latter-day Saints and in their hearts. They have a de- 
sire to be taught that which will do them good for all time to come. 
They desire to serve God and keep his commandments more than they 
have ever done before. 

As the Church grows older its influence must be greater. There 
is a growth in all scientific lines in the earth. The great discoveries 
that have been made by men in the last few years are far in advance 
of the theology of the churches of the day. They have not advanced. 
And truly this Church, under the divine inspiration of our Father 
in heaven must stand as the fountain head of all of the wisdom that 
comes to men, for God has revealed it and he makes known to his 
people his mind and will if they will but listen. I firmly believe that 
the truths that have been revealed to men in the dispensation of the 
fulness of times, in which we live, have had their beginning in the 
principles of truth that are found in The Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints. 

A short time ago I heard a man of international fame deliver a 
lecture in Kansas City, before a convention of Sunday School workers. 
I heard this gentleman say, that there are one or two passages of scrip- 
ture in the Bible that are worth more than all the books that have 
been written from time to time by the so-called professors of the day. 
One of them which he drew attention to is the doctrine which plainly 
declares that God "created man in his own image, male and female." 
He said there are many men and women who do not believe that 
scripture; but he said, "the Bible teaches it." I never heard this 
doctrine taught, in my experience out in the world, before, save by 
the elders in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, but I 
want to assert to you, that it would not surprise me at all if in the 
very near future it should be taught by many of the leading sects of 
the day. I believe it will not be long until there shall be teachers who 
will be preaching the doctrine of an ante-mortal state. They will be 
teaching in plainness that mortals had a preexistence. I believe that 
there shall be men arise not of our faith who will declare that there 
is a salvation for the dead, and that men may live and attain the 
blessings of the almighty Father if they have not forfeited their right 
to those blessings in mortality. The law of tithing is taught in many 
of the churches of the day. The principle of divine healing as taught 
and practiced by Christ and his ancient apostles is taught in many 
of the so-called Christian sects. Whoever asks of God in the name 
of his Son Jesus Christ, may receive, and with the light that came 



ELDER SAMUEL 0. BENNION 



149 



into the earth through the visi station of the Father and the Son to 
the Prophet Joseph Smith, and the visitation of holy angels, the 
principles of truth will find lodgment in the hearts of the honest 
among the children of men, and God's Church shall receive more en- 
dorsement and greater influence than ever before. 

It will be found, then, when they shall attempt to teach the prin- 
ciples and doctrines of Christ, that in our day, for more than ninety 
years the principles of eternal truth as taught in the Bible and re- 
vealed in the Book of Mormon and Doctrine and Covenants have 
found place in the hearts of the children of men. 

One of the first things that the Prophet Joseph Smith taught 
was, that he had beheld the Father and the Son, that they were im- 
mortal men, that he was in their image. He declared this with bold- 
ness, and it has now been preached by this people for nearly a hun- 
dred years. It has been testified of in all the civilized nations of the 
earth, where the elders of Israel have been sent. And when men 
begin to lay claim to the principles of Christ they will have to ac- 
knowledge that there was a prophet raised up in the dispensation in 
which they live ; and a people raised up through him, who have taught 
these principles ; that God has revealed these things in plainness unto 
the children of men, and that he has revealed to us the true state of 
the world and the truth with respect to all his creatures. And then 
they will have to admit the superiority and the originality of God's 
truth in the earth, for the Lord has never allowed any son or daughter 
to come to the earth but he has provided a way for them to live and 
be taught the truth. 

And when men testify that they know that Jesus is the Christ 
they will be confronted again with this fact, that the testimony of 
Jesus is the spirit of prophecy, and that as men receive the testimony 
of Jesus they must believe in prophecy. And when they believe in 
prophets they must acknowledge that God revealed his mind and will 
to prophets. They will have to turn again to the true order of wor- 
ship, and they will find again that God has revealed his truth to the 
children of men, and has raised up men, and conferred upon them 
divine authority to proclaim his truth. Then they will come to know 
that the true gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored, and is preached 
with power in the earth. 

And now I want to say that the man that is at the head of this 
Church truly* is a prophet of the living God, a man who was ordained 
to that calling before the earth was created. And associated with him 
are men of power ordained to stand in the name of God in the earth, 
which power will remain until the Lord shall come. When a man 
questions the divine authority of this Church, he needs only to in- 
vestigate the doctrines of the Church and listen to the preaching of 
the men who declare the gospel. To my mind the man to whom I 
referred has read "Mormonism." There are thousands that believe it, 
but had it come from a "Mormon" elder, it is a question if they would 
have received it at all. 



150 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



I want to say to you that the Lord will raise up men who will 
further his cause in the earth by allowing them to preach parts of 
the restored gospel. The apostles in the days of Christ saw men 
who were casting out devils in his name, and they forbade them, but 
Jesus said, "He that is not against us is on our part." That same 
privilege is in the earth, for men and for women to stand for the 
right, and to stand for the gospel itself, no matter where they have 
heard it, no matter where they obtained it. There will come a time, 
just so surely as the sun shines, that they will have to acknowledge 
that to the Church of Christ in the days of the dispensation of the 
fulness of times, our Father gave that light and that power with 
authority to declare it to the children of men. I fully believe that 
the gospel as it is taught by the servants of God bearing divine 
authority, will find place in the hearts of thousands as the result of 
the faithfulness of the men of God who have declared it, and that 
in many of the churches of the day the restored gospel will be taught, 
and it will establish faith in the hearts of men. Sooner or later, men 
and women will be drawn unto the Lord, through prayer, and shall 
seek him by faith and by study and they shall discover that that 
knowledge of the truth, and that light and knowledge of God and his 
gospel came through the Church of Christ in this day, and that Joseph 
Smith was a Prophet of God through whom it was revealed and re- 
stored to the earth, who sealed his testimony with his blood ; died for 
the truth which through him God gave to the world. He became a 
martyr to the cause of Christ, and no man ever became a martyr for 
the cause of Christ without having known him and the truth that he 
declared, though that truth be preached by men who are not called 
of God. We pray that the honest in heart, may be honorable enough 
to admit, when it is brought to their attention, that the truths which 
they have been taught, were received through the Prophet of the Lord 
in the day in which we live, and that they must repent and believe the 
gospel; that the law that John taught is in force and in effect for 
people who have not been baptized by men having authority. And 
that in order to partake of the glorious principles of Christ, they 
must enter into the straight gate and live according to the truth and 
the laws that has been revealed for their salvation. 

I pray for the children of men. I pray for the honorable men of 
the earth, men and women who are blinded by the cunning crafti- 
ness of men who deceive by teaching doctrine that is not true. I pray 
for the Latter-day Saints, that they may walk uprightly before the 
Lord, that they may testify before the world that God lives, and that 
they may rejoice in the truth which comes to them through these con- 
ferences and through attending to the duties of Saints of God upon 
the earth. May we all feel determined in our hearts to live the lives 
of Saints, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

port."

ELDER GEORGE F. McCUNE 

(Formerly President of ihe Eastern States Mission) 

At the beginning of our services, Brother Badger, acting as 
mouth for all of us, asked the Lord, in his prayer, to inspire those who 
should speak to us his words for our comfort and well-being. I be- 
lieve that prayer has been literally answered thus far in those who 
have spoken, and I desire that I may say nothing that shall detract 
from that beautiful spirit and inspiration which has been our portion 
here today. 

I delight to meet with my brethren and sisters, but I find it a 
great task to attempt to talk to you. I feel that the Saints perhaps 
know just as much about the gospel as I do. It would be a great 
privilege to meet a congregation of this size in the world, and de- 
liver to them the gospel message ; but I always sense my weakness 
in standing before the Latter-day Saints. Yet I do know our Father 
in heaven makes no requirement at our hands except he gives us the 
power to magnify that requirement or calling ; so I respond cheerfully, 
trusting in the Lord, and what I do in this Church I do in the name 
of the Lord, for I do know, by my experience, that we have the gospel 
of our Redeemer, the true gospel of Christ, and the more I know of 
it the more I love it, the dearer it is to my heart. 

There have been so many good things spoken in this conference 
that I feel in my heart you will love to go home and leave with the 
Saints, in our wonderful institutions. 

As Brother Bennion was comparing the meetings of our annual 
and semi-annual conferences, a thought came to my mind. I went 
into a convention the other day, and as I went in I could not help 
but notice the terrible condition that was manifest in that meeting, and 
I knew as I stand here, that the people were deluded. They thought 
the same, perhaps, of me, but, "by their fruits you may know them." 
At this meeting here, it seems as if all have met with one purpose of 
heart. In the meeting I refer to, there was no union, no peace, but 
there was everything contrary to union and peace, and T never saw 
such contortions in my life as I witnessed in that little meeting. 

I bear testimony that we have the true gospel of the Redeemer. 
It is a privilege for us to live in this great dispensation of the fulness 
of times when we have the true gospel of our Lord, and we should 
take pleasure in keeping his laws and commandments. It is a priv- 
ilege that we should prize. It is a privilege, I think, when we prop- 
erly understand our position and the blessings that are promised as 
our reward, and we should cheerfully be obedient to the command- 
ments of the Lord for the blessings that we are seeking and which 
have been promised by our Father. We all want happiness, we all 
want something which we are craving for. I believe that strict obedi- 
ence to the commandments of God will bring us that which we seek. 
I believe there is no other way under heaven whereby we can get that 



152 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



which we greatly desire, except by a strict obedience to the gospel and 
the laws of God. When our Father in heaven said. Thou shalt not 
steal, he did not place on his children a hard burden, but he gave them 
something that would contribute to their peace and salvation. He 
gave them the commandments because he loved them. So we in all our 
experiences and vicissitudes of life should learn to love God and to 
keep his commandments. Our people should learn to love the prin- 
ciples and requirements of the gospel, and should love to conform to 
them according to the spirit in which they are given for they are all 
elevating, even in this life, and through them, in their completeness, 
we may be exalted in the life to come. 

I recently returned from California. I was astonished while 
there at the wonderful devotion and interest shown by our people in 
the gospel of our Redeemer in that portion of the vineyard. I first 
attended our Sunday school, in the vicinity of Ocean Park. I was glad 
to behold that the little hall would not wholly hold our Sunday school 
children. As many as 25 children had to stand. On the same day 1 
attended the services at Los Angeles ; and when I left that place a 
little over three years ago, their chapel was ample to accommodate 
them all. When I returned I found that little chapel was wholly in- 
adequate for the Sunday night meeting, and every available space was 
taken for standing room. On the next Sabbath I visited another 
branch, where the chapel was built about a year ago. In that time 
the building has become inadequate. The next Sunday I attended 
services in our little chapel in Ocean Park. It is estimated that about 
1200 attended our services there, and the new chapel was inadequate 
to hold the people. I find those people are taking a very active in- 
terest in the gospel, a keener interest even than they had taken at home 
here. Brethren and sisters, I glory in this, but I regret it very much, 
so far as we at home are concerned. We should recognize it as a 
privilege to perform our duties in the Church, and to obey the require- 
ments made upon us in our day, the dispensation of the fulness of 
time, and we should not look upon our duties as hard to perform. I 
believe the gospel plan given to us is the plan by which we can come 
back into the presence of God, through working out our salvation in 
this life. Let us find joy and satisfaction in our work in this life; it 
is not a hardship to conform to the requirements of the gospel ; but 
we will find true happiness in rendering obedience to the gospel. 

There are so many principles in the gospel as we understand it, 
and if we will conform our lives to them, we will have our reward in 
this life, and in the life to come more than we can conceive in our 
present state; as a reward for our faithfulness. 

The brethren have spoken much about our respect for law and 
order. I wonder if it is possible that the listlessness that comes to us 
is the result of our own actions in the past. I would not say that I 
believe our actions are reflected in the attitude of our children, or the 
ideas of our children. I remember being out where we wanted to 



ELDER GEORGE F. McCUNE 



153 



make a certain distance in a certain time. The young men who were 
with me said in the presence of their officers, and to my two sons, we 
will make it, if we go in a hurry. Now I believe that the violation 
of the speed law will be brought home to those men, who were will- 
ing to go outside the law in hurrying forward in the automobile. 1 
believe that men will take advantage, and I believe that boys and men 
who overstep the law, will take advantage and license from the ac- 
tions of others that are brought home to them. So, I believe we should 
resolve in our hearts to cultivate respect for law, and thus wherever 
we may be found, use our influence to have the laws obeyed and to 
produce a respect for law in the minds of all, not only for ecclesi- 
astical authority, but all authority. It is no trouble to respond to the 
requirements of the president of these United States, and I believe we 
should take pleasure in responding to every requirement of law and 
order, not only from the president, but from all including the least 
official who acts under him. And in this way I believe we should 
teach our own children respect for authority. Now may we have 
respect and confidence in the authority placed over us by the Lord ; 
and I believe that we will find real joy and satisfaction in honoring 
the deacon in his place. I believe he should be honored as bearing the 
Priesthood of God. I feel that I would like to honor every man who 
acts in the authority, either of our country, or of the Church of God, 
upon the earth, and teach my children to do likewise. And this I 
would teach all whom it is my duty to teach, as opportunity may 
afford. 

I did not intend to take so much of your time. It is a wonder- 
ful privilege we have of meeting together and partaking of the spirit- 
ual blessings that God has for this people, in these conferences ; I 
wish we could fully appreciate them, for just as sure as you sit before 
me this Sabbath day, God lives, and Jesus is the Christ, the Savior 
of the world, and Joseph Smith was his chosen instrument through 
whom the gospel has been restored to earth and it is our privilege to 
honor his memory and have respect for and render obedience to all 
the principles and laws revealed through him for our earthly happi- 
ness and eternal salvation. May we likewise render obedience to all 
who have succeeded the Prophet Joseph. My brethren and sisters, 
I bless you through the authority my Father has given me, in the 
name of Jesus Christ our Redeemer. Amen. 

ELDER HEBER C. IVERSON 

(Formerly President of the Northwestern States Mission) 

I can assure you, my brethren and sisters, that I keenly sense the 
mighty responsibility that is now mine, for I feel its weight when I 
consider that I am addressing many who have come from afar, and at 
considerable expense, with a desire to receive from the Lord through 
his ministry, by the inspiration of his spirit, encouragement and spirit-

ual strength which may be of assistance to them in their work in the 
wards and stakes of Zion. I am sure that up to the present moment you 
have not been disappointed, and I sincerely trust that up to the closing- 
prayer we may continue to enjoy the outpouring of divine light and 
intelligence which has characterized the remarks of all the speakers 
who have previously spoken. I have in my heart only one desire, and 
that is, that the Lord will grant me his choice blessing that I may 
impart unto you eternal principles pertaining to our salvation in his 
presence, that we may all be imbued with the spirit of diligence and 
devotion to his work, and fulfil the requirements devolving upon us ; 
that we may perform all of them and conform to all the ordinances 
pertaining to the gospel of Jesus Christ, which is the power of God 
unto salvation, and is not a mere imaginary affair, but a reality ; a 
living, vital power in the lives of those who permit it to come into 
their lives. 

I rejoice in the statement, made last evening by President Heber J. 
Grant while addressing the assembled priesthood, that for no other 
one thing is he more grateful to the Lord than that throughout the 
nations of the earth where he has traveled, including the wards and 
stakes of Zion, there prevails among the Saints an abiding faith in. 
and a knowledge of, the divinity of this work. This is the secret of its 
strength. Upon this cornerstone, my brethren and sisters, it is estab- 
lished, and it shall prevail; it shall triumph; it shall overcome event- 
ually all the enemies of truth, of light, and of life. It is not alone 
amongst those who stand in high positions, that this splendid pos- 
session, this excellent knowledge, is possessed, it is found amongst the 
humblest, the meekest, the lowliest, and the most obscure among us, 
provided they are faithful in devoting themselves to the Lord's work 
and requirements. A glorious thought ! It is, indeed, the very secret 
of our strength. How has it come to us? How shall it be maintained? 
In the manner in which it was obtained, and in no other way can it 
be a continued possession in our lives, making for our salvation ; for 
remember that the gospel's purpose is not to save men in their sins, but 
from their sins, and that it is God's power brought into our lives 
with that definite objective, and it is revealed by him and not an 
imagination. As Brother McCune has said, there is no principle or 
ordinance of this gospel that has not its reward in blessing of faith 
and power from heaven ; for there is a law irrevocably decreed from 
the foundations of the world, on which all blessings are predicated, and 
whenever we receive any blessing from the Lord, it is by obedience 
to the law upon which it is predicated ; no blessing in the gospel can 
be obtained and enjoyed except by obedience to the requirements of 
that law to which it belongs. 

An old sayi:ig, very frequently repeated, is, "We learn to do by 
doing." May I paraphrase that, and this is equally true, We learn 
to know by doing. No man can know except he does. The Master 
Teacher has made clear that truth, for he said, "My doctrine is not 
mine, but, his that sent me; if any man will do his will, he shall know 



ELDER HEBER C. IVERSON 



155 



of the doctrine, whether it be of God or whether I speak of myself." 
Those words are simple and positive, we obtain a testimony through 
obedience, and only in a continuation of faithfulness and obedience 
can we retain that testimony; for we can lose it by disobedience just 
as we gain it by obedience. One is just as logical as the other. 

The time is so brief, we can but touch a few high points. I will 
quote a few words from an eminent author who illustrates the prac- 
tical phase of gaining knowledge, and this principle holds true in gain- 
ing knowledge of the truth which will save us and which is the most 
precious possession within the power of man to gain. I read you a few 
words from an eminent Chautauqua lecturer, "Nobody can give us or 
buy us an education ; we earn it in the university of hard knocks, in 
the school of service. Nobody can give us or buy us a great arm ; 
we earn it in physical service. Nobody can give us or buy us a great 
mind ; we earn it in mental service. Nobody can give us or buy us 
a great character ; we earn it in moral service." I add this thought : 
Nobody can buy or give us salvation in our Father's kingdom ; we earn 
it through divine service, performing every requirement made of us 
from on high. 

Again, quoting our author, he says, "We do not know what we 
memorize ; we only know what we vitalize ; we only know what we 
live." Then he goes on to say: "We shall have finished our education 
when all the strife and discord and evil and bitterness and selfishness 
have been pounded out of our lives ; and when peace, harmony, love, 
wisdom, understanding, and unselfishness fill them. Eternity alone 
can finish our education. As we overcome, we ascend the mountain 
of life ; we rise above the legacy of our limitations ; we rise above 
troubles and storms into sunshine; we rise to life's mountain summit 
and see the night below us ; we have reached the new eternal day on 
the summit, God's commencement day." We have then graduated and 
are prepared to enter into the great university of our Father, when we 
have obeyed absolutely and strictly the regulations, and learned well 
the lessons, of this school room of human experience, to which our 
Father has sent us for a wise and glorious purpose. And then shall 
we find a glorious realization of the supreme desire or prayer of our 
souls, expressed in the inspired words : 

When I leave this frail existence, 

When T lay this mortal by, 
Father, Mother, may I meet you 

In your royal courts on high? 
Then, at length, when I've completed 

All you sent me forth to do, 
With your mutual approbation 

Let me come and dwell with you. 

It is just as real as my life and your life ; if is precious, immortal, 
and triumphant; it is just as true and just as reasonable and just as 
natural as any other thing in all the universe. 

My testimony, in conclusion, is that our Father lives and rules in 



156

yonder heaven, and that his Son is enthroned on the right hand of 
glory. They revealed themselves to the boy Joseph Smith, and they 
did commission him to establish the gospel and Church of Jesus Christ, 
in this the fulness of time, for the salvation of the world ; and I know 
this is true ; and in order that we may enjoy its blessings we must 
consecrate to this work all that we have and all that we are. I trust 
that we may all do so, and that we may eventually receive the great 
reward of eternal life in the celestial kingdom of glory, I pray in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 

{President of the Southern States Mission) 

Brethren ' and sisters, our hearts are glad because the Lord has 
shown us the path to' eternal life. In his service there are joys that 
fill the heart to overflowing. 

On my way to South Carolina, a few days ago, the passenger train 
on which I was riding was delayed four hours. A freight engine run- 
ning ahead of this passenger train ran off 1 the track. Enquiring from 
one of the railroad men the cause of the engine being derailed — for 
the track appeared to be in good condition — I received this reply : "The 
engine was running 'light.' It had no cars — no load to pull. The 
engineer was driving it at high speed. If the engine had been pulling 
a train it would probably have kept on the rails." 

I pondered over this answer. How many men in this republic 
are running "light?" Shakespeare makes one of his characters say: 

"Let me give light, but let me not be light. 
For a light wife doth make a heavy husband." 

If there were more men who would take upon themselves the nat- 
ural and God-ordained responsibilities of this mortal life, that is to 
say, if there were more men who were heads of families, assuming 
the duties of life there would be fewer strikes and less industrial dis- 
turbance. 

The Latter-day Saints are a great people because they are en- 
gaged in a great work and they sense the responsibilities thereof. They 
have not made this work great, but the work has made them great. 
It is God's work. What is the mission of the Church? It is a glo- 
rious one. In the Book of Mormon the Lord said to one of his proph- 
ets : "For my work is not yet finished ; neither shall it be, until the 
end of man ; neither from that time henceforth and forever." Yes, the 
Almighty hath a work. It must be a noble one, a work of power and 
glory worthy of the Majesty on high. The Lord said unto Moses: 
"For behold, this is my work and my glory; — to bring to pass the 
immortality and eternal life of man." And this work will go on 
throughout the countless ages of eternity. 

Blessed are the Latter-day Saints for they have been called by 
the Master to perform a great and far-reaching work pertaining to the 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 



157 



salvation of the souls of the children of men. The Lord says that we 
are called to lift up our voices "as with the sound of a trump, both 
long and loud, and cry repentance unto a crooked and perverse gen- 
eration, preparing the way of the Lord for his second coming." 

This is the mission of this Church, to warn the world by the 
preaching of the everlasting gospel proclaiming to the world that the 
coming of the Lord is nigh at hand. He is coming to judgment, to 
reward the righteous, to bring to pass the resurrection of the right- 
eous dead ; and to reward every man according to the deeds done in 
the body. "And even so I have sent mine everlasting covenant into 
the world," saith the Lord, "to be a light to the world, and to be a 
standard for my people, and for the Gentiles to seek to it, and to be 
a messenger before my face to prepare the way before me." 

In sublime faith in the spirit of service and sacrifice, meeting 
every form of prejudice, your sons and daughters are proclaiming the 
truth to the children of men, at street meetings, in halls, cottages and 
houses of worship. They are preaching the gospel as a witness and 
a warning to the nations of the earth preparatory to the glorious sec- 
ond coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. 

As I listened to President Grant, President Penrose and Presi- 
dent Ivins I thought of the splendid lives of these men. What a 
great blessing to the people of the world and especially to the Latter- 
day Saints they are and have been. 

And the same may be truthfully said of all the leaders of the 
Church both past and present, and it will be said of those who will 
follow. God said to the Prophet Joseph Smith: "And thy people 
shall never be turned against thee by the testimony of traitors." Our 
leaders instruct us by the power of the Holy Ghost and their words are 
carried by that power unto our hearts. We rejoice in the fulness of 
the gospel and thank God that Israel is led by prophets, seers and 
revelators. 

Almost at the commencement of his communication to Joseph 
Smith, the angel Moroni said that God had a work for him (Joseph) 
to do. In what spirit did the Prophet Joseph perform that work? 
In the spirit of service and sacrifice. He lived for others. On his 
way to Carthage, knowing that he was going to his martyrdom, in 
the splendor and nobility of his soul, he exclaimed: "If my life is 
of no value to my friends, it is of none to myself." We are living 
for others. We want to be of service to our fellow men, to our 
country, to our God. I believe from the bottom of my heart that this 
faith which the world designates as "Mormonism" is the spiritual force 
that is saving the world from bursting asunder into spiritual an- 
archy. The young people have the faith of their fathers in their hearts, 
and it is the faith that is the power of God unto salvation. The mis- 
sionaries go into the world with the light and inspiration of the Holy 
Spirit to deliver their vital message in the name and power of Jesus 
Christ. 

God, in his spiritual firmanent, has set constellations of spiritual 



158 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



power and righteousness "for the perfecting of the Saints, for the 
work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ." Chief 
among these is the First Presidency of the Church. So long as the 
Latter-day Saints look to these spiritual guides, the Presidency and 
the Twelve, and obey their counsels, they will never go astray. These 
inspired men are servants of Jesus Christ. The Redeemer is the 
head of the Church, the chief corner stone of our salvation and faith. 
Without him we can do nothing. In keeping counsel and in doing the 
things the Lord shall command them the Saints will walk in the glo- 
rious light of truth : they will share the glory of the first resur- 
rection, and the great gift of salvation will be their eternal reward. 

May God help us to keep our vision from being blurred by the 
deceitfulness of riches and the cares of the world. May he help us 
to live and preach the gospel to help mankind to keep from perishing 
spiritually, to teach our children to be true to their leaders, to them- 
selves, loyal to their country and to God, is my humble prayer, in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang. "Awake, my soul." 
Benediction was pronounced by Elder Frederick E. Barker. 

SECOND OUTDOOR OVERFLOW MEETING 

The second outdoor overflow meeting was held at the Bureau 
of Information at 2 o'clock, Sunday, October 8, 1922. Elder J. 
Golden Kimball, of the First Council of Seventy, presided. 

The Holiday choir rendered the music and singing, Charles Pike, 
conductor. 

The choir sang, "Come, dearest Lord." 

The invocation was offered by Elder George W. Lewis, of the 
Bureau of Information. 

The choir sang, "We're not ashamed to own our Lord." 

ELDER NEPHI JENSEN 

(President of the Canadian Mission) 

Someone asked Mark Twain if he knew of anything that is worse 
than to have the earache and the toothache at the same time. Mark 
Twain said, "I think it would be a little worse to have sciatic rheu- 
matism and St. Vitus dance at the same time." I am quite certain that 
if Mark Twain had ever occupied a position like this, he would not 
have given that answer. 

I feel very deeply conscious of my limitations in attempting to 
speak to this audience on this occasion. I would not make the at- 
tempt were it not for the faith that I have that God will sustain and 
uphold all those who trust in him and seek humbly to do his will. I 



ELDER NEPHI JENSEN 



159 



pray with all my heart that God will be kind to me while I attempt to 
speak to you, and that he will give me his Spirit to actuate my utter- 
ances, that I shall be able to say the things that ought to be said, 
and say them in the way that they ought to be said. 

I am thankful with all my heart for my heritage. I am thankful 
for membership in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
1 am thankful that God, in his kindness, has given me a testimony 
of the truth ; and that he has written upon my heart by fire of the 
Holy Ghost a certain knowledge of the divinity of this great work in 
which we are engaged. I am thankful that in the goodness of our 
heavenly Father I have been permitted to represent this great Church 
upon the firing line of truth for over seven years of my life. I am 
thankful that God has sustained me in this ministry and enabled me, 
by the power of his Spirit, to touch the hearts of honest men and 
women by my testimony of the truth. 

During the last three years and three months I have become more 
strongly convinced than I have ever been in my life of the world's 
need of "Mormonism." It is my deep-rooted conviction this day that 
the world needs "Mormonism" more than anything else. Indeed, I am 
persuaded that the truth, the faith, and the spirit which are found in 
this Church are the only things that can save this world from going 
to pieces, socially, politically, and economically. 

Some months ago I picked up a copy of the Literary Digest, and 
found in it a lengthy advertisement, which had been written by a com- 
mittee of the World Inter-Church Movement. The advertisement 
covered an entire page in the magazine. In the very heart of this 
advertisement appeared this pregnant sentence, ''The world needs a 
great many things, but it needs most of all faith." I do not know who 
the man was who wrote that sentence, but I do know that he did pack 
into a few words a comprehensive, simple statement of the paramount 
need of this world. Yes, this world "needs most of all faith ;" and it 
needs a deeper faith than the insipid belief which we find resident in 
the hearts of a great many of our orthodox Christian friends. The 
world needs the faith that Jesus taught. 

About two years ago I had the pleausre of speaking to a con- 
gregation in the great city of Montreal. In opening my discourse I 
said to the congregation, "We have come to teach you the faith that 
Jesus taught." I had no sooner made that seemingly trite statement 
than a number of persons in the congregation laughed almost out 
loud. I noticed a number of persons turn to their neighbors and whis- 
per something about what I said. I am quite certain that they meant 
by their demonstrat'on to manifest to me that they had already had 
the faith that Jesus taught preached to them. But I am quite sure, not- 
withstanding the demonstration of those people, that there are very 
few people in all this world today who have really heard about the 
faith that Jesus taught. 

What was the faith that Jesus taught? The Apostle Paul under- 
stood quite fully the doctrines of the. Son of God. He understood the 



160 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Christian doctrine of faith. He wrote a wonderful essay on this sub- 
ject. It is found in the 11th chapter of his letter; to the Hebrews. In 
this letter, Paul says, "Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, 
the evidence of things not seen." 

In this definition Paul tells us, in effect, that to the person who 
has faith, unseen things are evident, or, in other words, that to the 
person who has faith, God is evident. The person who has faith has 
a lively, certain assurance of the existence of the invisible God. I 
know that that is the kind of faith Paul is talking about here, because 
in this same chapter he refers to Moses as a man who had this "evi- 
dence of things not seen." Of this man Moses, Paul wrote, "By 
faith," Moses forsook Egypt, "not fearing the wrath of the king: for 
he endured, as seeing him who is invisible." What does Paul mean? 
He means that Moses, because of the purity of his life and the integrity 
of his soul, was so close to God that he could almost see God. That 
is faith. Nothing short of this certainty is real Christian faith. When 
you think of faith in this sense, you will understand that it is one of 
the rarest qualities you will find in human souls. I have sometimes 
said in great cities in the east, "You do not have a thousand persons 
in your city who have Christian faith." 

But Paul also tells us that "faith is the substance of things hoped 
for." He means that faith is the assurances we have that we will 
receive the things we hope for. And the apostle is not here talking 
about any ordinary human hope. He is not here talking about the 
hope that the mechanic has that at the end of the week he will re- 
ceive his pay. Neither is he speaking about the hope that the scientist 
has that in the ordinary processes of nature certain things will come 
to pass at certain times. Paul is here talking about a deep, strong, di- 
vine hope. He refers to Abraham as a man who had this "substance 
of things hoped for." Of this man Abraham, Paul said, "By faith 
Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had re- 
ceived the promises offered up his only begotten son of whom it was 
said, that in Isaac shall thy seed be called, accounting that God was 
able to raise him up, even from the dead." Notice the words: "ac- 
counting that God was able to raise him up even from the dead." 
These are wonderful words. They are powerful words. They came 
from a great, heart. They came from a soul that was pure enough, 
true enough, and strong enough to trust God, even to the uttermost. 
One who has this certain assurance of the willingness of God to bless 
his children, even to the uttermost, if they trust in him, has "the sub- 
stance of things hoped for." 

It was of this kind of faith that Jesus spoke when he talked about 
this principle. There were in his day a few souls who were noble 
enough and pure enough and strong enough to trust in Jesus Christ. 
One of these rare souls was a woman who had been afflicted for 
twelve long years of her life. This woman, we are told, spent her 
fortune upon the physicians and received no relief. One day she was 
standing in the throng as Jesus came walking along. She had heard 



ELDER NEPHI JENSEN 



161 



of the purity of his life and the mighty works which he had performed 
by the power of faith. As he came into sight, her heart leaped for joy 
and she said within herself, "If I can touch the hem of his garment, I 
shall be healed." Did you ever notice those sublime words? Did you 
ever notice that wonderful profession of faith? Those strong words 
came from a big heart. They came from a soul that was deep enough, 
and strong enough to trust God, even to the uttermost. That noble 
woman, prompted by her sublime faith, touched the hem of the garment 
of Jesus Christ. Instantly she was healed. Jesus knew that some 
noble soul had come into contact with him. He turned to his) disciples 
and said, "Who did touch me?" His disciples had not seen anything. 
They were not spiritually minded at that time. They were still of 
that class of whom Shakespeare spoke when he said, "They are only 
alive in their duller parts." Any person who has not living faith in the 
living God is not half alive. The disciples said, "The throng press thee 
and sayest thou who did touch thee?" But Jesus made reply, "Some- 
one did touch me, for I perceived that virtue hath gone out of me." 
Then the true hearted woman came into his presence, and said, "I did 
touch thee." Then Jesus made reply and said, "Thy faith hath made 
thee whole." 

That woman had Christian faith. She had the faith that Jesus 
taught. She had the faith that he exemplified in his ministry. 

But alas, that faith was driven from this earth by superstition. 
The loss of this faith to the world is the saddest thing that has hap- 
pened in the history of man. The turning of faith into superstition 
after the first establishment of the Christian religion, did not take 
place in a day. It came about very gradually. The people of that 
day, soon after the establishment of the Christian religion, discovered 
that it is easier to trust in something that they could see than it is 
to trust in the invisible God. So they commenced to thinking that 
Peter, and Paul and James and the rest of the apostles had a power 
peculiar to them. They soon concluded that they could not enjoy the 
same power that the apostles had. Then they commenced to think 
that if they could just get a piece of an apostle's coat or cloak and 
wear it upon their person, it would ward off disease and evil spirits. 
So in a very natural way the practice of believing in relics came into 
existence. 

A little later they commenced to thinking that there was some 
magical power in the cross upon which Christ was crucified, and that 
if they could just have a metallic likeness of that cross fastened about 
their neck, it would keep away sickness and evil spirits. You know it 
is so much easier to hold on to a cross fastened about your neck 
than it is to hold on to the throne of God. 

Then a little later still they commenced to thinking that if they 
could just have an image of one of the apostles, and kneel before that 
image and pray a formal prayer before it, they would be able to re- 
ceive blessings from the invisible God. You know it is much easier 
to trust in an image right before you than it is to trust in the God 



162 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



that you cannot see. So in a very natural way, the faith that Jesus 
taught, the faith that the Christ exemplified, was turned into super- 
stition. And error drove truth from the altar. 

But thanks be to our God, he has not left the world without the 
hope of a better day. Through his prophets, he has made it known 
to us that the gospel of Christ and its power should be restored to 
the world in the dispensation of the fulness of times. In fulfilment of 
those wonderful prophecies, Joseph Smith the prophet restored to this 
world the faith that Jesus taught. On that beautiful day in the morn- 
ing of the Nineteenth Century, when the boy Joseph Smith prayed 
and God the Father and his Son, Jesus Christ, appeared to him, faith 
was reborn. On that day the faith of the Christ came back to this 
world. The spot on which he prayed that day is one of the holiest 
spots upon this earth. It is the cradle of faith. 

The story of that boy's triumphant faith, of his all-conquering 
prayer, has kindled in the hearts of tens of thousands the same faith. 

I recall a beautiful story that I heard in the city of Toronto some 
months ago, just on the eve of my departure for the city of Montreal. 
The following day I was in the city of Montreal, and as I walked down 
St. Catherine Street in that great city, I saw a newsboy with a Mont- 
real Standard. Across the top appeared these big headlines, "The 
Greatest Miracle of Modern Times." I purchased a copy of the paper 
and turned to page 16, and read there the story of radio. The writer 
claimed that radio was the greatest miracle of modern times. But I 
was just a little disposed to take issue with his statement. I am 
fashioned somewhat after the Scotch: I do not always believe every- 
thing that I hear. So I commenced to thinking, really is radio the 
greatest miracle of modern times? I did not have to think back very 
far to be convinced that I had heard of a greater miracle. Just the 
night before, in the city of Toronto, before I took my train for Mont- 
real, I sat in my room in the mission home and listened to a little 
English woman tell the story of the tribulation and the trials that came 
to her shortly after she joined the Church. She said, "I was so greatly 
tried one day that I rushed into my little room, closed the door, and 
threw myself upon the bed and wept and prayed for comfort. While 
I was praying I heard a voice behind me' distinctly say, 'Be patient; 
be patient ; wait.' " 

That is a greater story than the story of radio. It is a wonder- 
ful thing to be able to hear a prima donna sing on the other side of 
the globe. But it is an infinitely greater thing to hear the voice of 
God speaking comfort directly to your own soul. Where did that little 
English woman get the faith to trust in God to that extent that she 
was able to get a definite answer to her prayer? She got that faith 
from reading the story of the restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ 
in our dispensation. That is the most thrilling story in the world ex- 
cept one. It is the story that this world needs to awaken its faith in 
the living God. For the old story tells about God's power in the world 
so far back that people are not able to trust in it. What this world 



ELDER NEPHI JENSEN 



163 



needs is the story of the restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ. 
What this world needs is a down-to-date story of the power of God 
in the world. "Mormonism" is the only religion in the world that 
furnishes the world such a story. 

And I know that the story of the restoration of the gospel is true. 
With all the power of my soul I thank God for this testimony. I 
value it above the price of rubies. If any one should come to me this 
very hour with a billion dollars upon a golden platter and say to me, 
"You can have this if you will give up and surrender your testimony 
of the truth," I would turn from that gold as if it were dross; for 1 
have learned in the furnace of affliction that there are a great many 
things that you cannot do with money. You cannot knit together the 
broken pieces of human will with money. You cannot heal the 
wounds of the human heart with gold. You cannot bring peace to 
the human soul with rubies. There is nothing in the world that i? 
true enough and strong enough to bring peace to the human soul but 
living faith in the living God. 

I love those words of that humble poet Whittier : 

Y.et in the maddening maze of things, 

When tossed by storm and flood, 
To one fixed stake my spirit clings; 

I know that God is good. 

I know not where his islands lift 

Their fronded palms in air; 
I only know I cannot drift 

Beyond his love and care. 

I do know that those dear words are true. I do know that this 
religion of ours is God-given, God-instituted. I know it is the best 
and truest thing in the world. God give us power to live it to the 
end of our days, and to do all in our strength to declare its truths, to 
the end of the world, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER B. S. YOUNG 

(President of the Northwestern States Mission) 

I do not know how successful I shall be in making you hear me. 
I have not had very much opportunity as yet to do outdoor speaking, 
and particularly to such a throng of people as is assembled here today. 
1 am grateful for this opportunity, my friends, brethren and sisters, 
although it makes me feel a good deal like the story that Brother 
George H. Brimhall tells of two fellows who were going into the bat- 
tle. They were both trembling a good deal, and one of them, who 
was in the rear, said, "Say, you seem to be awful scared there in 
front," and the fellow in front said, "If you were half as scared as I 
am, you would be five miles in the rear and running like — well." And 
I want to say, brethren and sisters, that sometimes in the timidity of 
our souls we fail to live up to the things that we know.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



As has been announced to you, I have the honor of presiding over 
the Northwestern States mission; I have the honor of being tempo- 
rarily a parent to your boys and girls. 1 wish we had more of them. 
1 want to say to you that no sweeter, no finer specimens of boyhood 
and girlhood can be found in all the broad confines of the earth. They 
are indeed the salt of the earth. And we are endeavoring to teach 
them the things that are vital, and they are learning them with a 
rapidity that is almost startling. We have boys and girls come out 
into the field who unhappily have had but little teaching at home. 1 
do not say that it is the fault of the parents or of the bishop of the 
ward or of any of those who have charge of the spiritual education of 
our boys and girls, but the fact is that at whose ever door it may be 
laid, they are almost unacquainted with the principles of the religion 
to which their parents have given their unbounded allegiance. It is 
marvelous how rapidly they acquire a knowledge of the gospel. It 
seems to be as natural to them to understand faith, repentance, bap- 
tism, and the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost — the 
first principles of the gospel — as it is to breathe. 

We are endeavoring, brethren and sisters, in the teaching of your 
boys and girls, to make of them good citizens, not only of the Gov- 
ernment, but also of the Church ; and, as was said yesterday here in 
the tabernacle by Dr. Widtsoe, the one thing lacking in the education of 
all people, with few exceptions, is they have not been taught spirit- 
uality. We do study the physical ; we give great attention and spend 
almost unbounded treasure on the cultivation of the mental, but the 
spiritual is almost wholly neglected. We are endeavoring, during their 
tenure of missionary service, to give them an understanding of the 
spiritual. 

And what will this spiritual acquisition do for them that the 
physical and the mental does not accomplish? These boys and girls 
have been taught in the schools that they should observe certain lines 
of conduct, largely for the purpose that they may acquire substance. 
Our whole educational system has for its object the teaching of boys 
and girls how to acquire material things. When these boys and girls 
go into the mission, they are brought into a new atmosphere. There 
are new channels of communication between them and nature that are 
opened up of which hitherto they had no conception. And those chan- 
nels are of the most highly developing character, because they give 
the boys and girls a view of life they had not previously had, and 
that no men or women can have without having the experience that 
comes to the missionary. That experience, to my mind and with the 
thought I have given the subject, is one of the most useful and nec- 
essary of anything of which I have conception, for the reason that it 
gives the boys and girls a foundation upon which to build their future, 
that they cannot acquire in any other way. 

We have labored, my friends, to give our boys and girls a large 
patrimony, when we shall have passed on into the great eternity. No 
matter how hard we may strive, no matter what we may leave them, 



ELDER B. S. YOUNG

we are placing in their hands, in many instances wholly inexperienced, 
the opportunity of ruination. But when you have sent a boy or girl 
into the mission field, you have sent them into a school for the acquir- 
ing' of that which is more useful, more necessary, and will be to them 
what no material possession can possibly furnish ; for you have taught 
the boy or girl, or they have acquired, a faith in God, the faith that 
Brother Jenson has been speaking of. Do- you know of anything that 
is more desirable in its possession than faith in God? It is the thing, 
as has been said, that the world lacks ; and if you can give your boys 
and your girls faith in God, you have supplied them with that which 
no patrimony, no matter how generous, can possibly confer upon them ; 
because the patrimony is a thing that moths may eat, that rust may 
corrupt, that thieves may steal ; but when you have given them faith in 
God, or an opportunity to obtain it, you have given them that which 
nothing earthly can deprive them of, and it will go with them into the 
eternities. 

We have had boys and girls come out there — I have seen them, 
although I have been there but a short time — who have been unedu- 
cated in the things of the gospel. But send them out without purse 
or scrip, to do what we term summer work, and they will be gone a 
couple or three months, and when they come back, note the difference 
in the appearance of the boy or the girl ! Their whole being has un- 
dergone a complete change. They are no more like the boy or girl 
they were when they came out than if they were two different beings 
entirely. They come back with a faith in God. And when they stand 
up, you know that they have a faith in him. You can see it in their 
countenances ; you can feel it in the clasp of their hand ; you can hear 
it as the words roll from their lips, as the tears stream from their eyes 
in their gratitude to God, who has preserved them and blessed them 
and given them a testimony that he lives, that he hears and answers 
prayers, that he is indeed our Father. And if you give your boys and 
girls an opportunity to acquire that faith, you have given them some- 
thing that you cannot possibly confer if you leave them no matter 
what treasure of an earthly character. 

Now, we need missionaries. This has been my preface to the state- 
ment that we need missionaries, and we need them very badly. I know 
of instances where there are boys and girls in the mission field who 
are being supported in some instances by widowed mothers and those 
mothers have said to me, "I do not see how I can possibly keep my 
daughter in the mission field, because our crops have no value; it 
won't pay to dig our potatoes ; I have no means of supporting her 
except that which I borrow and which I must look to her to help me 
to make good when she returns." That is faith, a living faith, because 
of the desire to have that daughter acquire this thing to which I have 
referred, faith in God. My confidence in this community is of a 
character that if they knew that here is a girl in the mission field, or 
a boy, or any number of them, who need and who are being sup- 
ported by widowed mothers, there are men and women who, if they 



166 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



knew those facts, would say, "We will support them until their mis- 
sion is concluded." They are out there looking for, searching for, 
combing society for' honest souls, and if, as the scripture says, our joy 
shall be great with one soul whom we shall bring to repentance, how 
much greater will that joy be if we shall bring many in the presence 
of our Father — now, if our joy is to be great with one soul or any 
number of souls, so also great will be our joy if we contribute to the 
maintaining of these boys and girls who are without means, to help 
them finish their missions. And I believe that some movement will 
be started in the communities, by which a fund may be established, so 
that these boys and girls can be kept in the mission field. I know 
that you have no accurate idea of the value of those boys and girls in 
your communities after they return if they keep the spirit of the 
mission in their hearts. 

I want to appeal to the parents in this congregation and the par- 
ents throughout all Israel : If you want to give your boys and girls 
something that will be vital and lasting, give them the opportunity 
of a mission, and you will have conferred upon them that which you 
cannot possibly bestow in any other way. They are beautiful in the 
lives they lead, and the men and women who see them going about their 
daily toil have remarked to me when they have known that I am a 
Latter-day Saint, as they have seen them standing on the streets preach- 
ing the gospel of repentance, that never have they seen finer speci- 
mens of boys and girls, who radiate! more intelligence, and to whom it 
has been a greater delight to listen and to know than these, your boys 
and girls, who are doing service in the mission field. It is a beautiful, 
a valuable thing, and will be of eternal use to them if you will give 
them an opportunity of enjoying it. 

And I want to say that we are endeavoring to teach them this 
great fact, that wherever they are, no matter at what time nor under 
what circumstances, they are always missionaries of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Are you ? That is what your 
boys and girls will ask you: Are you missionaries of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints? Are you willing to do the things 
that they are doing? Are you willing to follow in the footsteps of 
these beautiful boys and girls, who are teaching the gospel of the 
Lord Jesus Christ? Do you teach it? That is a question for you 
to ask yourselves. They are teaching it. Are you teaching it? You 
can be of vast use in this Church if you will teach the gospel. Pri- 
marily you have no other business in this world than to teach the gos- 
pel that God has revealed for the salvation of his children ; and if you 
will analyze your lives, analyze the object of your being here, you will 
conclude that you are here for the purpose of furthering his interests 
in the earth among his children ; and I commend to you the sug- 
gestion that as you have opportunity, give your boys and girls the 
chance of a mission. You will never regret it; it will stand eternally 
to your credit ; because you will have saved your boys and your girls, 
than whom there is nothing more precious in all the earth. That God 



ELDER B. S. YOUNG 



167 



will help us to understand and appreciate our opportunities, I humbly 
pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

A ladies' chorus sang, "Lift Thine Eyes." 

The general authorities were presented and sustained unanimously, 
as at the Tabernacle meeting. 

ELDER BENJAMIN GODDARD 

{Of the Bureau of Information) 

I do not know how my voice will carry in this large assembly, as 
I have been suffering with a cold for some days. I am very glad to 
be with you in this open air meeting and to observe how many there 
are in this audience who are members of the Church. It is truly won- 
derful to observe the growth and development of this Church from 
the beginning. We are distinct from all other people upon the face 
of the earth, for we are members of a living Church ; we have all the 
authority upon the earth that God ever gave unto men ; and with that 
power and influence, is it to be wondered at that Zion should grow 
and increase, until, by and by, this block will not contain the hosts 
of Israel that come to conference. I was asked this morning if it 
would not be a good idea to build another Tabernacle similar to the 
one that is now crowded with nearly twelve thousand people, and I 
remarked to the good brother who made the inquiry that if we wanted 
to accommodate in meetings all the people who desired to come here, 
we must roof in the whole block and hold meetings in every corner 
thereof. 

I am glad to observe the increase in faith and the growth and de- 
velopment of the work, as we see it today. While President B. S. 
Young was speaking I was contemplating how this work really com- 
menced. Let us briefly review it from the lowly beginning, when 
the boy Prophet Joseph Smith, between the ages of 14 and 15, went 
into the grove near Palmyra, New York, to pray. Think of that 
wonderful demonstration when the Father and the Son appeared unto 
him and gave instructions to him to prepare for the great mission 
that had been assigned unto him. It was a marvelous event, and 
Joseph scarcely realized the important work unto which he had then 
been called. Subsequently this was impressed more forcibly upon 
him by the appearance of John the Baptist, who conferred upon the 
youthful prophet and upon Oliver Cowdery the authority of the holy 
Priesthood, as recorded in section 13 of the Doctrine and Covenants. 
Later the heavens again opened, and angelic messengers conferred 
upon these two men the. authority of the Melchizedek Priesthood with 
all its gifts, powers, and blessings, and this authority has continued 
with the Church until the present day. Thus by the direct ministry 
of angels the Church was fully established. I draw your attention to 
these marvelous manifestations so that you may understand how God 



168 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



has blessed his Church and caused it to grow on the earth. Do you 
marvel that the prophet Joseph should burst forth in song when con- 
templating all that God had done for him? In section 128 of the 
Doctrine and Covenants, after referring to the restoration of the 
holy Priesthood, and after proclaiming the opening of a new dis- 
pensation through divine ministration, the prophet utters these im- 
pressive words : 

"Now, what do we hear in the gospel which we have received? A 
voice of gladness! A voice of mercy from heaven; and a voice of truth 
out of the earth; glad tidings for the dead; a voice of gladness for the 
living and the dead; glad tidings of great joy. How beautiful upon the 
mountains are the feet of those that bring glad tidings of good things, and 
that say unto Zion: Behold, thy God reigneth! As the dews of Carmel, 
so shall the knowledge of God descend upon them! 

"And again, what do we hear? Glad tidings from Cumorah ! Moroni, 
an angel from heaven, declaring the fulfilment of the prophets — the book 
to be revealed. A voice of the Lord in the wilderness of Fayette, Seneca 
county, declaring the three witnesses to bear record of the book ! The 
voice of Michael on the banks of the Susquehanna, detecting the devil 
when he appeared as an angel of light! The voice of Peter, James, and 
John in the wilderness between Harmony, Susquehanna county; and Coles- 
ville, Broome county, on the Susquehanna river, declaring themselves as 
possessing the keys of the kingdom, and of the dispensation of the fulness 
of times! 

"And again, the voice of God in the chamber of old Father Whitmer, 
in Fayette, Seneca county, and at sundry times, and in divers places through 
all the travels' and tribulations of this Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints! And the voice of Michael the archangel; the voice of Gabriel, and 
of Raphael, and of divers angels, from Michael or Adam, down to the 
present time, all declaring their dispensation,, their rights, their keys, their 
honors, their majesty and glory, and the power of their Priesthood; giving 
line upon line, precept upon precept; here a little, and there a little; giving 
us consolation by holding forth, that which is to come, confirming our 
hope ! 

"Brethren, shall we not go on in so great a cause? Go forward and not 
backward. Courage, brethren; and on, on to the victory! Let your hearts 
rejoice, and be exceedingly glad. Let the earth break forth into singing. 
Let the dead speak forth anthems of eternal praise to the King Im- 
manuel, who hath ordained, before the world was, that which would enable 
us to redeem them out of their prison ; for the prisoners shall go free. 

"Let the mountains shout for joy, and all y.e valleys cry aloud; and 
all ya seas and dry lands tell the wonders of your Eternal King! And ye 
rivers, and brooks, and rills, flow down with gladness. Let the woods, 
and all the] trees of the field praise the Lord; and ye solid rocks weep 
for joy! And let the sun,, moon, and the morning stars sing together, and 
let all the sons of God shout for joy! And let the eternal creations declare 
his name forever and ever! And again I say, how glorious is the voice we 
hear from heaven, proclaiming in our .ears, glory, and salvation, and honor, 
and immortality, and eternal life; kingdoms, principalities, and powers." 

This is how the Prophet Joseph felt when contemplating the 
wonderful revelations given of the Lord. 

You have heard our brother here speak of the elders and their 
influence and what they are able to accomplish. These young men 
and young women, not only in the Northwestern States mission, but 



ELDER BENJAMIN GODDARD 



169 



in every mission of the Church are wielding the same wonderful in- 
fluence. What is it that gives them this power? What is it that 
singles them out from the multitude as men of a different class, having 
different qualifications and different personalities? What is it that 
impresses the people as they gaze upon these youths and listen to their 
earnest testimonies ? Strangers upon this block, when entertained 
by guides, often ask, "What have your young people got that impresses 
us so much? What is it that distinguishes these young people?" It 
is the Priesthood of Almighty God, and without that we would be no 
more successful in missionary work than are all others of the various 
contending creeds. 

You brethren have received the Priesthood of Almighty God. Our 
youths hold the Aaronic Priesthood. They are proud of it. They are 
glad to exercise it. Our elders labor in the authority of the Priesthood 
of Melchizedek. Look over this audience. I think possibly President 
Kimball will be glad to know the character of this great assembly. I 
noticed when we voted sustaining the authorities of the Church that 
some raised their hands carelessly while others raised their hands high. 
I feel to bless the man who in a whole-souled manner sustains the breth- 
ren. Now appealing to you men in the congregation, a great many of 
you have received this Priesthood given to us by the revelations of 
God, by the ministry of angels, as referred to. How many of you 
in this audience, within the sound of my voice, hold this Priesthood? 
We want to learn by the show of hands. All of you that hold the 
Priesthood, raise your hands. I notice nearly all 'of you have re- 
sponded, God bless you all. 

Now, let me give you a final exhortation. I urge you to magnify 
that Priesthood ; live according to every covenant made with God, and 
let him feel that you are worthy of this divine power. If the same 
vote were called for in the Assembly Hall, and again in the Taber- 
nacle, ten thousand hands would readily be raised confirming the 
thought that upon this block today there are thousands and thousands 
of men, clothed with the authority and power of Almighty God. May 
the Lord help us to appreciate and to magnify it, that we may be as 
lights set upon a hill, that cannot be hid, I pray in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL 

{Of the First Council of the Seventy) 

Before I say anything else, I have something on my mind I 
want to get rid of first. I call attention to this picture — you cannot 
see. it very well at so long a distance. We have on this platform 
Brother William Jex. He was a great friend of my father's, and if 
he could not think of anything else to say he began to talk about Heber 
C. Kimball. This good man is 92 years old. He is a patriarch. He 
lives in Spanish Fork. I read the notation written under the picture 



170 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



he handed to me. He did not imagine I would read it. This picture 
shows, "a part of the family" — there is a multitude of Jexes, this 
picture being only a part of the family "of William and Eliza Jex, 
taken at their annual family reunion held January 1, 1914." Thirty- 
eight members of the family then living were not present — (could not 
get them all in!). "William and Eliza Goodson Jex were married in 
England, February 22, 1854."' That is one year after I was born. I 
am now going to tell you what damage they have done since. They 
embarked on a vessel bound for America. "The family now consists 
of the aged couple, eleven children, 115 grandchildren, 151 great- 
grandchildren, and five of the fifth generation, making a total, on 
October 1, 1921, of 360 — including 64 who have become members of 
the family by marriage. Seventy-four of these have died." 

Now the climax comes. "The Jex family has spent altogether 76 
years in the foreign missionary service, preaching the gospel, at an 
expense of $70,000 of their own means, over and above all their time 
for which they received no compensation. 

I call that faith and works. It puts me in mind of what my father 
said in talking in early days about this people. He said : "This 
people will multiply and increase until we will hardly know where to 
put them." Father told the Gentiles, "You will never be able to kill 
them off." Brother Jex has taken part in fulfiling this prophecy. 

It is not my purpose to talk very much. I haven't an outdoor 
voice. I have been trying to be sick for a couple of years, and I have 
rather fizzled out on it. I feel a good deal like the story I read the 
other day. "Some fellow was sitting on the pier that reached out into 
the ocean> — and he fell in, and he holloed, "Help! help! I can't swim." 
And an old fellow was sitting on the pier fishing, and he said : "Neither 
can I, but I wouldn't brag about it." I don't want to brag about sick- 
ness, because it is a kind of a disgrace to get sick in this Church, and 
not have faith to be healed. I was talking in one of the stakes of Zion 
to a bunch of careless Seventies, and I was trying to inject into them a 
little faith. Some fellow bawled out, "How do you get faith?" Well, 
it was such a sudden shock to me, I said, "I'll be blamed if I know." 
I told one of the greatest truths I have spoken for some time al- 
though somewhat crude. How do you know how you are going to 
get it? How do you know when you are going to get it? Nobody 
does. It just comes. And then it goes, and sometimes we do not 
have faith. That is about the way I have been since I have been sick. 
I have not had faith to be healed, and I have been ashamed. But 
I want to testify to you, and then read something into the record, and 
then quit. I guess there is a reporter here, isn't there? I am always 
afraid of those "blooming reporters ;" they always get things down as 
I say it, but it don't sound well. It sounds all right when I deliver it, 
but it doesn't read well in print. I don't know whether you believe 
what I say or not, and I don't care. All I care for is to finish my work, 
deliver my message, get through with this business, and if God can see 



ELDER ]. GOLDEN KIMBALL 



171 



fit in his mercy to give me salvation, that is all I want ; it is a mighty big 
thing to ask for — for the greatest gift of God to his children is salva- 
tion." My mother started out for a celestial glory. It is too big a 
climb for me. If I can get salvation, 1 will be happily surprised. Heber 
C. Kimball said : "If some of you 'Mormons' get salvation, you will 
be more surprised than anybody else." 

There are some things I know just as well as any Latter-day Saint 
knows. I am old enough to know a thing or two. I ought to know 
pretty near as much as some people who haven't had any more ex- 
perience than I have. My only trouble is that I may lack authority 
to do and say some things, but I have got! all I can attend to. I have 
ordained hundred of Seventies. I do not know but it is thousands. 
Eight hundred and ninety Seventies have been ordained since Janu- 
ary 1, 1922. Some of them are little good, but I did my work all 
right. I have set apart hundreds for foreign missions, and they have 
come back, many of them, and said, "Everything you promised me 
came true." 

I have seen the sick healed under my administration. I have wit- 
nessed nearly all kinds of diseases cured. And I will say right here, 
as far as God is concerned, and Jesus Christ, there is no disease that 
is incurable, if faith is exercised. I know that I have the key, that I 
hold the Priesthood, and there isn't a man in all the world to make me 
believe that I have not got it. It may be I do not live up to all the 
requirements — I will now begin to read into the record. I write books, 
but I put them in a pigeon hole and lock them up where they cannot 
do any damage. I feel aroused sometimes and the palms of my hands 
just itch to take hold of the jaw-bone of an ass and beat these things 
into dull men's skulls; I would do it, too, if I only had the jaw-bone. 
This is what I want to read to you. I want you to think about it. It 
is nothing new. But I want you to think about it as I have thought 
about it ; for I have read it dozens of times, and that is one big reason 
I am a member of this Church. If I did not believe what I am going 
to read, I would quit the Church tomorrow. 

These are the Prophet Joseph Smith's words. The Prophet 
Joseph Smith's words of instructions to apostles, at the last meeting 
held prior to their leaving on missions. You remember when that 
was, when they went to England and to other places. He said : 

"Brethren, I have desired to see the temple built. I will never live to 
see it, but you will. I have sealed upon your heads all the keys of the 
Kingdom of God. I have sealed upon you every key, power, principle, 
that the God of heaven has revealed to me." ( You see we received all 
the keys.) "Now, no matter where I may go or what I may do, the 
Kingdom rests upon you." [See? He fixed that; he knew something 
about what was going to happen.] 

President Wilford Woodruff, who was one of the most wonderful 
men I ever knew — was a man who talked to me occasionally ; I never 
arose after a five-minutes' talk that I did not know that he was a 



172 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



prophet of God. He made these remarks at a Mutual Improvement 
conference, held June 2, 1889: 

"Do you wonder why we, as apostles, could not have understood 
that the prophet of God was going to be taken from us ? Neither could 
the apostles in the days of Jesus Christ understand what the Savior 
meant when he told them, 'I am going away ; if I do not go away, the 
Comforter will not come.' " President Woodruff continued : 

"Joseph Smith made these impressive remarks on the same oc- 
casion, 'Ye apostles of the Lamb of God, my brethren, upon your 
shoulders this Kingdom rests ; you have got to round up your shoulders 
and bear off this Kingdom. If you do not do it, you will be damned.' " 
— And so will the rest of us, if we do not do our duty. 

President Brigham Young said, after the martyrdom of the 
Prophet, "Thank God, the keys of the Kingdom are here." 

President Wilford Woodruff continued, "The keys of the King- 
dom will remain with the Church until the coming of the Son of Man, 
which means until the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ in the clouds 
of heaven to reward every man according to his deeds done in the 
flesh. There have always been manifested among a certain coterie of 
men, who say that Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, and others who 
have been presidents of the Church were not the right men to lead the 
Church." [I have heard that same thing said hundreds of times. I 
have heard it lately, "President Grant is not the right man." There 
are a number of men today, and always will be, who feel in their 
hearts that they ought to lead the Church, that they ought to be 
chosen apostles. The woods are full of them every time there is a 
vacancy. This same class of men feel that the Church itself is out 
of gear and going wrong. President Woodruff made this broad re- 
mark.] "I say to all Israel ; I say it to the whole world, that the God 
of Israel, who organized this Church and Kingdom, never ordained 
any president or presidency to lead the Church astray." I am glad 
of that, so that we need not worry about the Church. God knows we 
have enough other things to worry about. Go home and go to sleep ; 
God will never allow them to lead us astray. 

The question has been asked many times [now I have heard this 
until I am tired and lame all up the back], "Why is it the apostles who 
are standing as prophets, seers, and revelators do not have revelations?" 
The answer is given by President Woodruff, and I would like to have 
this truth soak into you. The answer is given by President Woodruff 
as follows : "I hold in my hand a book of revelations" [meaning the 
Doctrine and Covenants], "which contains enough revelations to lead 
this Church into the celestial kingdom of God." [That is about as far 
as some of us will ever get !] "Anybody who will obey and live 
up to these revelations can be saved in the celestial glory." [There 
are hundreds in this crowd, and you can count me in with them, who do 
not even keep the Ten Commandments, and then we are hunting for 
more revelations.] "We are not without revelations," says President 



ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL 



173 



Woodruff, "the heavens are full of them, and so is the holy Priest- 
hood. You will conclude that I do not believe in any more revelation. 
If you had before you every revelation God ever gave to man, the 
Church and Kingdom of God could not progress and advance with- 
out the living oracles of God." Do not forget that, I do not care how 
much revelations you have ; the living oracles of God have got to have 
revelation and inspiration and prophecy from above. 

The First Presidency, the Twelve Apostles, the Seventies, the 
High Priests, the Bishops, all need revelation in all their administra- 
tions. What can a Bishop do without revelation ? What can the presi- 
dent of a mission do? What can an elder do? Haven't I heard the 
voice? Haven't I been a stranger in a strange land? Haven't I been 
tired and hungry, no place to lay my head, and I have heard the voice, 
"this is the way, walk ye in it." The Holy Spirit softened the hearts 
of the people, and they fed me and cared for me. I have heard the 
voice more than once. I heard that voice when I was a young, wild, 
reckless young man. I did not know what it was. I told my brother 
Elias, "I hear a voice; it tells me something a hundred miles away." 
And I knew all about it before my mother knew it, and Elias thought 
I was going crazy — and so did I. But it was the right voice. I 
didn't know what it meant then, but I know what it means now. 

I am about through. You are the best outstanding crowd I ever 
talked to in my life. You know how it is ; we get people to talk to 
inside, and lock them in, so they can't get out ! I remember being up 
north. I said, "All you people that want to go, go ;" and they nearly all 
went, and I didn't blame them. 

"No man," says President Woodruff, "can be a witness for God 
and lift up his voice and declare that the gospel of Jesus Christ is true 
without revelation. The Holy Ghost, the Comforter, which is the 
spirit of prophecy and revelation, is not restricted and given only 
to 'apostles and prophets.' Do not forget it. It comes to- and goes 
with all Latter-day Saints, men, and women [thank God they get a 
little of it, too; they need it just as much as men do] men and women 
and children, who have accepted the gospel of Jesus Christ can have 
inspiration and revelation, for their own guidance." "Therefore, verily, 
thus saith the Lord, Let Zion rejoice, for this is Zion, the pure in 
heart. For behold and lo, vengeance cometh speedily, upon the un- 
godly, like a whirlwind, and who shall escape? Zion shall escape, if 
she observe to do all things whatsoever I have commanded you." 

God bless you. Amen. 

After singing by the choir, the benediction was pronounced by 
Elder B. S. Hinckley, counselor in the Presidency of the Liberty stake 
of Zion. 



CLOSING SESSION 



The Conference was continued in the Tabernacle on Sunday 
afternoon, October 8, 1922, at 2 o'clock. President Heber J. Grant 
presided. 

The choir and congregation sang, "The Spirit of God like a fire 
is burning." 

Prayer was offered by Elder Soren Rasmussen, President of the 
Jordan stake of Zion. 

A solo by August Glissmeyer was rendered with the choir ac- 
companying, "The Lord hath brought again Zion," music by Arthur 
Shepherd, the words from the Doctrine and Covenants, arranged by 
Elder B. H. Roberts. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

When this great auditorium was built, we were a thousand miles 
from civilization; nails were worth a dollar a pound, therefore the 
building is mostly pinned together with wooden pins. 

Elder Junius F. Wells handed me a memorandum day before 
yesterday and I have had it copied, and I am sure it will be of interest 
to all of. the people here assembled: 

THE FIRST CONFERENCE IN THE GREAT TABERNACLE 

"Fifty-five years ago today, October 6, 1867, the first General 
Conference ever held in this building convened, on Sunday morning 
at 10 o'clock. 

"The building was incomplete — there was no gallery. The gallery 
was added in 1870; improvised seats; the organ was partly built, 700 
pipes, and it was announced that when finished there would be 2000 
pipes. Joseph J. Daynes played upon it. Choir was led by Robert 
Sands. The choirs of Springville, Payson and Spanish Fork attended — 
Elder Fishburn conductor. Croxall's Brass Band, Eardley's Ogden 
Band and the Nephi Brass Band attended. A hymn by Eliza R. Snow 
composed for the occasion was sung. Solos were sung by W. C. Dun- 
bar and J. T. D. McAllister. 

"The General Authorities were: First Presidency: Brigham Young, 
Heber C. Kimball and Daniel H. Wells. Quorum of the Twelve 
Apostles : Orson Hyde, Orson Pratt, Sen., John Taylor, Wilford Wood- 
ruff, George A. Smith, Ezra T. Benson, Charles C. Rich, Lorenzo 
Snow, Erastus Snow, Franklin D. Richards, George Q. Cannon and 
Joseph F. Smith. (All present but F. D. Richards presiding in the 
European Mission.) Patriarch: John Smith. First Seven Presidents 
of Seventies : Joseph Young, Levi W. Hancock, Henry Harriman, Al- 
bert P. Rockwood, Horace S. Eldredge, Jacob Gates and John Van 
Cott. Presiding Bishopric: Edward Hunter, Leonard W. Hardy and 
Jesse C. Little. Reporters: George D. Watt, David W. Evans, Edward 
L. Sloan, Clerk of the Conference.

"Of the General Authorities sustained that day all died in the faith. 
(Four of the Twelve became Presidents and three Counselors in the 
First Presidency.) Neither before this period nor for thirty years 
afterwards could this be said. The Church then numbered less than 
120,000. It has increased three-fold if not four in the fifty-five years. 

SUBJECTS AND REMARKS BY THE SPEAKERS 55 YEARS AGO 

"President Young congratulated the workmen and the people on 
the good work done towards completing the building and gave out a 
number of texts for the brethren to preach upon : The Perpetual Emi- 
gration Fund ; Education of Children in the Ways of the Lord ; and of 
Young Women in Business, so that they could be profitably employed 
in Light Labor, such as Bookkeeping and Store Work ; On Raising 
Five Hundred Teams to Haul Rock for the Temple; On the South- 
ern Mission; On Temperance in Eating and Drinking; and the Word 
of Wisdom. 

"Elder Orson Hyde said : 'This is the largest congregation I ever 
addressed and the largest assembly of religious worshipers I have ever 
seen together.' The house was filled to overflowing. He testified that 
at a meeting in Iowa, in 1848, the Lord revealed to the Twelve Apos- 
tles and others that Brigham Young should be their leader. 

"Elder Orson Pratt remarked upon how the great tabernacle ap- 
peared towering above other buildings like an artificial mountain — - 
"the Mountain of the Lord's House in the tops of the mountains," as 
he came down Parley's Canyon, returning from his late mission to 
Europe. He delivered a powerful discourse on the personality of 
God, and touched on the resurrection. 

"President Young said he did not know how the resurrection 
would be but supposed he knew as much about it as any one. 'No 
man can explain it except he has received the keys of it by revela- 
tion.' He said that we should preserve our personality and that the 
essential parts of our bodies endure forever. 

"Elder John Taylor spoke upon the supremacy and superiority 
of the laws and government of God over the governments of men, 
and of the comprehensiveness of the gospel, comparing savage and 
civilized peoples. 

"Elder Wilford Woodruff spoke of the wonderful providence of 
God in the growth of the people, in means and members, and advised 
the young people to marry and lay the foundation for homes and 
happiness. 

"Elder George A. Smith advocated home manufactures, recom- 
mending the use and economy of wooden-soled shoes and urged the 
people to emigrate the poor. 

"President Brigham Young delivered a wonderful sermon on the 
Word of Wisdom. He said : 'It is wisdom for us not to drink liquor, 
tea and coffee, and to let tobacco alone.' If there are any cases when 
a cup of tea or a little tobacco will do good he would not object to 
their being taken ; but who is to be the judge of, when they will do

good? He was satisfied that when the least lenity is given, there 
would be a disposition to treat resolution. Some seem to think that 
this counsel will soon die away and that the people will return to the 
use of tea, coffee, tobacco and liquor. He would say that if any of 
the Elders of Israel should treat this counsel lightly he would promise 
them the curse of God would be upon them. It is required of the 
Latter-day Saints that they keep the Word of Wisdom and if they 
trifle with it they will be sorry for it. He spoke briefly several times 
during the conference. He offered the opening prayer and he made 
the benediction. 

"Elder Ezra T. Benson spoke on home industries, and referred to 
the good effect of President Young's recent trip in the North. 

"Elder Charles C. Rich spoke briefly on home industries and 
upon the unity of the Saints, saying there never had been a time when 
they were more united than at the present. 

"Elder Lorenzo Snow spoke on education and preaching the gos- 
pel, warning the nations of the judgments and calamities coming. He 
illustrated his theme by reciting the dreams of Joseph and their ful- 
filment in Egypt. 

"Elder Erastus Snow spoke prophetically of the South country 
saying there were elements of great worth there, which in time, would 
justify the wisdom of colonizing that country. About one hundred and 
fifty young men were called to go south and live, and strengthen the 
settlements there. This was the 'Muddy Mission.' The names were 
called out by Elder George Q. Cannon, who also presented the Gen- 
eral Authorities sustained as above. He spoke on education, and of 
the regeneration of a people through observing the Word of Wisdom. 
He also laid before the audience the plan of the Sunday School Union 
soon to be organized. 

"Elder Joseph F. Smith was called into the Twelve to fill the ex- 
isting vacancy. He delivered an interesting discourse on individual 
duty and obligations and advised all foreign born Saints to learn to 
speak the English language. He said : 'Our mission i s jo work right- 
eousness and to bring all things subservient to the will of God.' 

"President Young paid Brother Joseph F. Smith a remarkable 
tribute, and commented upon the honors, rights and privileges of every 
man holding an office in the Priesthood. 'No man succeeds to the 
crown or honors of another; each secures his own by his faithfulness 
and his deserts.' 

"On Tuesday, October 8, the President said there were things 
he would like to teach the people that would keep them together con- 
tinuously, but it was not prudent to hold them too long. A vote was 
then taken to decide whether to adjourn conference for six months or 
to continue it over another day. The vote was to continue, and so the 
fourth day, Wednesday, October 9, meetings were held all day. The 
emigration of Saints from Europe was stressed by all the speakers. 

A REMARKABLE GATHERING 

"This was a remarkable conference. There were no railroads here

then, no street cars, no paved streets, no sewers, electric or gas lights, 
no telephones, automobiles or radiographs, nor three story buildings 
in Utah. There were no High Schools, Improvement Associations or 
Primaries. The University had but a nominal existence. The in- 
structions were nevertheless to preach the gospel of Christ ; emigrate 
t he poor ; build up Zion substantially ; educate the children ; cultivate 
the land ; produce our own wares, food and fabrics ; set our own fash- 
ions ; be kind to families, charitable to all people, clean, refined, vir- 
tuous, lovers of God, obedient to his counsels, and loyal to country 
and one another." 

I felt sure that this audience would be pleased to hear what 
transpired in that conference! fifty-five years ago — before I was eleven 
years old. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 
(Introducing Mr. J. R. Howard) 

We have the honor of having present with us today, President 
J. R. Howard, of the Farm Bureaus of the United States of America, 
and he has consented to address us. He will be the next speaker. 

MR. J. R. HOWARD 

{President of the U. S. Farm Bureaus) 

I deem it a very great privilege, as well as a favor, to stand before 
you and acknowledge before you my belief in God, and in his Son, 
and in the guidance of his Holy Spirit. 

I come from a farming community. Agriculture is my business. 
My neighbors, as well as myself, belong to the common people of 
America, and I am glad to know that in this audience, and in this 
splendid inter-mountain empire, there are many of my own kind of 
folk. 

I am sure you will agree with me that the measure of strength of 
any church or any government or any school, is that of the average 
individual. The purpose of us all, in our work, is to raise the level of 
the average, rather than to create an aristrocracy of wealth or of in- 
tellect. We are going through trying and troublous times, as a peo- 
ple. I am convinced that there is but one thing that is going to re- 
store normalcy in this world, and that is the advancement of the re- 
ligion of Christ. We will not get back to the place where we can 
further make progress, except we are anchored on things eternal. 

On my farm, as I go to my work, and look at my crops, I love to 
see, in their growth, the work of a divine hand. I never travel or 
cross the mountains but what I think of the eternal God which made 
those hills. But we, as a people, need to recognize God, not alone as 
the God of the fields, of the flowers and the plants; not alone as the 
God of the mountains, but we must recognize him as the God of the 
human heart. So, I am glad to bring you this greeting, and to tell 



178 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



you that the spirituality of this session and the session of this morning 
are as a sweet incense upon my soul. 

I often think of a patriarch and prophet of old, who returned to 
his country after it had been devastated by enemies. He found the 
walls of the city down, and the temple destroyed. He set about, with 
a brave heart, to rebuild the walls of that city, but the enemies on 
the plains beset him and hindered him and harassed him, but the brave 
old man worked on, regardless of the enemy. Finally, the last gate 
of the wall was almost completed, and the enemy, in order to distract 
him from his work sent a delegation to him saying, "Come down to 
one of the cities of the plains and let us talk this thing over." I want 
to bring you his reply today, and to say to you that I hope that your 
lives are so adjusted, whether you be farmer or merchant, manufac- 
turer, laborer, school-teacher or housewife, whether your position be 
high or lowly ; I hope that his reply will be your reply, as it is mine. I 
imagine I can see the flash in the old man's eye and the straightening 
of his shoulders, as he said to those who sought to distract him from 
his noble work, and get him to come down to the city of the plains. 
These were his words: "I am doing a great work. I cannot come 
down." 

May those be your words, and may He who rules over the destinies 
of men and nations continue with you and all of us in your good work.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAWSON 

My brethren arid sisters : There is a large clock in the other end 
of this building, that is greatly illuminated. It is placed there for 
the benefit and help of the speakers. When I am sitting on my seat 
I can see the time clearly, but when I arise to' speak in this great 
building, in the midst of this great congregation, I regret to say I go 
blind and cannot see the time (laughter). 

I wish to commend and to congratulate Professor Lund and the 
Tabernacle choir, and the young lady soloist, for the anthem that was 
sung at the closing meeting this morning. It was magnificently done. 
The young lady has a wonderful voice. It went up and up to such a 
high note that T thought for a moment the drum of my ear was 
shattered, but it was not ; and then she went up and up and up until 
it seemed to me that she stood on the edge of a precipice and would 
surely go over, but she did not. It was a wonderful performance, 
and the anthem this afternoon also was grand, impressive and beau- 
tifully rendered. 

Day before yesterday, I was proud and high-minded and lifted up 
in my feelings. Through some strange accident, I got hold of the hat 
of President Penrose and wore it all the afternoon. I am free to con- 
fess that I could not' fill his shoes, but I filled his hat (laughter). 

VIOLATION OF MORAL LAW A FATAL AND DEADLY SIN 

The President in the opening meeting gave the keynote to the 
conference by counseling obedience to law ; obedience to divine law, 
and obedience to the law of the land. The divine law is always a right- 
eous law and needs no repealing. The law of man generally, and in 
the main, is a righteous one. Sometimes the laws of man are not 
righteous, therefore when they are not righteous they ought to be 
repealed. Most of the speakers of the conference have touched upon 
this vital question from various angles. It would be well perhaps 
to treat it for a few moments from still another angle. Let me say, 
I feel that I am justified in saying, that there is no future for any 
nation that despises virtue, and continuously and persistently violates 
the moral law. This is a fatal and deadly sin. Whenever the cup 
of their iniquity is full, such nation or nations will be overthrown and 
suffer the displeasure of an offended God. This assertion, brethren 
and sisters, is attested by many examples of sacred as well as profane 
history. 

AN EXAMPLE FROM PROFANE HISTORY 

For instance, take Rome. One of the greatest and most powerful 
empires of the ancient world was the Roman Empire. It had in it 
the strength of iron to bruise, to crush and to break in pieces. It 
conquered many nations and kingdoms and brought them into subjec- 
tion. The fear of Rome extended to all the known world of that 
day, and to be called a Roman citizen was regarded as a great dis- 



PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAW SON 



181 



tinction. In the early days and years of Rome, as I have said, she was 
strong, she was invincible but in later years through yielding to the 
subtle influence of luxurious living and the violation of the moral law, 
she became weak, and was finally broken to pieces. A French editor, 
M. Guizot, gives us a short, vivid picture of the decline and fall of 
Rome, in the preface of Gibbon's Rome. This is what he said: 

"The gradual decline of the most extraordinary dominion which has 
ever invaded and oppressed the wor'd ; the fall of that immense empire, 
erected on the ruins of so many kingdoms, republics and states, both bar- 
barous and civi'ized, and forming in its turn, by its dismemberment, a mul- 
titude of States, republics and kingdoms; the annihilation of the religion 
of Greece and Rome; the birth and the progress of the two new religions 
which have shared the most beautiful regions of the earth; the decrepitude 
of the ancient world, the spectacle of its expiring glory and degenerate 
manners * * * such a subject must necessarily fix the attention and 
excite the interest of men, who cannot behold with indifference those mem- 
orable epochs." 

Other examples in profane history might be given. 

ILLUSTRATIONS FROM SACRED SCRIPTURE 

Let us turn for a few moments to sacred history : In the early 
years of the world the people became very wicked. Noah, a prophet 
and a righteous man, preached to them one hundred twenty years and 
pleaded with the people to repent of their sins and to forsake them, 
but to no avail. They were guilty of every kind and species of wicked- 
ness, and "God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth 
and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil 
continually." And again the record says: "God looked upon the earth 
and beheld it was corrupt, for all flesh had corrupted his way upon 
the earth." It was then, God decreed that all flesh should be de- 
stroyed. He sent the flood, and the children of men were submerged, 
only Noah and his family escaping. 

The Lord brought the children of Israel up out of Egypt and out 
of bondage with power and an outstretched arm. He brought them 
into the wilderness, he brought them to Mount Sinai, and there, with 
a demonstration of his power and might in the midst of thunders and 
lightnings, gave to them the moral law. It was bound up in the Ten 
Commandments — "Thou shalt not commit adultery." This law was 
strictly enforced among the children of Israel, and its violation was 
attended by severe penalties, and thus — mark you, brethren and sis- 
ters, were they measurably protected from that great sin. Finally 
the children of Israel were brought to the land of Canaan. Palestine, 
the land that was given by promise to Abraham and his seed, was 
inhabited by six or seven great nations, and the Lord commanded his 
people to go in and drive out those nations, to destroy them and to 
take possession of the land. This is what he said, if they would indeed 
obey his voice: "I will be an enemy unto thine enemies," I will be 
an adversary unto thine adversaries, for mine Angel shall go before 



182 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



thee, and bring thee in unto the Amorites, and the Hittites, and the 
Perizzites, and the Canaanites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites ; and 1 
will cut them off. Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor 
serve them, nor do after the ; r works ; but thou shalt utterly overthrow 
them, and quite break down their images." 

It may be said by some, that God in this matter' was cruel, that 
he was unmerciful, that this was a vengeful thing to do, but you must 
remember that the people in Canaan were steeped in wickedness, were 
guilty of every species of crime, were engaged in idolatry, and were 
violators of the moral law. Their cup of iniquity was full, they were 
ripe for destruction, and destruction came. 

And the children of Israel went into the Promised Land and in 
those early years they were prospered and strengthened and upheld by 
the power of their Maker. Oh, what a blessed people! He smiled 
upon them and they also had prophets to minister to them in the things 
of God. But in later years, when they forsook the worship of God 
and turned to idolatry and ceased to observe the moral law, great 
distress and trial came upon them, and they were visited by great de- 
struction. 

.MORAL LAW EMPHASIZED IN THE MINISTRY OF JESUS 

In the meridian of time John the Baptist came in the wilderness 
preaching the gospel, the gospel of repentance, and Jerusalem and all 
Judea came to his baptism and when John perceived the wickedness 
and hypocrisy of the Pharisees, he said to them : "O generation of 
vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come? "Bring 
forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance." 

Jesus came later preaching the gospel and counseled the people 
to repent and receive it. It seems to me that the moral law was 
greatly emphasized in the incident of the woman who was taken in 
transgression. She was brought to Christ by the Pharisees who 
charged her with the crime of adultery, and they stood there before 
him impatiently. They were urgent for his condemnation upon the 
woman that they might take her out and stone her to death. Christ 
looked upon them intently, and then he knelt down and with his 
finger wrote in the sand then stood up again. The Pharisees were 
still urgent for his action, but he, perceiving the wickedness of their 
hearts, said: "He that is without sin let him cast the first stone." He 
again knelt and wrote in the sand, and then he stood up once more 
and looking around said to the woman : "Woman, where are thine 
accusers ? Is* there no man to condemn thee ?" And the woman said : 
"Lord there is no man to condemn me." Now, you remember his 
sublime answer, brethren and sisters : 

"Neither do I condemn thee. Go thy way and sin no more." 
But, mark this, he did not apologize for her sin, he did not excuse her, 
he did not condone the sin, but said : "Go thy way and sin no more." 
I think this is a wonderful example of God's mercy and also of God's 
justice, quite beyond us.

PAUL S ANALYSIS 

Paul the Apostle in his epistle to the Corinthians went deeper into 
the matter when he said : "Know ye not that ye are the temple of 
God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? If any man defile 
the temple of God, him shall God destroy: for the temple of God is 
holy, which temple ye are." 

Oh, how sublime ! It is logical, it is philosophical, it is reasonable. 
We are the children of God, and he designates his children as temples, 
living temples of God. It is wonderful, it is beautiful! There are 
temples of wood and stone, but these are living temples. 

Paul's interpretation amplified by the prophet joseph smith 

Now, brethren and sisters, we are of the children of Israel, and 
the great moral law that was made binding upon them is also equally 
binding upon us. It has been renewed to us in our day, and the lan- 
guage of Paul has been amplified, greatly enlarged, by a modern rev- 
elation. You will find it in Section 93, Doc. and Cov., where these 
wonderful words are recorded : "For man is spirit. The elements 
are eternal, and spirit and element, inseparably connected, receiveth 
a fulness of joy. And when separated, man cannot receive a fulness 
of joy. The elements are the tabernacle of God; yea, man is the 
tabernacle of God, even temples ; and whatsoever temple is defiled, 
God shall destroy that temple." 

IF MAN IS IMMORAL HE IS WEAK AS WATER 

So we are now under that great and important law. It is vital 
to our welfare, to our salvation. Go out upon the street. You may 
see a man standing there. He is wonderfully well developed, strong 
physically, strong' mentally. Why, he may have been through college, 
a graduate. Oh, how well equipped he is for life ! But I tell you, 
brethren and sisters, if that man is immoral he is as weak as water. 
Another man who is famous throughout the land as a lawyer, who 
can command his thousands and thousands of dollars, his knowledge 
is so desirable. But I tell you that if that man is immoral he is as 
weak as water. And still another man may have studied medicine and 
attained to great eminence. You may envy him. I tell you if he is 
immoral he is as weak as water. And take a young woman who has 
had every advantage of education and culture. She is accomplished, 
she can play the piano most beautifully, she may be a great writer, but 
I Tell you, if that young woman is immoral she is as weak as water; 
because, remember, that the Spirit of God will not dwell in unholy 
temples. If I can leave that impression with you this afternoon, breth- 
ren and sisters, oh, how thankful I shall be. 

I rejoice in the gospel of Jesus Christ. I know it is true. I do 
know that Jesus is the Christ and that Joseph Smith was and is his 
prophet, and that he stands at the head of this last dispensation. He 
was indeed a wonderful man, and, I apprehend, was a great spirit

in the spirit world before he came to this earth. I rejoice in this 
testimony, and I bear it to you in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The trio, "Lift Thine Eyes,"' was sung by Lola Leonard, Louise 
Watson, and Edna Gothberg. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

There has never been, within my recollection, anything to com- 
pare with the wonderful outpouring of people, to our semi-annual 
conferences, such as we have had during the past three days. 

CONSIDERING A FOUR-DAYS CONFERENCE 

I think that, perhaps, in the future it may be well— and we will 
seriously consider it — to have four days of conference. Several of our 
speakers limited themselves to sixteen, seventeen, and eighteen min- 
utes, and, as you know, only two of the seven presidents of seventies 
have had the opportunity of addressing the vast congregations that 
have appeared in this building, and only one of the presiding bishopric. 
The suggestion made fifty-five years ago and carried by a vote of 
the people, that they continue the Conference for another day, if car- 
ried out at our next meeting, in six months from now, would, in all 
probability, give each of the brethren of the general authorities, and 
some of our mission presidents, an opportunity to express themselves 
without feeling very much limited for time. I am not sure but that 
the addresses of the three or four of our brethren, including the ad- 
dresses of the presidency, that were beyond the short limit of fifteen 
to twenty odd minutes, gave the brethren who delivered them greater 
liberty of utterance, and a freer flow of the Spirit, than was enjoyed 
by those I had to request to make their addresses short. It is only fair 
to say that a great many of the Latter-day Saints have expressed to 
me, time and time again, the idea that if we cannot all find the time 
to bear our testimonies and deliver our messages at a general confer- 
ence, it would be better to only have a number of us talk at one of the 
conferences, and the balance at the next one. But, I have felt in my 
heart an anxiety that each of those who are presiding over our mis- 
sions throughout the United States, and each of the general author- 
ities of the Church whom you have voted to sustain here this day — 
the twenty-six members that stand as the presiding authority in the 
Priesthood — -should lift up their voices in each and all of our con- 
ferences and bear witness of the goodness of God to them. For that 
reason we have always had them speak, and occasionally we have heard 
from some others in addition. I have heard a great many people say 
that one cannot very well deliver much of a sermon in ten minutes, 
but some of the very choicest of all the choice sermons that I have 
ever heard in this building, have been delivered in five and ten min- 
utes. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT

EXPRESSED THANKS TO ALL WHO HAVE TAKEN PART 

■ When I think of the scores and scores of conferences I have 
attended in October, through driving storms and snow, to say noth- 
ing about the cold and the blizzardy weather we have had, I have re- 
joiced and been thankful to the Lord for the very wonderful and 
splendid weather we have enjoyed during this conference. I extend 
to the Saints my thanks and my blessing for the wonderful outpouring 
of the people at these conference meetings. I am grateful to our 
choir and to all who have taken part in rendering to us the very 
splendid music that we have enjoyed during our conference. I am 
thankful to each and all of the speakers who have spoken here in 
this building, and to those who have spoken in the overflow meetings. 
I feel that the Lord has abundantly blessed us, and poured out his 
spirit upon us, and that we will go from this meeting refreshed in 
spirit, renewed in our determinations to serve him and keep his com- 
mandments, and to proclaim the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ by 
the uprightness, the honesty, the integrity and the devotion of our 
lives. 

THEY ARE THE GREATEST SPEAKERS WHO LIVE THE GOSPEL 

The Latter-day Saints, as a people, have the greatest number of 
preachers in all the world, for the reason that nearly every lay member 
has been on one or more missions of from two to five years, proclaim- 
ing the gospel, without money and without price. We are a nation — 
small nation, so to speak — of preachers, but the greatest and the most 
wonderful preacher among the Latter-day Saints is the man or the 
woman who lives the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. "Show me thy 
faith by thy works" is the thing that counts. James said that he 
would show his faith by his works, and that faith without works is 
dead. It is like the body without the spirit, and you know that needs 
to be buried very soon after the spirit departs, or it becomes obnoxious. 
It is by our works, our diligence, our faithfulness, our energy, that 
we can preach this gospel, and the people of the world are beginning 
to recognize, to know and to comprehend the fact that the fruits of 
the gospel of Jesus Christ, as taught by the Latter-day Sains, are good 
fruits. To have the lowest death rate, to have the highest birth rate, 
to have Utah tie — (nearly twenty years ago, when I was in England, 
presiding over the European Mission) for second place among the 
states of America, for literacy — only one state ahead of us — show that 
we are making a record that we can well be proud of. I have said 
to people, in my travels as a member of the Council of the Twelve, dur- 
ing the past forty years, that all we ask any man or of any woman, at 
home or abroad, that they do for the Latter-day Saints, is to judge 
them by their fruits. The one great standard laid down by the Savior 
of the world was, "By their fruits ye shall know them." For happi- 
ness in their homes, for contentment, prosperity, business integrity, 
sobriety, for observance of the laws of God and of man, I am at the

defiance of the world to find any other people superior to the Latter- 
day Saints. I am not speaking now of "Mormons" who do not keep 
the commandments of God. 

THE STANDARDS BY WHICH WE WISH TO BE JUDGED 

No true Americans desire to be judged by the Benedict Arnolds 
of our country, but they desire to be judged by men like George Wash- 
ington and Abraham Lincoln and others who have been devoted to the 
principles upon which this country stands and to the Constitution of 
our country, who respect that Constitution, who stand for the obey- 
ing of the laws of the country, and who have given their lives, or 
offered their lives, for the country. Those are the people whose lives 
we desire shall be the standard by which the United States of America 
shall be judged — not by the law-breakers. We desire that the Lat- 
ter-day Saints shall be judged by those who keep the commandments 
of the Lord, who obey the word of wisdom, who obey the command- 
ment to give to the Lord one-tenth of all that shall come into their 
hands, who attend to their family and their secret prayers, who are 
ready and willing to go, without money and without price, to the utter- 
most ends of the earth to proclaim the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, 
and who do it under the inspiration of the' Spirit of the living God. 

A PROMINENT EXAMPLE 

We desire to be judged by men, for instance, like Col. R. M. 
Bryce Thomas, who came to Salt Lake City about thirty years ago, a 
retired Colonel in the British Army. His wife was taken sick and 
they were stopping in what was then known as the Templeton hotel, 
and, across the road from that hotel was the headquarters, then, of the 
Deseret News. Over the front door was a sign " 'Mormon' publica- 
tions for sale." Day after day he read this sign, until it got on his 
nerves, so he went and bought a lot of "Mormon" publications, and he 
read and studied them. When he returned to London, he attended our 
meetings, and later joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints. He made twoi trips all the way from London to Salt Lake, to 
perform ordinances for his dead ancestors, in the temple of the living 
God, on this block. He wrote a long letter — I imagine fully a hun- 
dred, if not more, pages, telling his friends why he had joined the 
Church of Jesus Christ. It is entitled My Reasons for Leaving the 
Church of England and Joining the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints. This was written for the express purpose of enlightening 
his friends. He received so many letters asking him why he had 
joined this unpopular people, that it kept him constantly busy and so he 
decided to publish his reasons, with no idea that his pamphlet, or the 
letter that he sent to Liverpool to have published for his benefit, would 
be used as a tract. We ask to be judged by men like Colonel Thomas. 

It has been said, and I believe truthfully, that about the tenderest 
part of the human anatomy, of the male variety of the species, is the 
pocket, and Colonel Thomas, from the day that he was baptized sends

once a month to the London office a fast-day offering; once a month 
a check comes for one-tenth of his compensation as a retired Colonel 
in the British army. 

THE JOY OF CONVERTING SOULS AND PROCLAIMING THE GOSPEL ' 

We ask to be judged by those men who are giving their all — 
their talents and their lives — and those women who are doing the same, 
for the advancement of God's kingdom, by those who feel a desire in 
their hearts to proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ, that feel exactly 
as did Alma of old, when he said (Alma 29) : 

"O that I were an angel, and could have the wish of mine heart, that 
I might go forth and speak with the trump of God, with a voice to shake 
the earth, and cry repentance unto every people ! 

Yea, I would declare unto every soul, as with the voice of thunder, 
repentance and the plan of redemption, that they should repent and come 
unto our God, that there might not be more sorrow upon all the face of 
the earth. 

"But behold, I am a man, and do sin in my wish; for I ought to be con- 
tent with the things which the Lord hath allotted unto me. 

"I ought not to harrow up in my desires, the firm decree of a just God, 
for I know that he granteth unto men according to their desire, whether 
it be unto death or unto life; yea, I know that he allotteth unto men, ac- 
cording to their wills, whether they be unto salvation or unto destruction. 

"Yea, and I know that good and evil have come before all men ; or he that 
knoweth not good from evil is blameless; but he that knoweth good and 
evil, to him it is given according to his desires; whether he desireth good 
or evil, life or death, joy or remorse of conscience. 

"Now, seeing that I know these things, why should I desire more than 
to perform the work to which I have been called? 

"Why should I desire that I were an angel, that I could speak unto all 
the ends of the earth? 

"For behold, the Lord doth grant unto all nations, of their own nation 
and tongue, to teach his word, yea, in wisdom, all that he seeth fit that 
they should have; therefore we see that the Lord doth counsel in wisdom, 
according to that which is just and true. 

"I know that which the Lord hath commanded me, and T glory in it. 
I do not gloryi of myself, but I glory in that which the Lord hath com- 
manded niie; yea, and this is my glory, that perhaps I may be an instrument 
in the hands of God to bring some soul to repentance; and this is my 
joy. 

"And behold, when I see many of my brethren truly penitent, and 
coming to the Lord their God, then is my soul filled with joy; then do I 
remember what the Lord has done for me, yea, even that he hath heard 
my prayer; yea, then do I remember his merciful arm which he extended 
towards me. 

"Yea, and I also remember the captivity of my fathers; for I surely do 
know that the Lord did deliver them out of bondage, and by this did estab- 
lish his church; yea, the Lord God, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac,, 
and the God of Jacob, did deliver them out of bondage. 

"Yea, I have always remembered the captivity of my fathers; and 
that same God who delivered them out of the hands of the Egyptians did 
deliver them out of bondage. 

"Yea, and that same God did establish his church among them; yea and 
that same God hath called me by a holy calling, to preach the word unto 
this people and hath given me. much success, in the which my joy is full." 

There is no living soul in all the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-

day Saints, who has gone forth to proclaim this gospel, from the mid- 
night sun country of Scandinavia, where the mother of Reed Smoot 
heard the gospel, down; to South Africa; from Canada to South 
America, but who like Alma of old has had that same joy and that 
same happiness, when he or she has been an instrument in the hands 
of God of bringing some soul to a knowledge of the divinity of the work 
in which you and I are engaged. 

"But I do not joy in my own success alone, but my joy is more full 
because of the success of my brethren, who have been up to the land of 
Nephi. 

"Behold, they have labored exceedingly, and have brought forth much 
fruit; and how great shall be their reward! 

"Now, when i think of the success of these my brethren my soul is 
carried away, even to the separation of it from the body, as it were, so 
great is my joy. 

"And now may God grant unto these, my brethren, that they may sit 
dbwn in the kingdom of God; yea, and also all those who are the fruit of 
their labors that they may go no more out, but that they, may praise him 
for ever. And may God grant that it may be done according to my words, 
even aa I have spoken. Amen." 

1 know of no joy on earth that can compare with that which 
comes to the heart of the man who is an instrument in the hands of 
God of saving some soul and turning it from that broad way that 
leadeth to destruction, into that straight and narrow path that leadeth 
to life eternal. 

AN ILLUSTRATION IN TLIE CONVERSION OF THE SPEAKER'S BROTHER 

As I stand here today, I remember what to me was the greatest 
of all the great incidents in my life, in this tabernacle. I saw for the 
first time, in the audience, my brother who had been careless, indif- 
ferent and wayward, who had evinced no interest in the gospel of 
Jesus Christ, and, as I saw him for the first time in this building, and 
as I realized that he was seeking God for light and knowledge re- 
garding the divinity of this work, I bowed my head and I prayed God 
that if I were requested to address the audience, that the Lord would 
inspire me by the revelations of his Spirit, by that Holy Spirit in whom 
every true Latter-day Saint believes, that my brother would have to 
acknowledge to me that I had spoken beyond my natural ability, that 
I had been inspired of the Lord. I realized that if he made that con- 
fession, then 1 should be able to point out to him that God had given 
him a testimony of the divinity of this work. Brother Milton Ben- 
nion was sitting on the stand that day, and he had been asked to ad- 
dress the congregation. President Angus M. Cannon came to me and 
said, "Before you entered the building, Brother Grant, I had invited 
Brother Milton Bennion to speak, but he can come some other day." 

I said, "Let him speak." Brother Cannon said, "Well, I will ask 
him to speak briefly, and you will please follow him." 

Brother Bennion told of his visit around the world; among other 
things, of visiting the sepulchre of Jesus. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



189 



I took out of my pocket a book that I always carried, called a 
Ready Reference, and I laid it down on the stand in front of me, 
when I stood up to speak. It was opened at the passages that tell of 
the vicarious work for the dead, of the announcement that Jesus went 
and preached to the spirits in prison, and proclaimed the gospel of 
Jesus Christ to them. I intended to read about the baptism for the 
dead, and I intended to preach upon the fact that the Savior of the 
world had not only brought the gospel to every soul upon the earth, 
but that it reached back to all those who had died without a knowledge 
of it, or in their sins, that they would have the privilege of hearing it ; 
that, as I understood and had read in the Doctrine and Covenants, 
Jesus came into the world to be crucified for the world and to die for 
the sins of the world and that he saved all except only those who 
denied the Son after the Father had revealed him — those who> had 
lived and those who had died. 

I remember standing here feeling that that was perhaps the 
greatest of all the great themes that we as Latter-day Saints had to 
proclaim to the world. I laid the book down, opened at that page; I 
prayed for the inspiration of the Lord, and the faith of the Latter-day 
Saints, and I never thought of the book from that minute until I 
sat down, at the end of a thirty-minute address. I closed my remarks 
at 12 minutes after 3 o'clock, expecting that President George Q. 
Cannon would follow me. Brother Angus came to the upper stand, 
and said, "George, please occupy the balance of the time." 

He said, "No, I do not wish to speak," but Brother Angus re- 
fused to take "No" for an answer. 

Brother Cannon said, finally: "Alright, go take your seat, and 
I will say something," and he arose and said in substance: "There 
are times when the Lord Almighty inspires some speaker by the rev- 
elations of his Spirit, and he is so abundantly blessed by the inspira- 
tion of the living God that it is a mistake for anybody else to speak 
following him, and one of those occasions has been today, and I de- 
sire that this meeting be dismissed without further remarks," and he 
sat down. 

. " I devoted the thirty minutes of my, speech almost exclusively to a 
testimony of my knowledge that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, and 
to the wonderful and marvelous labors of the Prophet Joseph Smith, 
and bearing witness to the knowledge God had given me that Joseph 
was in very deed a prophet of the true and living God. 

The next morning my brother came into my office and said, 
"Heber, I was at meeting yesterday and heard you preach." 

I said, "The first time you ever heard your brother preach, I 
guess?" 

"Oh, no," he said, "I have heard you lots of times." 
I said, "I never saw you in meeting before." 
"No," he said, "I generally come in late and go into the gallery. 
I often go out before the meeting is over. But you never spoke as 



190 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



you did yesterday. You spoke beyond your natural ability. You were 
inspired of the Lord." The identical words I had uttered the day 
before, in my prayer to the Lord. 

When I heard George Q. Cannon, after I sat down, and before 
his brother spoke to him, say to himself, "Thank God for the power 
of that testimony," the tears gushed from my eyes like rain and I 
rested my elbows on my knees and put my hands over my face, so that 
the people by me would not see that I was weeping like a child. I 
knew when I heard those words of George Q. Cannon, that God had 
heard and answered my prayer. I knew that my brother's heart was 
touched, and the next day when he came and repeated my words, I 
said to him, "Are you still praying for a testimony of the gospel'" 

He said, "Yes, and I am going nearly, wild." 

I asked, "What did I preach about yesterday?" 

He replied, "You know what you preached about." 

I said, "Well, you tell me." 

"You preached upon the divine mission of the Lroohet Joseph 
Smith." 

I answered, "And I was inspired beyond my natural ability; and 
I never spoke before — at any time you have heard me, as I spoke 
yesterday. Do you expect the Lord to get a club and knock you down ? 
What more testimony do you want of the gospel of Jesus Christ than 
that a man speaks beyond his natural ability and under the inspiration 
of God, when he testifies of the divine mission of the prophet Joseph ?" 
The next Sabbath he applied to me for baptism. 

If I were offered today, all the wealth of all the world, and had 
my brother in the condition he was in — without a knowledge of the 
divinity of this work, I know, as I know that I live, it would not be 
the slightest temptation to me. 

I do rejoice beyond all the power with which God has endowed 
me, in the divinity of this work in which we are engaged, and in the 
joy and the happiness that it brings to everyone of the Latter-day 
Saints who keeps the commandments of God. 

SARCASTIC ARGUMENTS AGAINST PROHIBITION 

I had here a lot of things I was going to read, and I have for- 
gotten about all of them but one. There is one thing I want to read 
and I want to call attention to the hypocrisy of a certain article in 
Judge, now combined with Leslie's Weekly. It is a contemptible and 
sarcastic sample, as we find here in an editorial in the Improvement 
Era, which says: 

"As a sample of the sarcastic and contemptible argument made by 
the anti-prohibitionists, Judge, which is a combination of the former 
Leslie's Weekly and the comic paper, Judge, has this editorial in a 
recent number : 

"light wines and beer 
"Volstead Prohibition has 
■ — smothered us in prosperity, 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



191 



— solved our labor problems. 

— diminished crimes of violence. 

— improved our morals. 

• — cut down our divorce rate. 

— produced greater respect for the law 

— discouraged corruption. 

— improved our foreign relations. 

— lessened the privileges of wealth. 

— increased our patriotism. 

— made us happier. 

"This list contains eleven lies. To make it an even dozen, we'll add that 
Judge is a prohibitionist." 

I lack language to express my contempt for any such an editorial 
as that in Judge, therefore I will not attempt to do it. The Lord has 
not given me the power. 

BABSON ON PROHIBITION 

I want to read something from the greatest statistician in America 
— Mr. Babson: 

"Another optimistic factor in our present business situation is national 
prohibition." 

Mr. Babson, I guess, is paid more money for what he writes 
than any other living man in the United States, even, I venture the 
assertion, about ten times as much as Judge with all the whisky money 
that they get for writing such stuff as I have read from Judge for you. 

"Before the Prohibition Act was passed, $3,000,000,000 were spent an- 
nually for drink." 

What is $3,000,000,000? Three dollars a minute for every minute 
until now, since the birth of the Savior of the world — three dollars a 
minute — three billion dollars, and no human being is benefited one 
particle by that $3,000,000,000 of expenditure, and hundreds and thou- 
sands and tens of thousands are ruined physically, morally and every 
other way, and many hundreds commit murder because of the liquor 
that they have. 

"Now, this $3,000',0O0,00O that was formerly spent for drink, goes to the 
buying of merchandise, the building of homes, the furnishing of homes and 
the starting of savings accounts. No matter what interpretation may be 
put on the law or what new legislation may be enacted, of this we are 
quite certain — that same $3,000,000,000 which formerly went to drink will 
hereafter be used for stimulating the regular channels of business. It will 
be used to buy merchandise, start savings accounts and do those things 
which tend to make people happy and prosperous." 

It will increase and has increased, in every land and in every 
clime, by a hundred to two or three hundred per cent, the amount of 
milk consumed, and milk is the best food that human beings can have. 

GETTING THE TOWEL DRY IN BUSINESS 

"As a successful merchant needs delivery wagons, so a successful na- 
tion needs a good merchant marine. Thanks to the war, the United States 
has such today. 



192 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



"Finally, w,e are today citizens of the richest country in the world. 
Where formerly we were a country owing the other nations of the world, 
we are today a credit country, with the rest of the world owing us. For 
this and other reasons, this country, fundamentally, is all right. Even at 
the present time, this medial line which represents fundamental conditions, 
is slowly but constantly going upward. 

"During 1917-19, however, [he is referring to the towel as representing 
business] the towel became saturated with water. This is just what hap- 
pened to business. The drops of water that fall off the towel when lifted 
out of the water may be indicative of orders for goods which fall to us 
during such inflated times. The saturated towel represents business when 
we were at the highest point in January, 1920, thoroughly saturated with 
water. Such saturation must be taken out. We must always get the 
towel dry again." 

ADVICE TO THE SAINTS TO GET OUT OF DEBT 

I say to the Latter-day Saints : Get the water out of your business 
at the earliest possible date ; get down to bed-rock. Remember the won- 
derful teachings of Joseph F. Smith from this stand, years ago, that 
would have saved hundreds and thousands of Latter-day Saints from 
ruin financially if they had listened to it. He said, "Get out of debt 
and keep out of debt." Cattle and sheep men, merchants, farmers and 
everybody, in the days of the boom, who got more land, more sheep, 
more cattle, more everything, by running into debt, would thank the 
Lord Almighty if they had only listened to President Joseph F. Smith. 

THE SECRET OF "MAKING GOOD" 

I want to read a little story. I do not think it will take me over 
five minutes, and then I am through. I read so much that I make 
people tired, but I do it in the hope they will read it again after it is 
published : 

"There were two boys named Brown; they were brothers. The mother 
had died with tuberculosis when the children were young. The father was 
a sea captain, one of the best of the town, but he was lost when these boys 
were fourteen and sixteen years of age, respectively. They, however, lived 
together in their three rooms, did thir own cooking and housework, and 
went to school. The people called them 'hatchet and handle' because they 
were always together. The older boy, Jimmie, finally went into a store, 
but the younger boy got that longing for the sea which only those brought 
up near the ocean can appreciate, and when sixteen j-ears old he w.ent out 
'on the banks' for a fishing trip. 

"The boy had been away only two weeks, when to that New England 
town came word that the vessel with all hands had gone down. The 
disaster was, of course, a great blow to the older brother, Jimmie — a ter- 
rible blow. It occurred in February or March. The spring came on; the 
birds returned. The summer followed; and again the trees changed their 
color in the autumn. Still Jimmie was very sad. In November a rumor 
came through the town that a great four-master schooner had gone on 
the rocks near the Point. The boys of the town, as always, went with the 
crowd to the Po:',nt to see the wreck. When they reached the shore, the 
life boat had alreadv gone out." 

"THE SPIRIT WHICH MAKES GOOD." 

And I want every Latter-day Saint to make good. 
"It was a wicked afternoon; that life boat would rise to the top of 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



193 



the waves and then go completely out of sight. Every one held his breath 
until it would come in sight again. Finally, the boat reached the ship, took 
off the crew, and came back to shore. As soon as it landed', the Life 
Savings men and the shipwrecked crew came stumbling out, falling ex- 
hausted on the beach. They were taken to a fire which had been built of 
driftwood, were given hot food and rubbed. They were gradually recover- 
ing when a rumor ran about the crowd that a chap, sick and helpless, had 
been left aboard 1 the ship; that because of his weak condition they could 
not get him into the life boat, since the waves were too severe, the sea 
running too high. Well, that didn't go with the people of that New Eng- 
land town and they urged the life boat crew to go back and save the other 
man. The crew replied : 'No, we cannot. It is too much to attempt again 
in these waves this afternoon.' 

"Then to the surprise of every one, little Jimmie Brown jumped up on 
a rock and shouted: 'I have nothing to live for. I have lost my brother. 
Let me go and I want some boys to go with me.' So the boys formed a 
volunteer crew, went out to the ship, and brought the other chap ashore. 
They also fell exhausted on the beach on their return. But they were 
rubbed and warmed; while the unconscious lad was taken to another fire 
to be nursed by the good women living near by. Finally, the unconscious 
one smiled and opened his eyes. Every one was happy. Gradually, one 
by one, the volunteer boy crew came up to the fire to look at this chap 
they had saved. Finally Jimmie Brown came and looked. Lo and behold, 
it was his younger brother! The crew of the fishing schooner had all been 
lost excepting this young Brown. He had been picked up by the four- 
master on its way to Manila, which, on its homeward voyage, was wrecked 
on the New England coast. 

"Young men and women who read this book: Remember Jimmie Brown. 
Forget yourselves. Think of the other fellow. Become interested in doing 
what is right; in standing for industry, integrity, service. If you do, you 
(like Jimmie Brown) will find what is dearest to your hearts, namely, 
PROSPERITY. The secret of making good is being good and doing 
good." 

No other people upon all the face of the earth have done as 
much good, have spent as much time/ have spent as much money in 
proclaiming the gospel and in living the gospel, by paying their 
tithes and their offerings and doing the things that God has com- 
manded, as have the Latter-day Saints. 

God bless you all. Amen. 

The choir sang, "Then shall your light break forth." 
Benediction was pronounced by President Charles W. Penrose. 

The Conference adjourned for six months. 

Professor Anthony C. Lund, assisted by B. Cecil Gates, con- 
ducted the singing in the Tabernacle. Professor J. J. McClellan 
played the accompaniments, interludes, etc. on the great organ, as- 
sisted by Professors E. P. Kimball and Tracy Y. Cannon. 

Stenographic reports of the discourses were made in the Taber- 
nacle by Franklin B. Otterstrom, assisted by Joseph Anderson; and 
in the Assembly Hall, by Frederick E. Barker ; and at the Bureau of 
Information, by Frederick G. Barker.:

Prophecies of Joseph Smith and Their Fulfillment

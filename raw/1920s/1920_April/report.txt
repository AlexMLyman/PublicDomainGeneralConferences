G E N E RA L CON FE RENCE 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

It is certainly an inspiring sight to see so many of the Latter- 
day Saints gathered here at the opening of onr conference. Consider- 
ing the weather I had expected that there would be no need this 
morning of having an overflow meeting in the Assembly Hall, but 
I was mistaken. 

I rejoice exceedingly in the faith that is in the hearts of the 
Latter-day Saints. I rejoice in the loyalty of the people to the Church 
of Jesus Christ, wherever they are located, from Canada on the 
north, to Mexico in the south, and in all the various missions through- 
out the world. I am convinced, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that 
there are no other people upon the face of the earth who are as de- 
voted to their religion, or who are ready and willing to and who do 
in very deed make as many sacrifices for their church, as an absolute 
practical demonstration of their faith, as do the Latter-day Saints. 

THE SAINTS ABSOLUTELY SINCERE. 

When we realize that thousands of Latter-day Saints who are 
absolutely honest in the payment of their tithes, who look upon the 
obligation to pay one-tenth of all they make as sacredly as they would 
look upon the obligation to divide with a partner, if that partner had 
a one-tenth interest in their business ; when we think of the dona- 
tions that are made for the support of the poor, for the erection of 
meetinghouses in the various wards, for the erection of stake taber- 
nacles, for the building erf academies, the construction of temples, and 
last, greatest of all, when we think of the wonderful sacrifice that 
is made by the men and women, giving two, three and five years of 
their time for missionary work, and some of them ten and fifteen 
years, at their own expense or the expense of their families, not only 
giving their time but paying their own way — I am sure that any per- 
son who stops to reflect upon these sacrifices must acknowledge that 
there can be no greater evidence of absolute sincerity and devotion 
given by any people to their faith and to the cause of God, as they 
understand it, than is given by the Latter-day Saints. 

DISPOSITION OF TITHING. 

I will read for your information some of the things that have 
been assisted by your tithing during the past year. The Saints them- 
selves have contributed $500,000, because it has been the custom 
for the Church to pay one-third only in the building of meeting- 
houses. During the latter part of the year, however, the Church 
has been doing one-half in the constructing of meetinghouses, 
and I would like to call attention to the fact that there are no ap- 
plications now made for assistance from the Trustee-in-Trust, but 
what the different wards and stakes ask for one-half of the 
money needed to erect their meetinghouses and their schoolhouses, 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT.

and there are applications on file now with the Trustee-in- 
Tmst for considerably above one million dollars. It is just as well 
for you to know that it is a financial impossibility for us to comply 
with all of those applications. Buildings cost today twice as much as 
they did a few years ago, so if a buiMing that would cost $30,000 
three or four years ago were erected now it would cost $60,000. In the 
past the Church has given ten thousand ; today it is asked for thirty 
thousand, which is an increase of two hundred per cent. We can not 
'possibly comply with all the requests, much as we would like to. 

There has been appropriated for maintenance of meetinghouses 
in the various wards during last year $254,108.59; for stake tabernacles, 
$35,811.82; appropriations to the various stakes, $167,410.96; for 
wards throughout the Church, $444,763.60; for hospitals, $70,121.00; 
for temple maintenance and construction, $214,476.51 ; for the various 
missions, $420,359.88 ; in addition to money contributed in these 
missions. Expended for charity, $354,283.26. For education, the 
Church gave $722,353.83, and the applications now for our schools 
amount to over one million for the coming year. We/ can not reach all 
that is required, but we will do as much as we possibly can. The total 
amount that has been expended in the various stakes, wards and mis- 
sions of the Church funds, for the year 1919 is $2,683,689.45. 

I am reminded of the fact that in two more days we will be cele- 
brating the 90th anniversary of the birth of the Church of Jesus Christ 
upon the earth in this last dispensation. Before the Church was 
organized there were a few people who believed in the vision that 
the prophet Joseph Smith had had as a boy, fourteen years of age. 
They also. believed that he had been visited by heavenly messengers, 
that he had had years of instruction, and they believed beyond the 
shadow of a doubt, that he had in his possession the golden plates 
from which he was translating the Book of Mormon. They believed 
in the many revelations that God gave to him and which he wrote 
out and delivered to the few with whom he was associated prior to 
the organization of the Church. One of those revelations was to 
the prophet's father — it is brief and I will read it — given a little more 
than a year before the organization of the Church. 

REVELATION TO THE PROPHET'S FATHER. 

Now behold, a marvelous work is about to come forth among the chil- 
dren of men; 

Therefore, O ye that embark in the service of God, see that ye serve 
him with all your heart, miglht, mind and strength, that ye may stand 
blameless before God at the last day; 

Therefore, if ye have desires to serve God, ye are called to the work, 

For behold the field is white already to harvest, and lo, he that thrust- 
eth in his sickle with his might, tthe same layeth up in store that he perish 
not, but bringeth salvation to his soul; 

And faith, hope, charity and love, with an eye single to the glory of 
God, qualify him for the work. 

Remember faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, brotherly 
kindness, godliness, charity, humility, diligence.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Ask and ye shall receive, knock and it shall he opened unto you. (Doc. 
trine and Covenants, Section 4.) 

Truly a great and marvelous work has come forth and been pro- 
claimed in every land and in every clime all over the wide world. The 
gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored — by a personal visitation of 
the apostles Peter, James and John, laying their hands upon the heads 
of Oliver Cowdery and the Prophet Joseph Smith and ordaining them 
to the apostleship; by a personal visitation of John the Baptist, who 
baptized the Savior, laying his hands upon Oliver Cowdery and Joseph 
Smith and ordaining them to the Aaronic, or the lesser priesthood — 
the gospel is again restored to the earth, with the power and authority 
that existed in the days of the Savior. Millions of dollars in money 
have been expended for erecting and maintaining temples wherein or- 
dinances are performed for the salvation of those who have died 
without a knowledge of the gospel. All these things bear witness of 
the inspiration of God to that man Joseph Smith, when he delivered 
this statement in a revelation to his father, that a great and a marvelous 
work was about to come forth among the children of men. 

TRIBUTE TO LATTER-DAY SAINTS. 

The readiness, the willingness, the spirit of sacrifice among 
the Latter-day Saints are an inspiration to those not of our faith. I 
had intended to read here this morning some of the very splendid 
things that were said in the United States Senate regarding the Latter- 
day Saints by the senators from Nevada, from Colorado and from Ari- 
zona. I did not intend to read anything said by our own senator from 
Utah, but I rejoice when men not of our faith can bear the testimony 
that these men did, respecting the loyalty of our people. 

[President Grant here read selections from the speeches of the sen- 
ators referred to. The tributes, in full, however, including the speech of 
Senator Smoot, are here given]: 

BY SENATOR SMOOT, OF UTAH. 

Mr. Smoot. Mr. President, I am not going to occupy more than about 
15 minutes of the time of the Senate. 

For over 16 years I have paid no attention whatever to any of the 
false and malicious newspaper reports and statements, made against the so- 
called "Mormon" Church. The only excuse that I have to offer for doing 
so at this time is that I have received a request from members of a number 
of the principal clubs of the State of Utah to call the attention of the 
Senate and of the country to certain false statements published in dif- 
ferent newspapers throughout the United States. 

First, I desire to call attention to an article that appeared in the 
New York World of October 22, under the date line of London, October 21. 
This same article, I will state, was published in many other newspapers 
throughout the United States. It is as follows: 

"Girls, Mormon Converts, Want to Leave England. — Fully 1,200 
of them, Says Authoress, Have Asked Passports so They Can go to 
Utah. 

"London, October 21. 
. "Winifred Graham, the well-known English authoress, who has 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT.

done much in this country to expose Mormonism, told the World 
correspondent today that fully 1,200 English girls hrve recently 
been persuaded by Mormon propagandists here to go to Utah. 
'During the war,' she said, 'the Mormons made great headway in 
the United Kingdom. I hope the American authorities will pre- 
vent the departure of these girls for America. From reliable sources 
I learn that there are 1,200 of them anxious to sail immediately. 
Only last week one was bound over in a London police court for 
falsification of a passport in her efforts to go to Utah.' 

"Winifred Graham is the pen name of Mrs. Theodore Cory. 
She sails on the Baltic October 29 as the Britislh delegate to the 
World Citizenship Congress in Pittsburgh, which begins November 
9. She will speak on Mormonism. Her anti-Mormon work here, 
she says, has caused her to be shadowed and threatened by the 
Mormons. United States consuls are on the lookout for any Mor- 
mon converts. Owing to the strict passport regulations tin re is lit- 
tle chance that any of these English girls will be able to sail. Some 
of the girls to whom passport vises were refused recently were sus- 
pected of being Mormon converts." 

Mr. President, I thought the time had arrived when the newspapers 
of the country would cease publishing such rot. How easy it is for any 
newspaper to send a representative to the Bureau of Immigration and find 
out just the number of immigrants entering the United States going to the 
State of Utah for any year in the past, and also to find out the professions 
and occupation of the immigrants, and the different classification of each 
as provided by the department. If the newspaper doing so wants to publish 
the truth it would never publish such statements as I have just read. 

I went to the department, upon my attention being called to the news- 
paper article and asked for a statement of the number of immigrants for 
Utah for the years of 1917, 1918, and 1919. The statistics taken from the 
annual report of the Commissioner General of Immigration show some 
interesting facts. I have taken the State of Utah and compared it with 
the State of Colorado and the following is the result:

The above table shows that the total number of immigrants with no 
occupation — including women and children — going to Utah was smaller 
on a percentage basis than the same class going to Colorado. 

It also shows the percentage of English immigrants of the total which 
went to both states, the percentage being about the same. 

Mr. President, the Commercial Club of Salt Lake City, the leading 
business club of the State of Utah, upon seeing this scurrilous article against 
the "Mormon" Church published throughout the United States, prepared 
and issued a statement, dated November 4, 1919, entitled "Refutation issued 
by the board of governors of the Commercial Club of Salt Lake City," which 
I desire to read, as follows: 

A STATEMENT OF REFUTATION. 

Issued by the Board of Governors of the Commercial Club, Salt Lake City. 
The attention of the Salt Lake Commercial Club has been called to the

GEX /• R. \L CON I'EREN CE. 



appearance in newspapers in the United States, of a "syndicate article" bear- 
ing the date line of London, Eng., in some instances as "October 19", from 
the pen of one purporting to be George Selden, writer of the English me- 
tropolis, which is vicious, inconsistent and maliciously false in its accusa- 
tions against the "Mormon" Church. 

This article, sent broadcast through the United States, contains quota- 
tions credited to one Winifred Graham, to whom the article refers as a nov- 
elist, some of which are as follows: 

"What is Mormonism doing in England? It works secretly as 
in America and snaps its fingers at law in both countries. This very 
minute the Church elders have twelve hundred girls ready for ship- 
ment to Utah. 

"The Mormon Church pays the fares and offers excellent wages, 
but once it gets women over it uses them as it pleases. The war 
gave the Mormon elders their greatest opportunity for proselyting. 
In the absence of the men folk and because of the deaths of thou- 
sands of soldiers, the women of the poorer classes fell easy victims. 
Secret meetings were held in homes that attracted the neighborhood 
without attracting suspicion. 

"Every girl is baptized. They then become silent about polyg- 
amy, but they become either polygamous wives or slaves of the 
Mormon Church. Occasionally we hear of girls who are slaving on 
Mormon farms." 



The Commercial Club of Salt Lake City, Utah, through its duly con- 
stituted Board of Governors, hereby desires that it be known that it has 
taken cognizance of and read these statements, which it brands as being 
vicious in intent and so obviously inconsistent as to be their own refutation, 
and they are scandalous, pernicious and false. 

The Commercial Club, in line with its activities from the time of its 
organization, is critically persistent and thorough in its survey of conditions 
relating to the interests of our commonwealth and is fully qualified by its 
knowledge of facts to thus brand these sensational stories as unmitigated 
falsehoods. 

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, commonly called the 
"Mormon" Church, is working in harmony with other institutions in Utah, 
ecclesiastical and civic, for the maintenance of the highest attainable stan- 
dard of morality, and has made an enviable record in their accomplish- 
ment, as also in patriotic and devoted service to the country's needs. 

This Commercial Club disavows and condemns, with disapprobation 
equally strong the circulate* falsehoods of "Mormon" interference in State 
or National politics. The "Mormon" people exercise their political rights 
and preferences in common with their fellow-citizens who are not of their 
faith; and this Club unhesitatingly affirms that the stories alleging "Mor- 
mon" control of political parties in this State or elsewhere are but myths 
and fables, without even the merit of apparent consistency to excuse their 
periodical re-telling. (Sgd.) Lester D. Freed,

(Board of Governors) 

Mr. President, I protest against the libelous press matter that has been 
published throughout the country, that the blatantly heralded announce- 
ment of the falsehoods an English writer of fiction has come here to tell. 
The Church has nothing to conceal. I want the people of the United States 
to know that as far as polygamy is concerned it is dead, and scandalmongers 
in the future must find some other hobby to ride. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT.

All I ask is that the "Mormon" Church and its adherents be judged by 
the fruit of the tree. No one can examine the record made by that people 
during the World War without coming to the conclusion that no more loyal 
people live on this earth. No call was made upon them without an immed- 
iate response, and not only for the amount asked for but for nearly double 
the amount in most every case. They not only furnished their quota of 
soldiers but in some of the calls 100 and 200 per cent more. 

Mr. President, I would not have taken the time of the Senate to make 
this short statement if it had not been requested of me. I will say: The 
signers of the statement of refutation are at least three-fourths non-mem- 
bers of the "Mormon" Church, and they are the leading business men of 
the State. It seems to me that the people of this country ought now to 
understand the true situation and if the. "New "York World" or the "New 
York American" desires to learn the truth about the "Mormon" people, I 
will gladly pay all expenses of a representative of either paper, if it desired 
to make an honest investigation. 

I am a Senator of the United States. I represent all the people of Utah 
and not any church as such. I have never felt called upon to defend the 
"Mormon" Church against false attacks, because I felt that sooner or later 
the truth would be understood by all the people. I am not making this 
statement as a representative of the "Mormon" Church but as a United 
States Senator. 

The "Mormon" Church has been foully misrepresented from many 
sources in the past. I confidently look forward to the day when the "Mor- 
mon" people will be known as they are and not as represented. 

BY SENATOR ASHURST, OF ARIZONA. 

Mr. Ashurst. Mr. President, I am very glad that the Senator from 
Utah [Mr. Smoot] has spoken as he has. It was time for such a speech. 
A matchless maker of epigrams said that when "once a lie or a counterfeit 
statement gets into circulation it is well-nigh impossible to overtake it", 
and therefore I believe the Senator has done a service to his country in ex- 
posing this infamous slander, which has been published broadcast against so 
many worthy people. 

When I read the article, I felt offended because there are in Arizona 
a large number of "Mormon" people, or people who belong to the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; and I would be false to that principle 
of fair play for which I have always pretended that I stood if I failed at 
this time to say a word on the subject. 

Tt may be true that I do not understand fully the theology of the "Mor- 
mon" Church; but, Mr. President, the first church I ever attended was a 
"Mormon" Church. When there was no other church within 100 miles of the 
lonely frontier cabin where my parents lived, we found solace and comfort 
in attending the "Mormon" Church situated 9 miles distant. Our nearest — 
in fact, our only — neighbors for years were the "Mormon" people. Better 
neighbors no pioneer ever had. I am proud of the "Mormon" people. I 
am proud of the friendship that I have for them, and that I believe they 
have for me; and while, as I said before, I do not completely understand 
their theology, I am able to say here, in the Senate of the United States, 
that their church has elevated many intellects and purified many hearts m 
my State. 

As pioneers in a new country, the "Mormons" are unrivaled. They are 
sober, industrious, frugal, honest. They are pre-eminently state builders; 
and today, if called upon to name a people who could most expeditiously 
transform a desert of swirling and heated sands into splendid fields sind 
farms, I would unhesitatingly choose the "Mormon" people. In mnny 
places where once cacti lifted their thorny arms into the brazen and heni.ed 
air, "Mormon" industry has reared temples, hospitals, homes, factories, 
and schools. 

Moreover. T never saw a "Mormon" I. W. W. ; but X have, at some

count}- courthouses in my State, heard disgruntled, lazy, and indolent men 
who did not belong to the "Mormon" Church, sit on. the steps of the court- 
house and curse the Government and curse the President, while ''Mormon" 
citizens were going into the same county courthouse to pay taxes with- 
out complaint. 

Mr. Owen. Mr. President — — 

Mr. Ashurst. I yield for a question. 

Mr. Owen. I should like to ask the Senator if it is not a tenet of the 
"Mormons" to teach and preach industry and thrift? 

Mr. Ashurst. I am able to state that industry and thrift are amongst 
the foundation stones of the "Mormon" Church. Absolute and unques- 
tioned obedience to law is a tenet of the "Mormon" Church. Respect for 
authority is one of the tenets of the "Mormon" Church. We need more 
of such people in thesd perilous times of the Republic; and again I would 
be false to every principle of justice and to every sentiment of gratitude if 
I failed to state at this time that when savage Indians galloped along 
by our pioneer homes, burning and murdering, plundering and scalping as 
they went, it was to the "Mormon" people that my defenseless but heroic 
parents went for refuge and defense. 

So, Mr. President, I say the Senator from Utah has done well in 
"scotching" this falsehood, which has been given such wide circulation. 
I believe the American people ar coming at last fully to undrstand the 
"Mormon" people. Their temples, schools, fields, homes, industry, frugality, 
their morality and their patriotism testify for them in more eloquent terms 
than the Senator or I could speak. Then, again, observe their Representa- 
tives in the House and in the Senate. Look at the high class of public ser- 
vants they send here. I ask that the "Mormons" be judged as a people, 
judged as a religion, as the Senator says, by their fruits; and if they be 
judged by their fruits the verdict of the world will be in their favor. 

It seems to me that the time should be welcomed in America when 
men shall not further be assailed because of their religion or lack of re- 
ligion. Men ought not further to be assailed or discriminated against be- 
cause of their particular view of how to follow the Master. America was 
built up, and one of the reasons why the migrations came from the old 
countries to these shores was that our ancestors desired to find a place to 
build free and strong states where such ignoble sentiments as bigotry 
could not survive. 

Mr. President, I do not forget that this splendid domain of Arizona, 
one of the imperial states of this Union, came into being largely through the 
brave exploits of the "Mormon" people. When General Stephen Kearny 
was beleaguered near San Diego during the Mexican War, and it seemed 
as if the Mexicans were going to capture and annihilate him and his entire 
command, it was the "Mormon" battalion that marched all the long way 
from Iowa into Tucson, Arizona, and occupied in Mexican territory a do- 
main we now know as the Gadsden Purchase, which was purchased by our 
Government in 1854. When the commanding officer, Lieut. Col. St. George 
Cooke, entered the Mexican town of Tucson and raised the American flag, 
he issued a pronunciamento, and I wish the German outragers had read 
that document before they invaded Belgium. The lieutenant colonel en- 
tering the city of Tucson, nearly 1,500 miles from civilization, said in his 
manifesto to the people of Mexico: 

_ "We do not war upon civilians. We make war against men in 
uniform only. The property of individuals will be held sacred. 
All civil rights will be upheld. Those who obey the law and con- 
form to order will be protected." 

The command remained there some days to refresh itself and then 
marched on to the relief of General Kearny, who, as I said, was beleagured 
and surrounded near San Diego. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT.

So, Mr. President, the "Mormon" people, as pioneers, as state-builders, 
as statesmen, as people of industry and patriotism, in every department <^f 
life, compare well and favorably with the general mass of their fellow citi- 
zens. This much I feel I should have said; more than that I need not say. 

BY SENATOR THOMAS, OF COLORADO. 

Mr. Thomas. Mr. President, I am not and never have been a com- 
municant of any church, and if I live to be as old again as I am now, I 
would not change. In my youth 1 was greatly impressed with a remark of 
Gibbon, that "all religions are to the vulgar equally true, to the philosopher 
equally false, and to the statesman equally useful," and the experience of 
mature years has served to deepen the impression. I have never been able 
to reconcile the tenets and doctrines of all religious faiths with that spirit 
of persecution and fanaticism they develop toward each other, and which 
has so many times culminated in destructive and decimating wars. I 
believe in religious toleration, without any conditions whatever, except 
those required by the tenets of morality and of law and order. Hence I 
have remained aloof from identification with any faith. 

Up to this time I have never found occasion to publicly defend the 
"Mormon" people, because it has not seemed necessary; but I can not 
allow the occasion to pass without paying tribute to their morality and 
usefulness, not only to their own communities, but as exemplars to the 
whole country in perilous times like these. 

Mr. President, when respect for the law is the exception and not the 
rule, when the different forces of society are so antagonistic that the po- 
litical structure is menaced with danger, it is refreshing to note that the 
adherents of this faith have at all times been the advocates and the ex- 
ponents of peace, of justice, of law, and of order; and however just the 
criticisms aimed against former institutions, the fact remains, as established 
by more than half a century of practice, that the communities professing 
the "Mormon" faith are among the best and highest exemplars of American 
citizenship. 

During the war there was much disloyalty in America.. Scarcely any 
commonwealth was entirely free from it. During the war resistance to 
the draft occasionally punctuated our dispatches, and the expression of 
toleration or friendliness to the enemy was one of the commonest of occur- 
rences. But during that critical period upon no occasion which I can re- 
member did the people of Utah, "Mormon" and Gentile, fail to whole-heart- 
edly, loyally, and enthusiastically respond to every -call made by the Gov- 
ernment for soldiers or for money. Not in a single instance did this peo- 
ple falter. Their splendid youth were given freely to our armies, and the 
blood of their boys sanctifies the soil of every battle field in France. 
y Every loan drive was responded to, not by the quota, but far beyond it, 
and in everything that contributed to good citizenship, to patriotism, to 
loyalty, and to love of country, these people were ever conspicuous; and 
it is due to them, as one of the representatives from a neighboring state 
wherein many of these people are located, and are among our best citizens, 
that I should say so. 

We have not many "Mormons" in the State of Colorado. Some years 
ago a settlement was established in what is known as the San Luis Valley. 
It has grown, it has flourished, it is prosperous. Its people are law-abiding, 
they are industrious, they are hard working, they pay their debts, they 
obey and support the authorities. Bolshevism, anarchism, and socialism 
are foreign to the atmosphere of that community. They can not take root 
in such a soil. 

These people are today, therefore, one of the pillars of the social, 
'economic, and political systems of the country, whose removal might im- 
peril the entire structure of our social, economic, and political life. Their 
faith I am not concerned with; their character and their achievements are 
a credit to them and an incalculable benefit to the country.

GEN UK. \L CONFERENCE. 



BY SENATOR HENDERSON, OF NEVADA. 

Mr. Henderson. .Mr. President, I wish to express my approval of and 
join in all that has been said by ihe >emor Senator from Colorado [Mr. 
Thomas] relative to those of the "Mormon" faith. We have in eastern 
Nevada a number of "Mormon" settlements. I have visited a number of 
them. 1 wish to say that there are no better citizens in the country than 
those of that faith. In one community that I know of, established over 40 
years ago, there has never been a jail. I believe that is true of the others. 
These people never have any use for jails. Where they go, law and order 
prevail, and thrift and economy are taught and practiced. 

Mr. President, the record of the "Mormon" people, throughout the 
war has been without a blemish. Their sons were amongst the first to en- 
list and their quota was quickly filled. They oversubscribed their pro- 
portion of Liberty bonds. Their patriotism has been of the highest order 
and without question. 

There is much that can be said in their favor, Mr. President, but I 
shall not detain the Senate longer, as there are some Senators waiting to 
address the Senate on the proposed reservation to article 10. I am glad, 
however, of the opportunity to express my disapproval of the attack di- 
rected against the "Mormons" referred to by the Senator from Utah [Mr. 
Smoot]. 

I thank the Lord that these Senators can truthfully pay such 
tributes to our people. 

I wish to lift my voice and to warn every member of the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints against the destruction of the 
property of any man, of any corporation or of any city in these United 
States of America. 

LATTER-DAY SAINTS WORK AGAINST DESTRUCTION OF PROPERTY. 

Property is the fruit of labor; property is desirable, it is a positive good 
in the world; that some should be rich shows that others may become rich 
and hence is just encouragement to industry and enterprise. Let not him 
who is houseless pull down the house of another, but let him work dili- 
gently and build one for himself, thus by example assuring that his own 
shall be safe from violence when built."— Abraham Lincoln. 

There is an evil rampant, at the present time, among some 
who are teaching that it is justifiable to destroy property, 
and even to destroy life in trying- to accomplish their purposes, and I 
desire to lift my voice, with all the ability and with all the power with 
which God has endowed me, against anything of this kind. I have 
been criticized and letters have been written to me by professed Lat- 
ter-day Saints, finding fault with my remarks at the last conference 
about upholding the law ; and the only answer that I desire to give to 
these criticisms, as I have not taken the time to answer the letters is 
to read again the identical words that I delivered when I stood here 
before you six months ago. They were not premedidated or thought 
out and I have concluded that I could not do any better than to read 
them, word for word, and say they are my sentiments today: 

MUST RESPECT RIGHTS OF OTHERS. 

As Latter-day Saints we have what is known as The Articles of Faith, 
and one of them reads: 'We believe in being subject to kings, presidents 
rulers and magistrates, in obeying, honoring, and sustaining the law " and 
no Latter-day Saint can in very deed be a Latter-day Saints if he does not 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT. 



11 



honor and sustain and uphold the law. Nearly all over the world, at the 
present time there is a spirit of lawlessness, a spirit of ridicule, and a lack 
of respect for the men who hold positions. 

I want to say that I am perfectly willing that men shall join labor 
unions, that they shall band together for the purpose of protecting their 
rights, provided they do not interfere with the right? of other people. Life, 
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness belong to all people in the United 
States, according to the laws of our country, and should, upon all the face 
of the earth; and I say that, to my mind, a provision in a labor union is 
all wrong that favors boycotting and the laying down of tools or the quit- 
ting of employment because a non-union man obtains employment while 
exercising his God-given right to stay out of a union. Men who have that 
kind of a rule have a rule that is in direct opposition to the laws of God. 
There was a battle fought in heaven — for what? To give to man his in- 
dividual liberty. An attempt to take the agency of man away is made 
when he does not see fit to join a union, and when men in that union, with- 
out any complaint or grievance, strike because a non-union man is em- 
ployed. 

Now, I'd better not say any more, perhaps, on this question, or I may 
offend somebody, I may hurt somebody's feelings; but it is the God-given 
right of men to earn their livelihood. The Savior said it was the first great 
law or commandment to love the Lord with all our hearts, and that the sec- 
ond was like unto it, to love thy neighbor as thyself. That is the doctrine 
for every true Latter-day Saint. How much love is there in starving your 
neighbor because he will not surrender his manhood and his individuality, 
and allow a labor union to direct his labor? Mighty little love, mighty 
little of the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ in any such a rule! I hope 
to see the day when no Latter-day Saint will join a union unless the union 
eliminate that clause from its rules. I am not going to ask them to leave 
their union. I am not going to lay it down that they must, that it is the 
mind and the will of the Lord for them to le<tve a union, I want, as I 
said here two weeks ago, to give every man Lis free agency, to give every 
man the right to act as he thinks proper, but I cannot see how a Latter- 
day Saint who is a member of such a union can get down on his knees 
and pray for God to inspire and bless him, to bless the Saints and to 
protect them and then be a party to allowing one of his own brethren to 
go, year after year, without employment, because that brother will not sur- 
render his manhood and join a union with him. There is none of the Spirit 
of the Lord in that, to my mind. That is exactlv the way I see it. 

I desire, as stated, to emphasize and re-emphasize those statements 
delivered here six months ago. I believe that it is the absolute right 
of men to combine together for their protection, for their advance- 
ment, for their welfare in unions, but as stated here, I deprecate the 
idea of their undertaking to dictate to those who will not join them. 
I believe this is all I desire to say upon that subject. 

PROGRESS IN THE MISSIONS. 

Since we last met here, it has fallen to my lot to hold meetings 
in the Central States Mission, in the Eastern States Mission, in the 
Canadian Mission, and three times in various parts of the California 
Mission. It has fallen to my lot to visit the capital of our Union and 
to hold a meeting there. It has fallen to my lot to visit some of the 
stakes of Zion, especially two in Arizona, the Maricopa and the St. 
Joseph stakes, and to hold a meeting in the capital of Arizona. I wish 
to say that I rejoice in the wonderful change of sentiment regarding 



12 



GENER. \L CONFERENCE. 



the Latter-day Saints that has come to people wherever I have met with 
them during the past six months. In addition to these visits I have 
had the privilege of visiting the Hawaiian Islands, with some of the 
hrethren of the general authorities, and of dedicating there to the 
Lord one more temple for holy ordinances for the salvation of the 
dead. And I want to hear witness to the Latter-day Saints that there 
was, with our small party on that trip to the Hawaiian Islands, in the 
dedication of that temple, in the various services that were held there, 
lasting for a number of days, the inspiration of the Lord God Al- 
mighty, and that we were hlcssed abundantly, beyond our power to 
tell. There is something that no mortal tongue can tell, when an in- 
dividual realizes and knows that while proclaiming the gospel of our 
Lord and Master Jesus Christ he has been blessed by the inspiration of 
the Lord; and that was our experience in dedicating another 
temple to the Lord in that far-off land. The Hawaiian people have 
a dark skin, but their hearts are white, their loyalty to God is per- 
fect, and the Lord Almighty has abundantly blessed many of that 
people by giving to them an absolute knowledge of the divinity of the 
work in which we are engaged. 

RESPIiCT GROWING FOR OUR CHURCH. 

I am thankful that wherever I have traveled during the past six 
months I have found a feeling of respect, a feeling of love in the 
hearts of many for the Latter-day Saints, in the hearts of those not of 
our faith. I heard many very splendid compliments while in Washing- 
ton by members of the president's cabinet, by senators and representa- 
tives, and by officials of the government in the Federal Reserve bank- 
ing departments, and in others, wherever I went, and with all the 
people that I met, bankers in New York, Chicago, San Francisco and 
other cities, I heard good things said of the Latter-day Saints; we 
are coming into our own, so to speak. Our character is becoming 
known, and no longer can men lie about "the Latter-day Saints, or 
women either, and get away with the lies with the great majority of 
the people in our country. 

While our reputation has been bad, this reputation has come to 
us, how? Because of the lies, as a rule, by men who have been ex- 
communicated from this Church. No loyal, patriotic American citizen 
wants the people of our country to be judged by the Benedict Arnolds 
that the country has produced ; but the men of America desire that our 
country shall be judged by its achievements, by the men who have 
been loyal to that God-inspired instrument, the Constitution of our 
country. All we ask of any people upon the face of the earth is that 
they shall judge the Latter-day Saints by Joseph Smith, the prophet 
of the living God, by the record that he made in the few short years 
that he stood at the head of the Church. The Church was organized in 
1830, 90 years ago, and he presided over it for only 14 years. The 
accomplishments of those 14 years under his administration, what he 
did, and what he left to the Church in the wonderful revelations that 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT. 



13 



he gave to us, in the translating of the Book of Mormon, that sacred 
Scripture .of the forefathers of the American Indian, and the wonder- 
ful labors that he performed, these stand as a monument stamping 
him, in very deed, a prophet of the living God. No man without the 
inspiration of God, in 14 short years, could have accomplished what 
Joseph Smith did; could have laid the foundation of this great work 
to which you and I belong. And as the years come and go, men are 
beginning to recognize the greatness of the labor he performed. 

MAKE SACRIFICES FOR GOSPEL. 

I remember as a boy that I borrowed a book from the Thirteenth 
ward Sunday School library ; it was on the evidences of Christianity by 
Dr. Paley, and I remember among other things, in that book, that he 
stated that the strongest evidence of the divine mission of the Savior 
of the world was the absolute loyalty of those who embraced Christian- 
ity, and their willingness to lay down their lives, if need be, for the 
testimony that they possessed of the divine mission of the Savior. I 
remember thinking as a boy: If that is the strongest evidence, of men 
being willing to lay down their lives and to voluntarily make sacrfices 
and to stand up under persecution, then that same identical evidence 
applies to the divine mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith. The Lat- 
ter-day Saints were driven from city to city, county to county, state 
to state, and finally beyond the confines of the United States to the 
Rocky Mountains, then Mexican territory. They could have had im- 
munity, they could have dwelt in peace, had they renounced their 
faith ; but our fathers and our mothers had received the witness of 
the Holy Spirit and they knew that Jesus was the Savior, they knew 
that Joseph Smith was in very deed a prophet of God. The Lord Al- 
mighty had implanted in their hearts a knowledge that God did, one 
hundred years ago this spring, appear to a boy ; that he did speak to 
that boy ; and that when the boy asked of our Father in Heaven, 
"Which of all the religious denominations in the world is the true 
Church of Christ?" in answer to that question our God and our Father 
pointed to the Savior of the world and said : "This is my beloved Son, 
hear Him." The Savior of the world told that boy to join none of 
the sects, that they had all gone astray, that they were teaching for 
doctrine the ideas and the commandments of men, and that they did 
not have the true Church of Christ. When that boy returned from 
that wonderful and marvelous vision, the greatest event in all the his- 
tory of the world, excepting only the birth and death of the Savior, 
his mother saw that there was something strange about his appearance 
and asked him some questions ; and he simply answered, in substance, 
and said to his mother (who was a Presbyterian) : "Mother, there is 
one thing I know now, and that is that the Presbyterian church is not 
the Church of Christ." 

When he related his vision to ministers and others the boy was 
ridiculed. 

Three years later an angel of God appeared and told him there 
was buried in the hill Cumorah some golden plates containing a record, 



14 



GENERAL CON EEREN CE. 



a sacred record of the forefathers of the American Indian, and that 
he should be the instrument in the hands of God of translating those 
plates. The angel gave him many wonderful instructions and quoted 
much Scripture to him ; then disappeared. He returned and repeated 
his instructions and disappeared. He returned again and repeated those 
instructions, the three visitations occupying the entire night. The next 
day when that boy went to his work in the field with his father, having 
had no rest during the night, his father saw that he was not feeling 
well and told him to go home ; and as he was climbing a fence he faint- 
ed, but he was aroused from his faint by the voice of the messenger 
who for the fourth time repeated all that he had said during the prev- 
ious night, and told him to go back to his father and tell his father 
all that, he had heard and seen. This he did. and the boy's father 
answered: "This is of God. Listen to the teachings of the angel." The 
boy visited the hill Cumorah ; he saw the plates and was instructed 
by the messenger to come there once a year for four' years, to be in- 
structed by that angel of God, regarding the great and marvelous work 
that was to come forth in the last days. At the end of four years the 
plates containing the record were delivered to him by the angel Moroni. 
He translated those plates, and the translation is the Book of Mormon. 

VAST MULTITUDE HAVE TESTIMONY. 

but, says one, I don't believe a word of it. There are thousands, 
there are tens of thousands of men and women, from the midnight sun 
country in Scandinavia to South Africa, all over Europe, from Canada 
to South America, in every state of the Union of the United States, 
upon the islands of the Pacific, who stand up and in all humility bear 
witness before high heaven that God has given to them a knowledge 
that Joseph Smith did see him, that Joseph Smith did see the Savior 
of the world, that Joseph Smith was visited by angels of God, that he 
was ordained to the apostleship, that he did in very deed commune 
with the Savior of the world, that he was a prophet of the living God. 
All the non-belief, all the lack of faith of all the people in all the world 
cannot change that fact, if it be a fact, and God has given many of us 
a knowledge, an absolute knowledge that it is a fact, that Joseph Smith 
was a prophet and that this Gospel, called by the world "Mormonism," 
is in very deed the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. 

TESTIMONY OF PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

1 want to read one of the latest testimonies regarding the divinity 
of this gospel, given from this stand by our late beloved Prophet, 
Joseph F. Smith, as to where divine authority exists today : 

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is no partisan church. 
It is not a sect. It is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It 
is the only one today existing in the world that can and does legitimately 
bear the name of Jesus Christ and his divine authority. I make this declara- 
tion in all simplicity and honesty before you and before all the world, bit- 
ter as the truth may seem to those who are opposed and who have no 
reason for that opposition. It is nevertheless true and will remain true 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT. 



15 



until he who has a right to rule among the nations of the earth and among 
the individual children of God throughout the world shall come and take the 
reins of government and receive the bride that shall be prepared for the 
coming of the Bridegroom. 

Many of our great writers have recently been querying and wondering 
where the divine authority exists today to fommand in the name of the 
Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost, so that it will be in effect 
and acceptable at the throne of the Eternal Father. I will announce here 
and now, presumptuous as it may seem to be to those who know not the 
truth, that the divine authority of Almighty God, to speak in the name of 
the Father and of the Son, is here in the midst of these^ everlasting thills, 
in the midst of this intermountain region, and it will abide and will con- 
tinue, for God is its source, and God is the power by which it has been main- 
tained against all opposition in the world up tb.the present, and by which 
it will continue to progress and grow and increase on the earth until it 
shall cover the earth from sea to sea. This is my testimony to you, my 
brethren and sisters, and I have a fulness of joy and of satisfaction in being- 
able to declare this without regard to, or fear of, all the adversaries of 
the truth. 

We heard sung here three verses of the hymn, "O, say what is 
truth?" and I request that in the future the choir sing all four verses, 
and not omit the last. 

OH, SAY, WHAT IS TRUTH? 

O, say, what is truth? Tis the fairest gem 

That the riches of worlds can produce 
And priceless the value of truth will be, 
When the proud monarch's costliest diadem 

Is' counted but dross and refuse. 

Yes, say what is truth? 'Tis the brightest prize 

To which mortals or Gods can aspire: 
Go search in the depths where it flittering lies. 
Or ascend in pursuit to the loftiest skies; 

'Tis an aim for the noblest desire. 

The scepter may fall from the despot's grasp, 

When with winds of stern justice he copes; 
But the pillar of truth will endure to the last 
And its firm-rooted bulwarks outstand the rude blast 

And the wreck of the fell tyrant's hopes. 

Then, say, what is truth? 'Tis the hist and the first, 

For the limits of time it steps o'er: 
Though the heavens depart and the earth's fountains burst, 
Truth, the sum of existence, will weather the worst, 

Eternal, unchanged, evermore. 

CLOSING TESTIMONY. 

And I bear witness to you, here today that we have the truth, 
that God has spoken again, that every gift, every grace, every power, 
and ^ every endowment W came through the Holy Priesthood o the 
Hving God in the days of the Savior, are enjoyed today God lives 
Testis the Christ, Joseph Smith was a prophet of the true and the 
ivma God "Mormonisrn," so called, is in very deed the gospel of

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the Lord Tesus Christ. God has given me a witness of these things. 
I know them and I bear that witness to you, in all humility, and I 
do it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang, "Praise to the man who com- 
muned with Jehovah." Three verses were sung and President Heber 
J. Grant stated that hereafter he would like to have the fourth verse 
sung by the choir whenever sung in his presence. He then read the 
last verse of the hymn. 

PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND 

I hope that the remarks I shall make can be heard by you. I 
know you are all able to hear our President, and we all rejoiced 
in the strong testimony that he bore of the truth of the gospel as re- 
vealed through the Prophet Joseph Smith. I felt thankful that in 
my heart I could say "Amen" to that testimony. 

THE. LATTER-DAY SAINTS NOT RECOGNIZED BY THE WORLD AS 
CHRISTIANS. 

Ever since I can remember, almost, I have had a testimony of 
the truth of that which the world calls "Mormonism." I know it 
is the gospel of Jesus Christ and I know that men upon the earth 
hold the power of the holy Priesthood, which enables them to per- 
form the ordinances that are given for the salvation of men. How 
thankful we ought to be that the Lord has given us this knowledge 
concerning his will and what he wishes us to do. We have not been 
recognized by the world as being a Christian people ; but we do claim 
that if there be any people upon the earth who believe in Jesus Christ 
as the Savior of the world, it is the Latter-day Saints. How strange 
it is, when men have read our articles of faith, that they can believe 
that the "Mormons" are not Christians ! When I say "Christians" I 
mean those who believe in Jesus Christ. 

THE SAINTS BELIEVE SINCERELY IN JESUS CHRIST AND TRY TO OBEY 
THE COMMANDMENTS OF GOD. 

We know that he is the Son of God ; we believe in him as the 
Redeemer of the world and as the Savior of mankind. That we are 
not Christians is held by the world. In their so-called Christian con- 
ventions, they do not wish to hear anything from us. Notwithstand- 
ing the fact that they did admit heathens, or men not believing in 
God, to come and give their religious beliefs to the Convention of 
Religions, yet they were not willing that we should explain our be- 
lief. However, we are trying to reach the hearts of the people. Our 
missionaries go out by the hundreds and thousands into the world. 
They seek to reach the people; they go from door to door, patiently 
enduring the mocking remarks- that are made concerning them; and yet 



PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND. 



17 



they are always willing to explain what the Lord has given them, and 
to declare the message which they have for all mankind. 

We, brethren and sisters, have received the gospel, and all of 
us ought to feel that we owe the duty to our heavenly Father and 
to our fellow men to make known unto them what the Lord .has 
shown us. We must be careful to so live that the Spirit of the Lord 
is alive within us. We must try to live according to the command- 
ments that our heavenly Father has given us. We know that they 
are for the betterment of men. ' 

I was pleased to read the remarks of Senator Ashurst and others 
in the Senate of the United States. I know that what they said con- 
cerning this people is true. They knew the truth of these things, and 
they were brave enough, in spite of the opposition of the world, to 
speak as they did regarding the Latter-day Saints. There are many 
others who believe the same, but are afraid to bear their testimony 
of what they know. I pity such ; but I honor those who are brave 
enough to express what they know to be true concerning a people, 
even if that people should be like the people of old that Paul tells 
us "were everywhere spoken against." If they -will search and in- 
vestigate, they will find that the Latter-day Saints, as a people, try 
to live their religion, and to keep the commandments of God, that 
they are prayerful and try to seek the Lord early and late to obtain 
power and strength from him to carry out that which they know to 
be right. 

THE SAINTS ENJOTNED TO ATTEND SACRAMENTAL MEETINGS. 

During the past year we have had much to be grateful for. We 
are especially thankful to know that the people are living their religion 
and are showing in their works that they are in earnest. If I should 
find any fault with our people, it is this, that they should be more at- 
tentive to quorum meetings of the Priesthood and to sacrament 
meetings. In some places there can be but little fault found ; while in 
others, there seems to be some carelessness about attending our meet- 
ings. Now, brethren and sisters, we cannot develop in godliness 
without going to the meetings. We should be present to hear the 
servants of God and to partake of the Sacrament of the Lord, and 
renew our covenants with him, showing that we are willing to take 
upon us his name and keep his commandments. It gives us strength 
to do so ; but by staying away from sacrament meetings, we gradually 
grow careless, and we think that we cannot be edified by attending 
them. Do not go to meeting just because a good speaker is going to 
talk, but go to the meetings as the Lord has commanded that on 
the Sabbath day we should go to the house of prayer and offer our ob- 
lations to the Almighty. Do not let us be lacking in this nor in other 
duties. 

THE LORD BLESSES THOSE WHO PAY AN HONEST TITHING. 

You heard how much had been expended last year for different 
things to uphold the work of the Church. This shows that the Saints 



18 



GENER. I L CON EE REN CE. 



have attended to the duty of paying their tithing. There are those, 
however, who ought to be encouraged to obey that law more strictly 
than they do. We honor those who are honest with the Lord, who pay 
their tithing which they owe unto him. Those who do so will feel 
blessed. They are not the ones who complain of how the tithing is 
spent, but they feel blessed in paying a tenth as the tithing of their 
income, knowing that the Lord sees what they are doing, and knows 
their hearts, and they will receive their reward for so doing. We 
would like to encourage all to obey this law, whether they owe a few 
cents or many dollars. They should remember the law of tithing and 
remember that the Lord blesses those who pay an honest tithing, be it 
little or much. 

WARNING AGAINST FOLLOWING FALSE TEACHERS. 

There are some who think they are in advance of the rest of the 
people, and they are trying to strike out in certain different courses. 
I would like to say to the Latter-day Saints : Let no one deceive you, 
let no one draw you away from the pale of the Church ; for within 
it there are the servants of the Lord who have been authorized to ad - 
minister unto you and to perform the ordinances of the gospel. You 
will not find that authority outside of the Church. If one pretends 
that he is the one "great and mighty," or that he has power to start 
a new church to improve on this, examine carefully before you take a 
step away from the Church. You will not be happy if you follow such 
men. True happiness will come to you if you keep 'the covenants which 
you have made with the Lord. The covenants that we have made, at the 
time we were baptized, in holy places, are all for our good to help us 
to come nearer to the Lord and to know his will. As we have made 
covenants to do his will, let us not forget what we have promised to 
do. There is a joy in knowing that we are fulfilling our duty, and there 
is sorrow in our hearts when we feel that we are not doing it. Of 
course, by continuing in negligence, our conscience may not smite us 
so much as at first ; but let us all listen to that monitor which the 
Lord has given us; listen to the whisperings of the Holy Spirit and 
try to -so live that we may feel, by the Spirit of God that we are 
acceptable in the sight of the Lord. 

THOUGHTS ON THE FIRST VISION AND WHAT FOLLOWED. 

There has been some reference here today to the first vision of 
the Prophet Joseph, which we look upon as the dawn of this last dis- 
pensation, the dispensation of the fulness of times. It} was indeed the 
bee ginning, the very initiating of this work ; and the Lord chose an 
instrument, not learned and educated, but a man who was willino- to 
do that which he should be commanded to do. He had full faith in 
the Lord and was ever ready to offer himself and his time for the up- 
building of this work. We just sang a beautiful hymn about him. 
He did accomplish a great work during the short time that was given 



PRESIDENT ANTHON II. LUND. 19 



him to live, after the Church was organized and those years preceding 
the organization of the Church. How much we rejoice to read what 
he did ! He was poor, he had to work for his living, and yet the great 
task of translating the Book of Mormon was given unto him. Some 
have thought: "Well now, the Lord owns everything; why did he not 
bestow enough upon the Prophet so that he could do his work more 
easily?" Not so; the Lord gave him a task to do and he gave him his 
Spirit also that he might have strength to do it. He raised up friends 
to the Prophet who were willing to help, even with their temporal 
means — such a man as Martin Harris, such men as David Whitmer 
and Oliver Cowdery. They came to his help before the Church was 
organized. Full of faith, they were willing to assist him, and with 
this help, the Prophet was enabled to translate those ancient writings 
and to publish the Book of Mormon unto the world. Many have 
studied that book and have tried to find some fault with it. Now, in 
reading it, we see that it covers a period of about a thousand years, 
relating to the Lamanites and Nephites, and a much longer time 
to those who left the Tower of Babel, the people of Jared and his 
br< -her. Yet by the search of critics they have not been able to find 
anj anachronism or wrong time in its chronology. The whole book 
is a unit, although it was written by a number of writers. They were 
inspired by the Lord, as were those who wrote the holy Scriptures, 
called the Bible. The holy Scriptures called the Book of Mormon 
were written by different men, prophets of the Lord, and they were all 
true men. The book is a unit as to doctrine and as to the spirit that 
goes through it. 

I have referred to the men who helped the Prophet Joseph. 
They bore a strong testimony concerning the truth of that book. They 
knew they had seen the engravings that were on the plates. They 
knew that they were translated correctly, because a voice from heaven 
had so declared, and an angel from heaven had shown these things unto 
them. After that these men could not say that Joseph Smith had de- 
ceived them. They knew for themselves that the testimony which now 
appears in the front of the book was true. Notwithstanding the fact 
that these men became careless, and some fell into transgression and 
were cut off from the Church, yet they continued to bear a truthful 
testimony of what they had written in that book. Two of them came 
back into the Church. 

One of them, David Whitmer, remained outside of the Church 
until his death ; but hundreds of visitors came to him, knowing that 
he was not what they called a "Mormon ;" that is, that he did not 
belong to* the Church, and they thought they would get what they de- 
sired as the truth from him ; but he was always ready to bear the testi- 
mony that he saw the plates, and even on his death bed he bore that 
testimony. 

Martin Harris, we know, came here and from this stand has 
borne his testimony to the truth of the translation of the Book of 
Mormon from ancient plates. 

Oliver Cowdery came to the Church when it was at its lowest

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ebb, I may say, when it looked as if the Church was not able to con- 
tinue as a Church ; for the people had been driven into the wilderness, 
and several divisions had taken place and members had been scat- 
tered ; but he came to the little branch at Council Bluffs and asked 
simply that he might become a member of the Church. He did not 
join the Church to become a leading member in it or to hold a big 
office. He came because he did not dare to die outside of the pale 
of the Church, and he did not live many months afterward. But he 
bore the testimony to that congregation that the gospel is true, that 
he had seen angels, that Joseph and he had been ordained to the 
Priesthood, both the Aaronic and the Melchizedek Priesthood. This 
testimony he bore to them and he asked forgiveness for the past and, 
like any other member who had been excommunicated, he asked, pen- 
itently that he might come into the Church and become a member with 
the rest of them. 

While, as it has been said, three of the witnesses left the Church, 
yet they always bore that faithful testimony that the Book of Mor- 
mon was true. They had helped in the translation and in the publish- 
ing of the book, and it is before the world. Oh, how many glorious 
truths it contains ! It is indeed an inspired work, and what the Prophet 
Joseph received and gave unto us we all bear the testimony is 
true; and while some people may have thought they were new doc- 
trines, because they were not understood by the world, we have 
found them to be true principles, and since that time we have proved 
them to be such. 

j 

the second vision and vicarious work for the dead. 

At the second vision that the Prophet Joseph received, when 
the angel Moroni came to him and told him about the Book of Mormon, 
<:r rather the plates that were concealed in the Hill Cumorah, he also 
told him things that Joseph, perhaps, could not fully understand; and. 
in crder, tbr.t the young man might not forget what he was told, the 
angel repeated thtm three times, spending the whole night with him. 
Among the things that were revealed to him was the principle of 
vicarious work for the dead, and the principle of the gathering of the 
people, principles of our Church that are unique to it. These were 
given by the angel Moroni. He also read from the book of Malachi 
about the hearts of children being turned to their fathers, and the 
fathers' hearts to the children. He read to him the eleventh chapter 
of Isaiah, which refers to the gathering; and other principles he ex- 
plained to the young man. Today we have heard read how much has 
been given for temples and for temple buildings, and this shows that 
the Latter-day Saints believe in the principle revealed to the Prophet 
Joseph as early as 1823. And just before his death, how interested 
he was m this work! He saw the great necessity that there was for 
the Saints to turn their hearts to the fathers, so as to avoid the curse 
that otherwise would come upon the earth. We have felt this todav 
We have gone into the temples, we have labored for our dead and 



PRESIDENT ANTHON H. LUND. 



21 



we have had the witness in our souls that the Lord accepted of the 
work. Many people have told me what they have heard and seen in 
the temples. Names have been given to them of persons they had 
forgotten, who wanted their work done. How interested the people 
have been in searching for their genealogies ! We must thank the 
genealogists of the world also, because they have come to our help. 
They have spent a great deal of money in publishing genealogies, es- 
pecially here in the United States ; also in England. They have begun 
the same work in other countries, too. The spirit is upon them ; their 
hearts are turning to their fathers. I know they do not believe in the 
necessity of doing work for them, but we believe that it is a necessity ; 
and it is a joy and blessing to us to do this. 

THE RESURRECTION OF JESUS CHRIST. 

Today we celebrate the resurrection of our Savior. This is in- 
deed one of the most hope-inspiring events that ever took place. Men 
have believed in life after death, but the real truth that there is such 
a thing as a resurrection was given by our Savior. . The testimony 
has come to us that many saw him after he was resurrected. Some 
have argued that the resurrection is not possible ; that we have never 
seen a person who has come back to us from another world, nor have 
we seen any who has seen such a person, and they argue that, there- 
fore, it cannot be possible that anybody was ever resurrected. 

Now, if we are to judge only by what we have experienced our- 
selves, I fear our knowing would be very small. We take the sayings 
of men, the writings of men and we believe what they have said and 
written. By this means we have extended our field of knowledge. It 
would be a very narrow conception to argue that things r that we have 
not seen cannot be true. We have the testimony of twelve men who 
saw the Savior after his resurrection. We have the testimony that 
five hundred men beheld him at one time. Ten times he was seen 
after his resurrection. His apostles and disciples felt very down- 
hearted when they saw that he suffered death on the cross ; but they 
rejoiced when the testimony came to them that he was risen, and es- 
pecially when they saw him, when they could feel of him and listen 
to his words. These men went out into the world preaching Christ 
and him crucified. They were not afraid to bear that testimony to 
the world. You might say that twelve men could conspire to tell a 
lie, but we have never heard of a number of men doing so, when they 
were promised only martyrdom and no honor among the people, also 
that they should be brought up before judges, and be jailed and 
scourged for their testimonies — you have never heard of men con- 
spiring together with such a future before them, if that which they 
declared was not true. But they knew it was true. Peter, though he 
did falter once and denied the Savior, was still a brave man. He 
never faltered after Jesus had given him the mission to look after the 
Saints, to feed his lambs and sheep. More than thirty years he con- 
tinued to labor and all the time knowing that Jesus had told him how 



11 



GEN II RAL CO Nl ERE N CE . 



he should die; that he would have to suffer martyrdom. He did not 
say it in those words, but he told him that another should gird him 
and. carry him whither he would not. He alluded to the death which 
Peter would suffer. When it came to the real point, Peter went gladly, 
only he said at the very last moment, according to the legend, that he 
was not worthy to die as the Savior had died on the cross, and he asked 
that he might be crucified with his head down. Of course, this is a 
legendary story that has come to us, but it shows us that he suffered 
death; and his life was given as a witness of the truth that he had 
proclaimed all the way through. 

Paul had been a persecutor of the Saints, but was converted by 
the vision of the Savior on the way to Damascus ; he knew then that 
Jesus of Nazareth, the man who had been crucified, was indeed the 
Son of God, and he bravely continued his labors until at last he too 
gave his life in defense of the truth. These men saw the Savior. 
Thomas, the doubter, was not willing to take the testimony of his 
brethren, the apostles; but Jesus appeared where he was and told 
him to feel of the wounds. Then Thomas declared that he was the 
Lord. He was willing then to believe. Jesus gave him a gentle re- 
buke by saying: "Blessed are those who believe, though they have 
not seen." 

We believe many things that we have not seen, many things that 
have come to us by the Spirit of God, and they have been made as 
plain to us as knowledge obtained by our five senses could be. We 
have received, by the Spirit witnessing to our spirit, the truth of these 
heavenly things that have been given to us. 

THE SAINTS WARNED TO BE FAITHFUL TO THE END. 

Brethren and sisters, let us continue to be faithful, whatever it 
shall cost. Remember the long eternity before us, and that by being 
faithful in keeping the Lord's commandments and keeping our cov^ 
enants, the celestial glory will be obtainable by us. Let us not 
forfeit the great opportunity the Lord has given us, but remember 
that he sees us ; we walk as in his sight, and he knows us. We can- 
not deceive him. Let us walk honestly and uprightly before him and 
then, brethren and sisters, I know that the great object for which we 
are striving shall be obtained by us— an entrance into the celestial 
kingdom and a return to our heavenly Father will be our lot God 
bless you all. Amen. 

Miss Louise Watson, Miss Edna Gothberg, and Lola Edwards 
sang the trio, "Lift Thine Eyes," (Mendelssohn.) 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

There is so little time left that we will not impose on anyone of our 
speakers by asking him to try to concentrate his thoughts and con- 
dense his remarks to occupy the few minutes that remain Perhaps 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT. 23 

I can overrun the time myself without creating much criticism, so I 
will take the time and a few minutes beyond. 

THE "ERA" AND "THE VISION" BY EVAN STEPHENS ENDORSED. 

I hold in my hand the last issue of the Improvement Era. I read it, 
from cover to cover, before it was printed, when it was in proof sheet 
form. I am very grateful to the men and women who have written for 
this number, every article of which refers to the vision given to the 
Prophet Joseph. The words of the sacred historical cantata entitled 
"The Vision," written by Professor Evan Stephens, which will be sung 
here tomorrow night is also recorded in this number. I have requested 
tihe Deseret News to print ten thousand extra copies of this issue 
of the Era. I think that every person who believes in that wonderful 
vision ought to get this number of the Era.

24 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



in the Assembly Hall, on the afternoon of October 5, 1919, and I desire 
to read a few words from that address: 

I was just looking over that wonderful poem, "The Seer," written by 
President John Taylor, that remarkable, splendid father of President Frank 
Y. Taylor who is here today. I find written there, concerning the Prophet 
(oseph, that 

"He shared their joys, their sorrows too, 
He loved the Saints, he loved Nauvoo." 

I have been away from this people long enough to develop a strong love 
for the Saints of God; the good people, who make up the congregations of 
the Church are the dearest people in all the world to you and me. There 
is no experience that touches my heart more deeply than the sight of the 
face of a good old brother or sister whom I have known, and known to be 
faithful for many years. I share their joys and their sorrows too. I deeply 
love the Saints and their asscoiation, and am proud of being a member 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 

I was thinking during the noon hour how much reason we all have 
to be proud of the record of the Church. When you stop to think about it, 
you must conclude that this Church has been right throughout its whole 
history upon all of the important moral questions that have affected our 
welfare. In the nature of things there is not within the United States a 
people more patriotic than the Latter-day Saints. I know of no sect that 
assumes the position that the constitution of the United States was written 
as it were by the very finger of God. Surely that belief is an inspiration to 
the highest patriotism. You remember readng in the history of the Church 
that this people were accused in Missouri of being opposed to slavery. In 
that slave-holding state such an attitude became one of the reasons of our 
persecution and drivings. You remember that the first message that flashed 
across the completed telegraph line from here to the Atlantic ocean was a 
message of congratulation from Brigham Young to Abraham Lincoln that 
the Union was preserved or was in the way of preservation. 

President Grant spoke this morning of the attitude of the Navajo In- 
dians toward the "Mormons." They had confidence in the "Mormon" people 
because the "Mormon" people had never abused their confidence. Books 
have been written, one book that I remember in particular, called "A Cen- 
tury of Dishonor," an indictment covering hundreds of pages against the 
American people for treatment of the American Indians. But no in- 
dictment had ever been framed, or would be formulated against the "Mor- 
mon' 'people for their attitude or treatment of the aborigines of this con- 
tinent. We have always treated them fairly and squarely, as of course they 
should have been treated. 

We have stood square upon women's suffrage. We were among the 
very first — the second, as I now recall it — of the states to give what should 
have been given years before, the right .of equal suffrage to the women, 
now recognized not only in this country but throughout the world as a long 
delayed measure of justice. 

We have stood fairly and squarely upon the prohibition question 
throughout the Church. 

IN MEMORY OF OSBORNE J. P. WIDTSOE. 

Since our last conference, one of our greatest educators has 
passed away, Osborne J. P. Widtsoe. One of the splendid articles in 
this April number of the Improvement Era was from the pen of our de- 
parted brother, and I will read the last paragraph or two : 

But while it is well it is not enough. Steadily to maintain the narrow 
way throughout the generations, there must needs be communion with the 
director of all. Where there is no revelation, the people perish; they wander 



PR IIS I DENT HEBER J. GRANT. 



25 



from paths cf rectitude; they deny even that which has given them life. 
This, then, is the sum of all: Not alone because the doctrines revealed 
through Joseph the Prophet spurs the energies of man to work, and to know, 
and to do; nor yet alone because it is based on the law of association, will 
it thrive and prosper; but because there is added hereto the still more basic 
principle of faith in God and his power to guide man by continued revela- 
tion — as times and seasons and countries shall require — will ultimate 
triumph be achieved. The far-reaching extent of the work of the Prophet 
Joseph Smith cannot be declared; the monument he has erected to his mem- 
ory cannot be measured. But this much is certain: It is as natural as that 
the rising sun shall appear in the east to spread its glory graduallv over 
the world, that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints should 
prosper and progress to come ultimately to inherit the earth. 

THEY GAVE THEIR LIVES FOR SERVICE TO THE PEOPLE. 

Richard W. Young offered his life twice, by volunteering in the 
service of his country, going once to the Philippine Islands, and once to 
France. Osborne Widtsoe gave his life to the service of the Church and 
for the uplift, educationally, of the people. The lives of these two 
noble men stand as a testimony to the divinity of this work. No more 
upright clean men ever drew the breath of life. We thank God for 
the record that they have left and pray God to bless and comfort their 
families and to assist them to walk in that straight and narrow path 
in which their fathers walked. May God's comforting influence be 
and abide with them and with all those who have been called upon to 
mourn, since we were last here, is my prayer and I ask it in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The anthem, "Oh, Happy is the Man," by Prof. J. J. McClellan, 
words by Parley P. Pratt, was sung by the choir. 

The closing prayer was offered by Elder John L. Herrick, former 
President of the Western States Mission. 



AFTERNOON SESSION 

President Heber J. Grant presided and called the congregation 
to order at 2 o'clock. The house was filled to capacity. Overflow 
meetings were held in the Assembly Hall and in the Bureau of In- 
formation. 

The choir and congregation sang, "The Spirit of God like a fire 
is burning." 

Prayer was offered by Elder German E. Ellsworth, former 
President of the Northern States Mission. 

The choir sang, "Hallelujah to the Father (Beethoven's "Mount 
of Olives").

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE 

I am very thankful for this privilege. Just to look at this congrega- 
tion is a pleasure and a treat. To be called upon to speak — I was 
going to say — is a task, and it really is, for I do not feel prepared to 
deliver a discourse upon any particular topic or subject. But I feel 
thankful that I am able to be here, and to lift up my voice once more 
in testimony of the truth. I bear testimony that what we heard this 
morning, that which was delivered from this stand, was true, divinely 
revealed and divinely spoken. I felt like shouting and singing, "Hal- 
lelujah, Praise to God," when President Grant closed his remarks: for 
I felt that he was inspired of God to give to us words in due season : 
and I believe the whole congregation, thii immense audience, 
was thrilled with the same feeling and spirit. I enjoy preaching of 
that kind. I do enjoy a well said discourse, prepared already in i 
thought and in language to deliver to a public assembly, but I must 
say that I do much more enjoy addresses that are delivered by the 
power of God, accompanied by that splendid spirit which came to us 
all when we first embraced the gospel. When we first heard the 
glad tidings of salvation brought to earth in the latter days through 
the Prophet Joseph Smith and his associates, our whole souls thrilled 
with joy, with thanksgiving and praise to the Lord: and no matter 
how often we heard the same simple truths declared, we enjoyed the 
hearing of them, and the same spirit that rested upon the speakers 
rested upon the hearers, so we rejoiced together. I felt that this morn- 
ing, as I have many times during the conferences that we have held 
in years that are past, and I was impressed with the feeling that the 
promise made by the Almighty in regard to the continuance of his 
work, was verily true, and will be fulfilled to the uttermost, no mat- 
ter what may occur, no matter what changes may come, either through 
the martyrdom of our prophet or the decease of our leaders, by what 
we call "natural means." No matter what the opposition may be in 
the world, though thrones may totter, empires fall, and the systems 
of men may be broken up and perish, the Church and Kingdom of our 
God shall continue and abide and increase. 

THE CHURCH OF CHRIST SHALL GROW AND PREVAIL. 

This great audience, this afternoon, is evidence of the truth of 
the prediction of the Prophet Joseph Smith, addressing his father by 
revelation, which was read to us this morning. This work will abide. 
It was so destined by the Almighty, when he revealed it. When he 
appeared with his Son Jesus Christ, our Redeemer, to the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, he ordained and declared that this organization should 
remain on the earth, and should not be broken to pieces, nor given to 
any people except to the Saints of the Most High, and they should 
continue the work and possess the Kingdom and the greatness of the 
Kingdom until it should spread forth under the whole heavens. 

I know that this is true, and I felt the influence and spirit of it 



PRESIDENT CHARLES //'. PENROSE.

this morning", when I looked upon the great congregation here, and 
realized that another large audience of Saints was gathered in the 
Assembly Hall, and that there was a great number of inspired men, 
ready at the word, when they receive it from the head, to go forth 
to the nations, or to labor at home, to do anything and everything 
required of them under the power and influence of the Spirit of the 
Lord which they hold, associated with their offices and callings in 
the holy Priesthood. 

It is a joy to my heart to realize and know this, that the work shall 
not be broken up, shall not be given to another people, but this Church 
and Kingdom — for the terms are used almost synonymously — shall 
continue and stand forth and overcome every opposition of every kind 
that may come against it. I do not say this in the spirit of defiance 
against the powers of darkness, either in the flesh or out of the flesh, 
but I say it in humility, and with full confidence that the word of 
God shall be fulfilled, and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints shall continue and abide, and the gdspel it brings shall be 
preached to the living and to the dead, until all of the race of Adam, 
who are able to receive and hear, shall hear the word and have the 
free opportunity and liberty, if they will, to obey it, to repent of their 
sins, and to come unto God the Eternal Father, be obedient to him, 
and bow the knee to King Tmmanuel, Jesus the Christ. 

THE VISION OF JOSEPH. 

We have reminders, frequently now, of the fact that about a cen- 
tury has elapsed since the time when the Prophet Joseph, as a boy, 
went into a grove near his father's residence — where many of us 
have been, and have rejoiced in the spirit we found there — and there 
for the first time in vocal prayer — I presume he had prayed before, 
in a fashion — but in vocal prayer, from the heart, with faith, he called 
upon the Lord that he might learn which was the true religion. As 
we have heard today, and have heard many times before, the Father 
and the Son appeared to him. He saw them; they were there be- 
fore him. We may not perhaps exactly explain how and by what 
means Joseph saw the Father and the Son. He called it a vision. 
That is right, it was a vision. But what is a vision of that kind? A 
vision like that which Moses had when he saw the Lord face to face. 
He saw the Father and spoke to him, and the Lord spoke to him. 
Moses declared that he saw him, not with his natural eyes, but with 
his spiritual vision : and that there is such a thing I presume many 
of us who are here are fully assured. We know it in our own ex- 
perience, but not perhaps to the same degree as Joseph or Moses had 
it, when they conversed with the Lord. Rut that there is a spiritual 
sight or vision we realize, and we can draw very near to our Father 
and our God in the name of Jesus Christ, and see when others are 
in the dark, and comprehend when others are blinded in regard to 
the heavenly truths which come to people from him for their salva- 
tion.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



VIRTUE IN THE PRAYER OF FAITH. 

I rejoice in the knowledge of this great truth, and I know that 
there is virtue in the prayer of faith. It is the prayer of faith that 
saves the sick wnen we administer to them in the way that is ap- 
pointed. The real efficacious prayer must be accompanied by faith, 
which is the strength and power of it ; and by faith we can draw 
near to him who is our living Head. And by faith we can accomplish 
the work set us to do, no matter what it may be. If we put our souls 
in it, and in faith attempt the work that we are entrusted with, in 
that we shall succeed. In God we trust: in God we have faith; 
on God we rely : and when we do that with full purpose of heart, the 
Lord, and the powers behind the veil are with us. The heavenly power 
of the Priesthood is with us who hold it here in the flesh, and it is by 
that power that we shall prevail and succeed and overcome, and ac- 
complish the great work of salvation entrusted to us. 

ALL THINGS TO BE DONE IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST. 

Everything in this Church is to be done in the name of Jesus 
Christ ; so we have been commanded. This Church is -called "The 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-dav Saints." That was given by 
revelation and commandment. It is not merely the Church of man : 
and though men are called of God to work in it, and to occupy prom- 
inent places in it, and to use great influence in building it up, we 
are building it up to him who is our living Head, even Jesus' the 
Christ. We are to do all things in his name. When Peter was in- 
strumental in curing the lame man by the gate of the temple, he said : 
Silver and gold have I none, but such as I have, give I unto thee : 
in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk;" and the 
man leaped and walked. And so it shall be with this Church, which 
Jesus Christ has established in the latter days. It shall prevail and 
overcome every obstacle in the path. 

wp No w , concerning that name: It is the name of Jesus Christ that 
we are to use. I will read a verse or two from the Doctrine and Cov- 

convlv J' T l ° n u T here are a mimber of othei " sections that 
convey the same idea, but I will not take time to read them. I will 
begin with the 21st verse:

at the table, (or ask a blessing upon it) they do it in a sort of peculiar, 
hurried manner, and close it by saying rapidly, "In the name of Jesus. 
Amen." When some men dismiss a meeting they are in haste to pro- 
nounce the benediction, and they do it "in the name of Jesus. Amen." 
There are many men in the world named "Jesus" in these latter days. 
I was reading in a newspaper recently about a murderer whose first 
name was Jesus, who crucified his own child. He was a fanatic, a 
madman. I notice, too, when you travel, in many foreign countries 
you find over the doors the names of men who keep what we call 
"saloons" or public houses, and it is Jesus So-and-so. Now, we are 
to take upon us the name of Christ, and you will find, if you will 
read the Pearl of Great Price, in the revelation of God to Enoch and 
to Moses 52, 57, that it is specified there, particularly, that Jesus 
Christ is the name of "a righteous judge who shall come," and that 
he is the beloved of the Father, that he is the firstborn of the Father; 
he is the beloved Son, and when speaking in regard to the future in 
the flesh he is called "the Only Begotten" Son. God's only Begotten 
Son is Jesus Christ — Jesus, the Savior, Christ the anointed. The 
two names go together, and they belong to each other. Jesus Christ 
lias said that is the name he received from the Father, and we are 
to use that name. When we baptize, we baptize in the name of Jesus 
Christ : "Having authority from Jesus Christ, I baptize you," and 
so on. So when we pronounce the blessing upon the sacrament, the 
bread or the water, we ask the Father, in the name of his Son Jesus 
Christ, to bless the bread or to bless the water. So, my brethren, in 
administering in any of the ordinances of the house of God, it is to 
be done in the name of Jesus Christ. 

Do not be afraid to use reverently the name of Christ. He uses 
it continually. We can read about it in the Book of Mormon. The 
Church was the Church of Christ, and in the last days the Church 
is to be called by that name. You may think perhaps that is a matter 
of little importance. Perhaps it is so to you ; but I have found in my 
experience, from the beginning of my membership in this Church, 
that there is power in that name. "In my name they that believe shall 
cast out devils ; they shall speak with new tongues," and so on. There 
is power in the name of Jesus Christ. Demons tremble at that name. 
They recognize it. But when we, in a slip-shod way, use the name 
of Jesus, and say nothing about Christ, I don't know that it has so 
much power and influence. The Lord may in mercy to our omission 
accept our meaning, but never mind about that, Let us do what we 
are told to do, and administer in the way that Jesus Christ himself 
says we are to adminis f °r. I will not take time to read from other 
sections, that relate to the same subject, but all the revelations in this 
book [the Doc. and Cov.] given through the Prophet, or to others, 
are in the name of Jesus Christ, He says: "Listen to the voice of 
Jesus Christ, the great I Am, whose arm of mercy hath atoned for 
your sins." (See Sections 29, 38, 39 and others.) He is the Great I 
Am spoken of in the Hebrew scriptures.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



JEHOVAH OF THE OLD TESTAMENT IS JESUS CHRIST OF THE NEW. 

He is the Jehovah spoken of in the Old Testament. Jesus Christ 
of the New Testament, is Jehovah of the Old Testament, and he so 
proclaimed it when he came to the Prophet Joseph and Oliver Cow- 
dery in the temple of the Lord, the account of which we read in the 
110th section of the Doctrine and Covenants. They speak of his ap- 
pearance, the glorious appearance and power, and his voice was 
like the rush of many waters. It was the voice of Jehovah. I say 
this for the benefit of some few of my friends who do not believe in 
the doctrine that Jesus of the New Testament was Jehovah of the 
Old Testament. Jesus the Christ represents the Father fully. In 
him dwelleth the fulness of the Godhead bodily, as we read in the 
scriptures. "It pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell." 
And so he could tell Philip, when asked, "Lord, show us the Father :" 
"Llave I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known 
me, Philip? He that hath seen me hath seen the Father." God was 
manifest in the flesh, in the personality of Jesus of Nazareth, and he 
was verily the Son of God, begotten of the Father, and his mother was 
the virgin Mary. There should be no dispute in regard to this matter, 
because it has been made so clear and full in the revelations of God 
to us. 

THE TRINITY, THREE DISTINCT PERSONALITIES. 

There is a trinity in the Godhead, so the Prophet Joseph taught — 
the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, — and they are three distinct 
personalities in perfect unity. There is a spirit which "proceedeth from 
the presence of God throughout the immensity of space," the light 
which is in all things, and through all things, and round about all 
things, and the law by "which all things are governed." By that spirit, 
our Heavenly Father declares, he created all things in the beginning, 
firstly spiritually, and afterwards temporally. Doc. and Cov. Sec. 29. 

We learn also that this spirit of truth and intelligence and power 
proceedeth from the Deity, "throughout the immensity of space, and is 
the law, by which all things are governed, by which God is omnipres- 
ent, by which the word of God is declared, whether through Jesus the 
Christ, or by the personality of the Holy Ghost. That spirit per- 
vadeth all things. The Word is declared through and by its influ- 
ence in all the worlds that God has created. We should understand 
the distinction between this universally diffused essence, and the 
personality called the Holy Ghost, whom Jesus Christ said he would 
send to his disciples, and who no doubt came on the Day of Pentecost, 
in person. 

These may seem small matters to some, but we should try and 
get right on all things, that we may have the unity of the faith, that 
there may be no discord among us. 

WHAT IS TRUTH ? 

The spirit of truth reveals truth, conveys the light of truth. It 
conveys intelligence. What is intelligence? It is "the light of truth." 



PR HS I DENT CHARLES W. PUN ROSE. 



31 



I was pleased when President Grant read the concluding verse of 
Brother Jaques' splendid hymn, where it says, "Truth, the sum of ex- 
istence, shall weather the worst." All the hymn is eulogistic of that 
divine influence that we call truth. 

Oh say, what is truth? 'tis the fail est gem 
That the riches of worlds can produce, 

and so on. But here it tells something about what it is. It is "the 
sum of existence" — things past, things present, and things to come, 
facts. These are truth, and the Lord says that "truth is knowledge, 
of things as they are and as they were, and as they are to come." (Sec. 
93.) Some of our brethren in writing, and a good many in talking, say 
truth is the knowledge, or a knowledge of thing's. That is some- 
thing that you can have or I can have or can reject. The insertion of 
a or the is a mistake. Truth is knowledge itself, information, intelli- 
gence, things that are, things that were, things that are to come — knowl- 
edge concerning them. That is truth. It is a splendid definition and 
answers the question of ages more clearly than anything I have 
ever heard attempted ; even better than "truth the sum of existence," 
and yet the two in meaning are identical. Now, let us be correct in 
that little thing, and so in all things that pertain to our doctrines, our 
duties in the Priesthood, brethren, and in our quotations of scripture 
let us try to be right, as nearly correct as we can. 

i 

THE NATURE AND RESURRECTION OF CHRIST. 

This day, as Brother Lund so plainly pointed out to us, is called 
th*e anniversary of the resurrection of Jesus Christ, our Redeemer. 
I do not know whether it is exactly the right day, and it does not 
matter. It is something like it is with Christmas Day. We join with 
the Christian world, as they please to call themselves, in revering the 
name of Jesus Christ, and celebrating his resurrection. We claim that 
he actually was raised from the dead ; not merely continued his exist- 
ence' after death, but the body that was put into the sepulchre was 
brought forth from the tomb, and nothing was left but the napkin and 
other things that were placed around it when the body was interred. 
He appeared to his disciples, and to many others, five hundred breth- 
ren we are told. They do not give us their written testimony, but it 
is given in the New Testament. They all saw him at once, and he dis- 
coursed with them, and showed his disciples his hands and his feet. 
What for? To deceive them? To make them think something that 
was not true? Not at all. He wanted them to understand that that 
was the body that was on the cross, in which the Roman soldiers drove 
the spikes or nails through the hands and through the feet. He ex- 
hibited himself, and told them to handle him and see, "For a spirit," 
said he, "hath not flesh and bones as ye see me have." Many of the 
apostles lost their lives because they testified concerning this fact. 
They were witnesses of the resurrection, the raising from the dead 
of the body of the Redeemer, quickened by the spirit, immortalized, 



32 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



beautified, made glorious ; -but the changes wrought upon it that it 
might be immortal did not change the structure of the body. It was 
the body of Jesus, the Christ, who hung upon the cross, and died for 
the sins of the world. And that is the great truth that we have to 
declare, not only his actual resurrection from the dead, but that he 
is the Savior; through him and by him and of him, the Father declared, 
the worlds were created and made. We know little about his actual 
life on the earth during the three years that he labored in the ministry, 
and still less about his childhood, and we know next to nothing 
concerning the details of his preexistenoe, except the fact of it. He 
was with the Father in the beginning; he says so in revelation to us, 
in the 93rd section of the Doctrine and Covenants : "I also was in the 
beginning with the Father, and am the Firstborn." Now, do not be 
deceived, any of you, by speculations that people have had about his 
being "the son of Adam," and other theoretical notions. He was the 
Firstborn of the Father, as we read in the Epistle to the Hebrews. 
"When he bringeth his Firstbegotten into the world, he saith, let all the 
angels of God worship him," Jesus the Christ, whose spirit, whose light 
is in all the worlds that have been created, and is "the power by which 
they were made." He was the Firstborn of the great family to which 
we belong, so we call him not only our Redeemer, but our Elder 
Brother. 

Well, some ask, did he have a beginning? Certainly, in his in- 
dividuality. He had no beginning in the essence that composes his 
spiritual personality. Neither is he, in that, different from us. We 
also, he says, were in the beginning with the Father, that which is 
spirit, God says that he created them all. But doesn't he say that 
intelligence never was created or made? Yes. But what is intelli- 
gence? I have quoted to you that "intelligence is the light of truth," 
without beginning, without end: But "intelligences" are individuals 
begotten of the Father, created, he says, by him, or organized; and 
whether you use the term "created" or "organized" or "begotten," it 
means the same thing. They were his sons and his daughters. But 
Christ Jesus was the Firstborn, and so he is preeminent in all things, 
and all things will become, some time, subject to him, and every knee 
will bow and every tongue confess that Jesus is the Christ, to the 
glory of God the Father. 

Let us get this clearly in our minds, and we will find that there 
are no contradictions in the scriptures of the Lord. Intelligence is 
without beginning. It is something that can be imparted or withheld. 
It is the light of truth, and it proceeds from the Father, and is con- 
veyed to us if we will open our hearts to receive it, and we will receive 
its gifts according to our organization and capacities and the blessings 
of God to us. It is the spirit by which God made the worlds, by which 
he governs them, by which he is present in them and round about 
them, and the fulness of it is in Jesus the Christ, his Only Begotten in 
the flesh, and his Firstborn in the spirit. 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. PENROSE. 33 



THANKS BE TO GOD FOR THE GIFT OF HIS SON JESUS CHRIST. 

We desire to praise Jesus our Redeemer. Oh, what a blessing was 
his crucifixion to all the world, to all generations of the sons and 
daughters of Adam ; by and through him and his atonement we can 
be redeemed from the dead, from death, from hell, from darkness, 
from the grave, from everything that is hurtful and injurious and that 
brings unhappiness. And we can be imbued with his Spirit if we obey 
his gospel, and be able to draw near unto him, and to realize who 
and what he is, for a fact, for ourselves. For he will reveal himself 
to us if we will draw near unto him. To use a figurative expression 
that he used to his disciples ; he will come in with us and sup with us 
and be in us and round about us, and be our leader and our guide. 
Thanks be to God the eternal Father! Hallelujah, praise his holy 
name, for the gift of his Son Jesus Christ, for the redemption of man- 
kind from the transgression of Adam, who is our earthly head. He is 
our father in that sense, the father of all the race. We have had 
fathers of our flesh, we have obeyed them, and so the chain goes up 
to the great man who stood at the head, the father of all, Adam. But 
our Father whom we worship is the great Elohim, who sits on high, 
who is working, through his Son Jesus Christ, for our redemption, and 
he is the Savior, after all, of all that are saved. Through and by his 
Son Jesus Christ are we redeemed from our own sins and also 
from the sin of our first parents, the transgression of Adam and 
Eve in the garden. He who knew no sin offered himself as a sacri- 
fice for those who had sinned, and that reaches right back to Adam. 
It is through Jesus the Christ that Adam is redeemed from the ef- 
fects of the fall, and through him we are redeemed from death and hell 
and the grave, from our own sins as well as from the sin committed 
by our first parents. By obedience to his commandments we vcan be 
washed clean from our sins and imperfections, but it is the blood of 
Jesus Christ which cleanseth from all sin. Thanks be to God, I say, 
for this great gift unto us ! 

Let us try to understand the word of the Lord. It is not partic- 
ularly necessary that we should spend all our time thinking on these 
ideas and theories, but there is value in them because they are true, 
and it is the truth that will save. Jesus prayed to the Father to 
sanctify his disciples. "Sanctify them by the truth, thy word is truth ;" 
and by his wofd we can obtain knowledge of things that are past or 
present or are to come, and can be in harmony with the Father and 
with the Son and with the Holy Ghost, and with all the great and 
mighty beings who held authority from them in the ages that are 
past, and those who have held it in the dispensation in which we live, 
those who are living, and those who have passed away. What a glori- 
ous kingdom there will be, when sin is banished, when darkness is 
dispersed, when false governments will perish ; when the true King- 
dom of God shall be set up, and Jesus Christ as King of kings and 
Lord of lords shall reign over all the earth ; and those who obey his 
commandments will reign with him in glory. The Saints of olden 



34 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



days and the Saints of modem days will be together there in that 
great company. There will be no disunion ; there will be no darkness ; 
there will be no pain, and there will be no more death, but we shall 
live, and live because of the atonement wrought out for us by Jesus 
Christ, our Redeemer. We shall be there, as be will be there, as 
distinct individual personalities. 

THE GLORY AWAITING THE RIGHTEOUS. 

We shall not be blended into one body, except as an organization 
of people. Each one will be himself or herself, and will shine in the 
glory of our Father ; and every quality that we have, every attribute, 
every gift and power of our being that we have obtained from our 
birthright from our Father, all the knowledge we have gained by our 
experiences in the spirit life or in mortality will be ours, and the 
power of endless lives will be in us, because the spirit and the body 
will be inseparably joined together in glory, never more to be sep- 
arated, and all eternity will be before us in which to progress and 
improve and rejoice, and find out more about our Father and Jesus 
Christ, our Elder Brother, the great Mediator and Exemplar, whom 
we are to follow always, and joy will be made supreme and per- 
fect. In this life we only have it imperfectly, for the body without 
the spirit cannot receive a fulness of joy, neither can the spirit without 
the body. The elements of both are eternal, but each of us has an 
individual personality. When we were born in the spirit, that was our 
first estate. Now we are in our second estate, and when the third 
estate comes, if we have been faithful in both, and obtained this great 
blessing of the spirit and the body joined together in one, in perfec- 
tion, in complete harmony with the Father and with the Son and with 
the Holy Ghost, and all the great and mighty and just and pure 
and honest of heart of all the centuries into one great kingdom and 
glory, oh, how happy we shall be in shouting "Hallelujah to his holy 
Name !" 

CLOSING INJUNCTION TO FAITHFULNESS. • 

I feel that I can do that this afternoon, echoing the anthem by the 
choir. I do not want to take up too much' time. Perhaps I have talked 
too long already. There are a number of brethren here whom all the 
people want to hear. I rejoice with them and glorify God to know 
that the organization of this Church has been fully established. 
Study the 107th Section of the Doctrine and Covenants, elders of 
Israel. Read it carefully from beginning to end. Weigh every phrase 
in it, and see the beauty of that organization of Priesthood which 
the Lord has set up, and, so far, has perfected. Live as servants and 
priests of the Most High God, perform your duties, and set a good 
example. Take the hint given to you this morning by Brother Lund 
in regard to your tithing. We learn from President Grant of the 
immense amount of money that is being expended and that which is 
called for. Oh, if all the Latter-day Saints could realize what a bless- 
ing there is in the payment of their tithes, honestly, — which means a

tenth ; it does not mean a fifth nor a twentieth, it is the tenth, the 
tenth of our interest before the Lord, — if they would do that we 
would have no difficulty in complying with the requests that are 
coming in by the hundreds every clay of our lives there in the office — 
for appropriations for different objects that are very good, but there 
are'not means enough now to comply with the demands. 

If all the servants of God, high priests, seventies, elders, and the 
members of the lesser Priesthood, would obey that commandment 
of Jesus Christ, that is, to pay their tenth, and the means come into the 
hands of the servants of God, who are honestly and faithfully and 
patiently striving to use it and distribute it to bring about the best re- 
sults, what a blessing it would be to them individually, for they 
would grow in grace and in the knowledge of the truth, and have con- 
fidence in God when they pray, and it would be an example to the 
Saints and be a blessing to the Church to which we belong, this splen- 
did organization that God has set up to continue an,d abide. Faith- 
ful and true should be those who have received the authority of the 
holy Priesthood, honest and pure in their dealings with one another, 
and in their dealings with the Lord. 

•The tithing is called "a voluntary contribution." But what should 
that be? It should be a tenth, just as the Lord has commanded. And 
so, of course, in regard to all other duties in the Church. That is not 
the only one, by any means. Every one of us Latter-day Saints 
should endeavor to be a member of the Church in the full sense of the 
word, baptized into Christ, having put on Christ, trying to carry 
out the commandments of Jesus Christ, trying to live in the spirit 
of Jesus Christ, so that we shall not be ashamed when we stand up 
.in the midst of that great concourse in judgment, and behold the 
face of our Redeemer, and realize that he is indeed what he has 
been proclaimed to be. Let us be members of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints in the full sense of the word, and use our 
talents and abilities, such as they are, in the service of the Lord, and 
we will find the truth of his promise : "Behold I come. My reward 
is with me, but my work is before me." Do your work, Israel, and 
gain the reward through Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The duet "God With Us" was sung by James H. Nielson, tenor, 
and Raymond Williams, baritone. 

ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 

I rejoice, my brethren and sisters, in the testimonies that have 
been borne during the sessions of this conference, and am very happy, 
for in my heart there are, today, feelings of gratitude to our Father 
in heaven that I also know that that which the brethren have testi- 
fied to is true. 

WHY LATTER-DAY SAINTS ARE POSITIVE IN THEIR RELIGIOUS 
DECLARATIONS. 

It undoubtedly seems a very positive position for us to take, to 



36 



GENERAL CONEERENCE. 



be able to speak with such certainty concerning the work the Lord 
is doing in the world, in our day; to speak with such certainty con- 
cerning the visitation the prophet Joseph Smith received a hundred 
years ago, wherein the Father and the Son actually appeared to him. 
We may impress our friends, by reason of our positive position, with 
arrogance, but that is not the thought that is in our hearts. We 
know what we know, and we testify to it in earnestness and in hu- 
mility. I remember a gentleman, a minister, said on one occasion, 
in a private discussion which I had with him, that he thought we 
were too positive about the things of religion. He thought we had 
not considered the question of God enough to be able to speak with 
such certainty. He informed me that he belonged to a church that 
was several hundred years older than the one to which I belonged, 
and he said that his church had been considering these questions for 
a long time and had altered their view and their opinion about a 
good many theological questions. I granted that that was true ; and he 
ventured the assertion that after we had been discussing these theo- 
logical questions as long as they had, perhaps we would change our 
opinion also. And in order to establish his point he used this illus- 
tration : 

"If you had a problem to give for solution and you selected ten 
boys to solve the problem, and you gave one of them ten days in which 
to study it, and then another boy nine days and still another boy eight, 
and so forth, until you had one boy studying on the problem but one 
day and one studying ten days; now which boy, at the conclusion of 
the ten days, would know most about the problem, the one who had 
been studying but one day or the one who had studied ten days?" 

Well, you would have to concede, as I did, that if all things 
were equal, of course, the boy that had been studying ten days ought 
to know most about the problem. 

"Well, there you are," he said; "we have been studying it longer 
than you have, and you are one of the youngest churches, and so you 
are likely to change your mind when you study it a little longer." 

"But," I said, "suppose the boy who has had the problem but 
one day receives the visit of a professor who knows all about the 
problem and who illustrates it so that now it is perfectly clear to 
the mind of the boy, who knows most about it, the boy who has thus 
been aided, only having had the chance to study it one day, or the 
boy who has been dreaming about it for ten days ?" 

_ "Why," he said, "of course, the boy who was thus aided and 
assisted knew most about the problem." 

Then I said: "That is exactly where we stand." Joseph Smith 
did not know, because of earthly wisdom and his reading of the 
scriptures, more about our Father in heaven and his Son Jesus Christ, 
than the learned ministers of the world. Not by that means did he 
obtain his knowledge, but in the few moments that he knelt in the 
sacred grove in the presence of the Father and the Son he knew more 
about God the eternal Father and his Son Jesus Christ than all the 
ministers of all the world ever have known, or ever will know, except 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 



37 



they shall be, in like manner, informed and instructed. So that the wis- 
dom he had came to him from the source to which men must go if 
they shall know our Father in heaven. 

While we speak with this certainty and this positiveness, we 
desire to be charitable to our brethren and sisters who have not this 
faith. I think of their condition with a feeling- of almost pity and 
sorrow. I realize that among them are many who desire to do right, 
who do right so far as they have knowledge, who are blinded be- 
cause of the traditions of their fathers, who have ears but hear not, 
eyes and see not, and hearts that can not understand. We have 
not read the scriptures and obtained this superior knowledge because 
of our increased intelligence. If we should sweep away the knowl- 
edge that has come to the Latter-day Saints in the revelations con- - 
tained in the book of Doctrine and Covenants, in the revelations we 
have conoerning the great plan of salvation, as revealed in the Book 
of Mormon, and other inspired utterances that have fallen from the 
lips of the prophets of God from the days of Joseph until this day, — 
if we should sweep those away, and have nothing but the fragmentary 
utterances of the Lord Jesus Christ and his apostles, as found in 
the scriptures, left, we would not know any better than others the 
truth concerning the gospel of Jesus Christ, nor the plan of church 
organization. 

Just at this time the whole Christian world is considering the 
question of a unity of churches, acknowledging that the system that 
has produced division is wrong, and makes for weakness and not for 
strength. Now, how in the world will they ever unite, except that 
which is lost shall come again? Their lamentable condition has 
been produoed because men have not preserved, from the days of 
the Redeemer's ministry among his servants on the earth, the truth 
Jesus taught. When we think of his three years of ministry it must 
have amounted to hundreds of sermons, hours in length, in which 
he discoursed upon all the fundamental truths of the gospel. There 
evidently was no question in the minds of his followers as to what 
they should do to be saved, but the difficulty with the present sit- 
uation is that we have but a fragment of what he uttered. If you 
should combine all the several narratives, as they are found in the 
Gospels, into one narrative and eliminate the duplication of the story, 
it is said that it could be read in an hour and fifteen minutes and 
would constitute but seventeen pages of our scripture. That is a 
very small part of the great message which the Master delivered to 
men. No wonder the world is in confusion and some believe in wor- 
shiping on the seventh day and others disagree with that opinion and 
each seems to find some scripture to justify his position. No wonder 
there is doubt and uncertainty concerning the subject of baptism, 
concerning the form and the manner of it, because the details con- 
cerning that doctrine have not been preserved ; and likewise con- 
cerning the organization of the church. It is true that the names of 
prophets and apostles and pastors and teachers occur in the sacred 
record, but the duties of each are not so well defined ; the work and 



38 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the labor and the relative position of these several officers are not set 
forth so that men can work out again or reestablish, without further 
knowledge, the true organization of the Church of Christ. When I 
think of the contention of our Protestant brethren, that the world 
had gone into idolatry and had lost the truth, and that a state of apos- 
tasy existed up to the time of the Reformation, I cannot blame these 
men. It seems to me that there ought to be rejoicing among those who 
belong to the Protestant cause that there is proof of the truthfulness 
of their contention found in the. utterances of the Lord Jesus Christ 
to Joseph Smith, who verified what those great reformers had been 
declaring, namely, that there was an apostasy and the truth was not 
in the earth. What has happened, from the time they took their 
stand and made these positive declarations, that gives evidence that 
the truth which had been lost was restored? For they themselves con- 
fessed it did not exist in the earth. None of them claimed that an 
angel had visited them and restored the Priesthood ; none of them 
claimed to have received any new word from the Lord clarifying 
the situation, and making the doctrines of the church now plain and 
simple, so that the way-faring man, though a fool, need not err 
therein. 

I wish we had all that Jesus uttered. I believe it would be per- 
fectly easy to make it plain to the minds of men who are honest that 
there has been a departure from the gospel as Jesus established it, 
and that they themselves ane going at cross purposes to the plan 
he devised. Why don't we have more of that which Jesus 
spoke? Simply because years elapsed before some men wrote what they 
could remember of the sermons, or the substance of the sermons, of 
Christ ; and it was only a very brief account ; after all, precious as it 
is, very meagre and not sufficient to guide all men to a common 
understanding of the gospel. Every word that fell from the lips 
of the Master was essential ; not one word was idle, not one word 
was useless, but every word was essential for the salvation of men ; 
and "Mormonism" proclaims to the world that that which has been 
lost has come again, and until that which has been lost does come 
again the world will continue to be in darkness and in ignorance of 
the truth ; and not until men shall go to the Source that Joseph Smith 
applied to himself, when on bended knee he sought the Lord to know 
which of all the denominations was right, shall they know the 
truth. Not until all men shall acknowledge that that and that alone 
is the Source from whence light and knowledge must come, can the 
world come to a unity of the faith. Until that day we shall find 
the world wandering in darkness, hither and thither, seeking light, 
but can not find it, their eyes being blinded. O how the world ought 
to rejoice that in this day that which so long has been lost has been 
restored, the fulness of the gospel, the power and authority of the 
holy Priesthood, the doctrines of the Church, and not only that but 
the organization of the Church as well in its perfection and in its 
power. When I think of the efforts of men to rebuild the Church, 
— and I do not want to belittle their efforts — I do not blame them. I 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD

believe that Joseph Smith and his associates could not have done 
any better than Martin Luther, nor than Wesley or others, except for 
the fact that the Lord revealed himself to him. So I do not belittle the 
efforts of these men who did the best they could with the light and 
knowledge which they had, but their knowledge was limited. 
Their effort to rebuild' and establish the Church of Christ reminds 
me of the experience I had with my first watch. I wanted to see 
what it was made of, so I took it to pieces, and I had so many wheels 
that when I tried to put it together again I could not get all those 
wheels within that case. I put in as many as I could and it looked like a 
watch all right; but it did not serve the purpose for which a watch 
is made, to keep the time. Every wheel was important and necessary 
And so men have tried to fix up a church. They have read of numer- 
ous officers, apostles, and prophets and pastors, but they could not fit 
them together. They just took a few officers — like I did with t v e 
wheels of my watch — and made it look like a church, with a deacon 
arid an elder, or an elder and a priest. It might seem like a church, 
but it was as useless to accomplish the thing for which the Church 
of Christ was established, as my watch was useless without its import- 
ant wheels, each one fitting into the other ; for it is said of old that the 
head could not say to the foot : "I have no need of thee ;" but every of- 
ficer in his place for his purpose, for the work of the ministry, for the 
perfection of the Saints. 

These, our Christian brethren, have done the best they could, but 
they have failed, and it remained for the Lord to build his Church 
again. No man can do it. He is a Master Builder and he has sent his 
inspired servants who have taught men the plan and the pattern of 
the organization of his Church and have fitted in these officers, so 
that, while the "Mormon" Church is admired and even envied by 
those opposed to us, as the most wonderful organization in the world, 
the most wonderful part of it is that it works, and that it does not 
become a machine that easily gets out of joint or kilter, but it works 
forward for the material salvation of the people as well as for their 
{spiritual salvatiqn. Men may duplicate the organization of this 
Church and when they have done it, when they have fitted in the of- 
ficers and given them their appointed places, still they shall have a 
dead thing. You may establish a perfect system of electric lighting 
in this building or this city, you may have your dynamo, you may 
have your wires running through the streets, properly insulated, your 
poles and everything complete, and the globes here, but you can have 
no light, and no power, until through your perfect system there runs 
light and power and heat. And so you may have a perfect church 
organization, but it will be perfectly dead and useless unless, going 
through it, there is the power of the living God, which is the source 
of life and light to his Church. We have the perfect system and it 
has, radiating through it, the power of the living God, the authority 
of the holy Priesthood, and the ordinances thus performed are effi- 
cacious and valid for men on the earth and remain sealed upon their 
heads through their faithfulness, even into the eternal world.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



THE GLORY OF THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST. 

I rejoice in the testimonies that we have listened to on this Easter 
Sabbath day, with respect to the resurrection of the Redeemer, and 
when I think of his ascension from the grave, I rejoice to know that 
He is the Life and that he is the Way. And when I think also of 
removing that last act in the great drama of his life, his coming forth 
from the tomb- — remove that and you take away the crowning glory 
of the ministry of the Redeemer. Had the stone not been rolled 
away and had he not risen from the dead, then it would have been 
exceedingly difficult for men to have had the faith in him they now 
have. He had power in his life over disease that the sick could be 
healed ; he had power over death that men could be called from death 
back to mortal life. Many had witnessed this. He had power over 
the elements that the winds and the waves should obey his voice. 
He could speak, and loaves and fishes would materialize under his 
power. He had more power than had ever been revealed to man 
from the beginning of time on this earth, but there remained one 
thing more. He promised, just before he laid his body down, that he 
would be equal to the emergency and bring it up from the dead, not 
back to mortal life, but to a newness of life, to immortality and eternal 
life. And when he arose from the dead and came forth in splendor, 
a resurrected, immortal and eternal being, he then arose to the height 
of power, of glory and of majesty, and became the Master of all 
things, even death yielding to him, and he said he did only that 
which he had witnessed his Father do. Then, if it brought glory and 
honor and power and majesty to the Master to rise from the dead, 
so in like manner did it bring glory and honor and power and majesty 
to his Father to have in a similar manner arisen from the grave to 
possess a glorified body dwelling in the eternal world as the great 
organizer and presiding genius over all his creations, his sons and 
his daughters. 

A TESTIMONY THAT CHRIST AROSE FROM THE TOMB AND LIVES. 

Therefore, we rejoice in the witness we have that Jesus told the 
truth, that the testimony of his disciples concerning his resurrection 
is the truth, and we also know that the testimony of Joseph Smith 
and his brethren, who looked upon the face of the Redeemer, is true. 
I bear witness that I know what they have said is the truth. I know, 
as well as I know that I live, and look into your faces, that Jesus 
Christ lives, and he is the Redeemer of the world, that he arose from 
the dead with a tangible body, and still has that real body which 
Thomas touched when he thrust his hands into his side and felt the 
wound of the spear, and also the prints of the nails in his hands. I 
know by the witness and the revelations of God to me that Thomas 
told the truth. I know that Joseph Smith told the truth, for mine 
eyes have seen. For in the visions of the Lord to my soul, I have 
seen Christ's face, I have heard his voice. I know that he lives, that 
he is the Redeemer of the world, and that as he arose from the dead, 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 41 

a tangible and real individual, so shall all men arise in the resurrection 
from the dead. 

The Lord bless us to keep this faith in our hearts that we may go 
forth with charity for our brethren and sisters of the world, intrusted 
with these glorious truths for their blessings, that we may bring to 
them that which they sadly need, the fulness of the gospel of the 
Lord Jesus Christ, for their salvation. May they divest themselves 
of pride and of preconceived notions and prejudices, and not despise 
the source from whence this message comes, and not be as blind 
and ignorant as their fathers were before them, who thought no good 
could come from Nazareth. 

And if it should now happen, as it has happened, that from a de- 
spised source there has come the light of the Lord for the blessing 
of the world from a despised "Mormon," Oh, may our father's chil- 
dren divest themselves of blindness and see the glorious truth that 
has come that we now offer to the east and to the west, to the north 
and to the south, for their salvation in this life and in the world to 
come. 

The Lord bless us to do our part, and bless them that they may 
see that we are their friends, that we love them, and we would not 
harm them, that we hold precious and sacred things in trust for 
them and for ourselves, that we may honor and respect these glorious 
privileges that are ours, rise to the emergency with due gratitude, em- 
brace every commandment of our Father, and keep it that we may 
continue to be the light of the world and the salt of the earth, I pray, 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

Mrs. Franzeska Raabe Parkinson sang a soprano solo, "The 
Lord's Prayer." 

ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 

My heart is filled with a desire to say something to this wonder- 
ful audience, that will be prompted by the inspiration of our heavenly 
Father. I regret that, since I was presiding at the overflow meeting 
this morning, I did not hear what was said at the meeting in this 
building. I have been thrilled with the testimonies that have been 
borne this afternoon. The remarks of President Penrose were power- 
ful, although he is nearly ninety years of age. In him we have a 
living witness of the blessing of our heavenly Father for his servants. 

I was touched, too, with the thrilling faith and testimony of 
Brother Ballard. 

WHAT IS THE POWER BEHIND THE CHURCH? 

He made some references to an electric lighting system. What is 
it that makes the light? As he explained^ it is not the globe, nor the 
wires, nor the poles, nor the generators; but it is the water on the 
wheel that does the work.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



One hundred years ago, in the interest of humanity, the heavens 
were opened. God' the Father and Jesus Christ, his Son, came to the 
earth and revealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith this gospel of Jesus 
Christ. What is it that gives this Church its power? What is it that 
has brought all these people together on this occasion? Why have 
you come from afar to attend this conference? Because of the Spirit 
of our Father in heaven. It is this Spirit that is the water on the 
wheel. 

EXAMPLES OF THIS POWER. 

Some six months ago a rather delicate little woman came into 
my office. She is the wife of one of our missionaries. When her 
husband came to see me, as he was starting out to preach the gospel, 
I said to him : "Young man, what is it going to cost you to take this 
mission?" He replied: "I don't know, I have no idea. But," he 
continued, "my little wife and I have been saving for a long time. 
It has been her ambition and mine, as it has been the ambition of my 
widowed mother, that sometime I would go on a mission. Our sav- 
ings in the bank amount to $1,500, and we think probably that will be 
enough." 

"My girl," I said to the little wife, "how are you getting along? 
Have you spent all that money yet?" 
"No, not yet," she replied. 
"How much have you spent?" I asked. 

"Not any, yet," she replied, "my strawberries and peaches and 
garden stuff have been so profitable that instead of taking money 
out of the bank I have sent my husband all he needed and have added 
two hundred dollars to the account." That is water on the wheel. 

Not very long ago I called into my office a young man in whom 
I am greatly interested. He came with a smile and said : "You 
have a job for me, have you?" 

"Yes, I have a job for you?" 

"All right, what is it?" 

"I want you to go on a mission." 

"On a mission? I should say not, I can't go on a mission. I 
haven't been very active in Church work. My folks have been send- 
ing me to school. I have just been graduated." 

He was graduated with a bachelor of arts degree. 

"I have been studying all these years," he continued, "preparing 
myself to make a living. It is my duty now to go to work and help 
my folks." 

A few words to his excellent mother, a few words to his excel- 
lent father, a little encouragement to the boy himself, and away he 
went to preach the gospel — to induce his fellow men to strive to live 
in accordance with the perfect life and example of Jesus Christ. 

We are all familiar with the parable of Lazarus and the rich 
man. This missionary having gone into the field has been touched 
by the power and Spirit of God. The water has been working on 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 



4A 



the wheel, and, like Lazarus, he has become greatly interested in his 
friends who are left at home. He wants me to take up a labor with 
his associates to get them into the mission field. He urges especially 
that I talk to his brother. "I want him," he says, "to take a mission 
as soon as mine is completed." 

In my pocket I have a letter from him of fourteen pages. He 
writes that he has, during his college course, been studying phil- 
osophy, history, logic, ethics, etc., and he is amazed to find that all the 
wisdom of the wise men of the ages is contained in the gospel of 
Jesus Christ. He begins to see that there is water on our wheel. 

This young man has gone into the mission field. The Spirit has 
touched him and he writes giving me the names of his chums. If any 
of them are here this afternoon they will probably be keeping out of my 
way. He gives me a long list and asks me to work with them and send 
them into the mission field. When they are ready to come he says he 
will give them help, he will give them service, he will send them out- 
lines of the doctrines, he will give them the line of argument that means 
more than any kind of logic except that which is found in the gospel oi 
Jesus Christ. 

HOW MAY WE KNOW THE TRUTH ? 

My life has been devoted pretty largely to a study of mathematics 
The conclusions that I have reached in this work have been based 
upon some sort of definite and positive hypotheses and in coming to 
conclusions from these hypotheses, I have moved by logical steps to 
definite and certain conclusions. 

Now, how can we know that the gospel is true ? This afternoon 
you heard the testimony of Brother Ballard, you heard the testimony 
of President Penrose. If I were to ask all those present who know 
that the gospel is true to stand, nearly all of this great multitude would 
probably arise. In the Assembly Hall, this morning, three or four 
speakers each stood up and said he knew that Joseph Smith was a 
prophet, that Joseph Smith is a prophet, that this is the gospel of Jesus 
Christ. How can they know it? How can they speak thus positively? 

I will tell you how. Jesus himself has said : "This is not my 
doctrine but his that sent me," and "if any man" — not a few — but "if 
any man will do the will of my Father which is in heaven, he shall 
know of the doctrine, whether it be of God or whether I speak of 
myself." Therefore I say to you and to all the world, all a man needs 
to do is to live in accordance with the gospel teachings and he will 
know of the doctrine, whether it be of God or whether the man speaks 
of himself. 

MISSIONARIES LEARN THE TRUTH THROUGH SERVICE. 

Brethren and sisters, it is one hundred years ago this spring since 
the heavens were opened and the gospel was revealed. Those who 
have gone into the field to give service, without an exception, so far 



44 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



as I know, have gone not for money, not for honor, not for personal 
gain, but because they loved the Lord. In the mission field missionaries 
work for the good of others ; they do good to their fellowmen, they 
live in strict conformity with the Master's teachings and the promise 
in Holy Writ is fulfilled because into their heart comes that knowl- 
edge and each one says: "I know that Jesus is the Christ, that the 
gpspel has been revealed and that those who keep the commandments 
of our Father in heaven will be saved in his kingdom." 

Let us struggle on together, remembering that we all have weak- 
nesses ; let us live on, struggle on, and hope on, that our shortcom- 
ings may be overcome; that we may be thoroughly worthy of the 
wonderful blessings promised to the faithful, that the purposes of our 
Father may be fulfilled and that they may be fulfilled swiftly; I ask it, 
through Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 

(President of the Southern States Mission) 

It is because of a spirit of obedience to the request of the Presi- 
dent of the Church that I stand here at this time. I feel my weak- 
ness and utter inability without the aid of the Lord to supplement the 
splendid discourses that have been delivered at this conference thus 
far. ' 

It has been impressed upon my mind, by the instructions we have 
received, that our heavenly Father should be our eternal refuge and 
our guide through life. God said unto Moses: "I am the Lord thy 
God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house 
of bondage. Thou shalt have no other gods before me." One of old 
worshiped the god of ambition, and when earthly joys had grown dim, 
and earthly hopes been crushed, he said, out of the depths of a broken 
heart, "Had I but served my God with half the zeal I served my king, 
he would not in mine old age have left me naked unto my enemies." 
Another one, who was wealthy, when he was dying, said : "All that I 
have kept I have lost, and all that I have given away I have." What 
a splendid example of the lesson and value of sacrifice ! 

God is our refuge. To him Oliver Cowdery went when he was 
a school-teacher, boarding with the parents of Joseph Smith, the 
Prophet. After conversing about the plates, from which the Boole 
of Mormon was translated, Oliver appealed unto the Lord, and it was 
revealed unto him that of a verity, in truth Joseph did receive these 
plates from the angel Moroni. He went to help Joseph translate the 
sacred record, and in a revelation that God gave to the Prophet, he 
told Oliver that he had heard his prayers on that night; therefore 
Oliver knew that Joseph was a prophet, and that the work was true, 
because no one but himself and God knew that he had prayed for di- 
vine guidance in this matter. 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 



45 



The Spirit of the Lord is given to those who are worthy of it, 
and by that Spirit, as the Book of Mormon says, we may know the 
truth of all things. The Latter-day Saints have an anointing of the 
Holy One, the gift of the Holy Ghost, and this gift and guide makes 
it necessary that they be taught of men in things pertaining to God. 

As we have been told, this afternoon, by President Penrose, "Truth 
is knowledge of things as they are and as they were, and' as they 
are to come." This truth embraces every principle of the gospel. 
Joseph sought unto the Father and the glorious results are manifest. 
Elijah, in the power of his Priesthood, gave to the prophet the keys 
of salvation for the dead. 

"An angel from on high, 
The long, long silence broke, 
Descending from the sky, 
These gracious words he spoke; 
Lo, in Cumorah's lonely hill 
A sacred record lies concealed. 

"It speaks of Joseph's seed, 
And makes the remnant known, 
Of nations long since dead, 
Who once had dwelt alone. 
The fulness of the gospel, too, 
Its pages will reveal to view." 

So the sacred Nephite record came forth, another witness to 
the divinity of the Lord Jesus Christ. Moses came and restored the 
keys of the gathering unto the Prophet Joseph Smith, and behold the 
miraculous development of the gathering in all the earth, especially 
the gathering of the Jews, and the events that are making that great 
movement certain and near of accomplishment. 

Brethren and sisters, we have the knowledge, in this Church, 
that will enable every man and woman to secure salvation. We are 
told by the Apostle John : "Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try 
the spirits whether they are of God, because many false prophets are 
gone out into the world. Hereby know ye the Spirit of God : Every 
spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God: 
and every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the 
flesh is not of God : and this is that spirit of anti-Christ." 

With some sects a belief in the divinity of Christ is not required. 
Spiritualism, particularly, aims to destroy belief in the doctrine of 
the essentiality of the atoning blood of Jesus Christ. But the gospel 
teaches the divinity of Christ. It testifies that he is the Redeemer, 
the Son of God. 

The Apostle Paul says : "Blessed be the God and Father of our 
Lord, Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in 
heavenly places in Christ." And so I testify unto you, that in the 
gospel, in the Church, is every blessing and ordinace to be found 
which will bring forth eternal happiness and joy in the kingdom of 
God.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



How firm a foundation, ye Saints of the Lord, 
Is laid for your faith in his excellent word. 
What more can he say. than to you he hath said, 
You who unto Jesus for refuge have fled? 

I hear my testimony that Jesus lives; that he is the Christ, the 
Sou of God, the Redeemer of the world; that Joseph Smith is a 
prophel of Hod, and that the men who have stood at the head of 
this Church, and who now stand at the head of this, God's Church, 
as prophets, seers, and revelators, arc wise shepherds, faithful leaders, 
fathers to the people and to all mankind who will listen to their in- 
structions. 1 hear this testimony humbly, in the fear of God, and in 
the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem. "The Lord Victorious" (Mascagni), 
with great beauty and effect, calling forth much commendation for 
the leader and members of the chorus. 

Conference adjourned, until Monday morning at 10 o'clock. Ben- 
ediction was pronounced by Elder William L. Rich, President of the 
Bear Lake stake of Zion. 



FIRST OVERFLOW MEETING 

An overflow meeting of the conference was held in the As- 
sembly Hall at 10 a. m., Sunday morning, April 4, presided over by 
Elder Richard R. Lyman, of the Council of the Twelve. 

The singing was furnished by the Ogden Tabernacle Choir, Pro- 
fessor Joseph E. Ballantyne, conductor. 

The choir song, "Come Unto Me," solo, by Agnes Warner. 

Prayer was offered by Elder Antone Christensen. 

The choir sang, "O, Love Divine," solo by Mildred Ware. 

ELDER JAMES DUCKWORTH 

(President of the Blackfoot Stake of Zion) 

My brethren and sisters. I feel very keenly my responsibility 
in being invited to make a few remarks to this splendid body of 
Latter-day Saints ; and I realize that without the assistance of the 
Spirit of the Lord, it will be impossible for me to discharge acceptably 
to the Lord this great responsibility. I therefore crave an interest 
in your faith and prayers, to the end that there may be no impediment 
whatever in the enjoyment of that Spirit today, to which we are en- 
titled on all such occasions, and that always leads and guides into all 
truth. 

I have been profoundly impressed by the large attendance, not 
only in this building but in the larger tabernacle, in spite of the in- 
clemency of the weather, and I have been asking myself the ques- 



ELDER JAMES DUCKWORTH 



47 



tion, What does this mean, that so many people are gathered from far 
and near upon these grounds? I call to mind that which you no 
doubt have already thought of, that it is one hundred years ago, this 
spring, since the Prophet Joseph Smith received that wonderful mani- 
festation of the Father and the Son, at which time the great Latter- 
day work was ushered in. He was blessed more than any other 
man that we have knowledge of in seeing the Father and the Son, 
both personally before him, one of whom, the Son, told him in reply 
to his query, that none of the sects of the earth then extant were right ; 
and he became the instrument in the hands of the Lord in establish- 
ing the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. We are not 
all privileged to enjoy the same manifestation which he enjoyed, but 
through the establishment of that work, the Church of Jesus Christ, 
there has been placed within the reach of all of our Father's children, 
a knowledge of the divinity of the work that the Prophet Joseph 
Smith was instrumental in establishing upon the earth ; and I have 
been thinking seriously of that phase of the great Latter-day work. 

The question has been raised in outside quarters, what is it that 
holds the Latter-day Saints together? What is it that gives strength 
and stability to "Mormonism?" Because, contrary to the expectation 
of those who hope for the failure and the downfall of the latter-day 
work, with the growing years and the advancement of time, it seems 
to gather in strength and stability with promise of perpetuity for all 
time. 

I recall an incident in the life of the Savior, familiar to all of 
you, found in the 16th chapter of the Gospel according to St. Mat- 
thew, which reads: 

When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his 
disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I, the Son of man, am? And they 
said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist; some, Elias; and others, 
Jeremias, or one of the prophets. He saith unto them, But whom say 
ye that I am? And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, 
the Son of the living God. And Jesus answered and said unto him. Blessed 
art thou, Simon Barjona, for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto 
thee, but my Father which is in heaven. And I say unto thee, That thou 
art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my Church; and the gates of 
hell shall not prevail against it. 

As it was in those days, so it is in these days, flesh and blood 
cannot reveal unto men and women a knowledge of the divinity of the 
personality of the Lord Jesus .Christ, or of the existence of God our 
Eternal Father and a knowledge of his character and attributes. Men, 
by human learning and human seeking, cannot find out these things 
which pertain to divinity. There is a way provided, however, in the 
divine providence of the Father whereby men may come to a knowl- 
edge of the truth, and know these things for themselves, and that 
way is open to the Latter-day Saints and to all men and women. Flesh 
and blood cannot give to men and women a knowledge of the divine 
mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith ; man-wisdom alone cannot bring 
that knowledge to our Father's children. But there is a way provided 
whereby a knowledge of that great truth can be brought within the 



48 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



reach of every man and woman, and that way is pointed out in .the 
incident to which I have called attention : "Blessed art thou, Simon 
Barjona, for flesh and blood hath not revealed this unto thee, but 
my Father which is in heaven." He is my Father in heaven, and if 
we will do right today, he is just as willing- to bless us with the knowl- 
edge of his divinity as he was willing to bless the Apostle Peter with 
a knowledge of the divinity of the Savior. 

So, in answer to the query, wherein does the strength of "Mor- 
monism" lie? my answer would be this, that it lies in the individual 
testimony that is given to all Latter-day Saints who will honestly and 
prayerfully and righteously live for that same divine testimony. That 
testimony does not depend upon our learning, nor upon our education. 
That testimony does not depend upon family relationship nor worldly 
possessions. It depends upon conditions that every man and woman 
can comply with. If we will exercise faith in God the eternal Father, 
if we will repent in all sincerity of our shortcomings and our trans- 
gressions, if we will go down into the waters and receive baptism 
by immersion, by one having authority, for the remission of our sins; 
if we then shall receive the imposition of hands for the reception 
of the Holy Ghost, and live in such a way that his influence shall be 
with us and abide with us, we shall know for ourselves whether or not 
this work is of God the eternal Father, and whether the Savior has 
spoken in divine right, and is indeed the Savior of the world ; and no 
power of man can take this knowledge from the Latter-day Saints. 
We may know these things for ourselves, and we are not dependent 
upon any other man or any other men in all the world for a knowl- 
edge of these things ; and if there is one thing that we should prize 
above another, it is that testimony which our heavenly Father has 
promised unto us. We need it; we are not safe without it, in this 
day of contending creeds and conflicting opinions, with reference to 
matters religious. It is of the utmost importance that our feet should 
be planted upon a foundation that cannot be moved, that is safe and 
solid beyond all question; and that is the foundation of this great 
Latter-day work, that is the foundation upon which your faith and 
mine is placed, and until it rests upon that foundation it is 
not secure. It is given unto every man and every woman and to every 
boy and girl, for the Lord is no respecter of persons, and "in every 
nation he that feareth him and worketh righteousness, is accepted with 
him." Thus, when our elders go into .the nations of the earth, they 
make the promise to all nations, that that testimony is within the 
reach of our Father's children; and in our testimony meetings, as 
they are held throughout the length and breadth of Zion, the Saints 
from England, from Scotland, from Belgium, from any and every 
other part of the world in which the gospel has been preached, bear 
record of the same truth, that in the land from which they came the 
Holy Ghost is enjoyed by those who have accepted the truth. They 
all bear the same testimony of the goodness of God to them' in o-rving 
to them a knowledge of the divine mission of the Prophet Joseph 
Smith and the divinity of the great Latter-day work that he was in- 



ELDER JAMES DUCKWORTH 



49 



strumental in initiating upon the earth. And so long- as we enjoy 
that testimony we shall never be led astray; for this is God's work, 
it is not the work of man. It is the work of the Almighty, and he 
will take care of it, and it will never fall, no matter what its enemies 
may hope and pray to the contrary. 

Upon another occasion, the Savior was confronted with a de- 
fection in the ranks of those who had been his professed believers, 
and turning to the Twelve, he said to them, "And will ye also go 
away?" And Peter, that same apostle that was so impetuous on all 
occasions, said, "Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words 
'of eternal life." So it is today. Outside of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints, where shall we go? For in this work 
is found the words of eternal life, for it is indeed the work of God, 
and it has to deal with everything that is essential to the growth and 
the happiness of our Father's children, in temporalities as well as 
spiritualities, for the Lord is interested in all that concerns your hap- 
piness and mine. He is our Father in very deed, and in the estab- 
lishment of his work upon the earth in these days he has in mind 
not only the spiritual welfare of his children, but also their temporal 
welfare ; and through his servants from time to time he gives unto 
us his mind and will. 

And here I want to bear testimony to the character of his ser- 
vants as they have been placed in the Church in the past, and as they 
exist in the Church today. I know that these men are men of God. 
I know that they give to the Latter-day Saints the revelations of 
the Lord, the mind and will of God, the Father, and that in so 
far as we will abide by the counsels which they are inspired to give 
unto us from time to time we shall be continually in the path of 
eternal life; that we shall enjoy real happiness in this life and pre- 
pare ourselves for that which is greater in the life to come. I do 
not know of the divinity of the Latter-day work by what any man 
has said to me ; but I know as I live that Joseph Smith was and is a 
prophet of the living God, and that his successors in the presidency 
have been and are prophets of the living God, for the inspiration of the 
Almighty has given into my soul that knowledge, to my complete 
and absolute satisfaction. I pray the Lord that he will bless the Lat- 
ter-day Saints, that he will help us to be true to the opportunities 
we enjoy, that his Spirit will ever be with us through- our lives, and 
that in the end we will all receive that welcome plaudit, "Well done, 
thou good and faithful servant, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord," 
I ask in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The Ogden tabernacle choir sang : "Lead, Kindly Light." 

ELDER OSCAR A. KIRKHAM 

(Executive Director of the Y. M .M. I. A.) 

It is certainly an inspiration to look out upon this great sea of 
faces. I sincerely trust that God will bless me with his Holy Spirit

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



for the few minutes that I address you, and that you in turn may 
know what I am talking about. 

The great teacher, Karl G. Maeser, said : "It is not what is 
said so much that counts, but how it is received." It is how you re- 
ceive what shall be spoken here this morning, and what has been 
spoken, not so much the words, but how they are received, and how 
they pour virtue into our lives, that counts. 

I want to make an appeal for the people that are dearest and nearest 
to your hearts, the boys and girls of this Church. This wonderful 
story has come from the great world war: When the Hun came 
knocking at the gates of Belgium, and tore into that wonderfully for- 
tified city of Liege, the word went rapidly out to France, that every 
Frenchmen must take his gun and hurry to defend his fatherland. 
There was no time to go to training camps ; there was no time to go 
to splendid places like our boys have had an opportunity to go to, and 
study for a time and prepare themselves. But every Frenchman must 
take his gun at once and hurry to the front. Away down in Southern 
France, a father met this call, said good-bye to his wife, Marie, and 
his only boy, a lad of 16 years, Noal ; The Hun came tearing on 
through Northern France, until finally he had driven the armies to 
the river Marne. Then there arose that great leader Joffre, who 
spoke these wonderfully inspiring words, "They shall not pass !" And 
every Frenchman's heart was thrilled, and each was determined that 
he would give his last drop of blood, if need be, to hold that land. 
In the midst of this terrible conflict, this father, with many other 
fathers, fell. The line was held, the great battle was over, and when 
this father came from the hospital his ami was gone, and through 
his body bullets had torn a terrible hole. He went back to his humble 
home in Southern France. At the gate he met his wife, Marie, in 
tears, and yet they resolved that they would fight anew. 

And then the father said, "Yes, but where is Noal, where is 
Noal!" 

And the mother replied : "O, when you went away he became a 
law unto himself. He would not listen to me. He went off into the 
city ; he spent the money, and there he is now, in the hospital, the 
result of his sin and riotous living." 

Then that French father said these wonderful words: "My God, 
what have I been fighting for?" 

What did 50,000 American men give their lives for, and millions 
in Flander's field, and thousands of them, of our splendid American 
youth? For something that we call liberty? For something that 
we call the privilege of men to go and come, a statute on a book, a 
written page, the understanding of nations? It was for the youth. 
It was for them we bled, for whom the world indeed bled and suf- 
fered; your boys and your girls. Who shall reap that harvest of 
peace and progress which God has in store for this world, in years 
that are before us, in the preparation for his personal coming to reign 
as King of kings and Lord of lords? That day is coming, and there 
is a marvelous day preceding it, the day of preparation. There is not 



ELDER OSCAR A. KIRKHAM 



51 



a man or a woman in this audience today but who would give help 
in this important preparation, and the help is just so simple: it is just 
taking care of the boy that you are going to meet when you go back 
home, and the girl that you are going to meet there. And if every 
father might get it deep into his heart, the absolute necessity of know- 
ing where they are and what they are doing, he'll make a real contri- 
bution, not only to the honor of his name but to the citizenship of this 
splendid Church and Nation of ours. 

Now, I am very much interested in some definite programs that 
have been prepared for the boy scout work, that this uniform repre- 
sents, for I happen to be the representative of some couple of thousands 
of boys in Salt Lake City as well as in other parts. An excellent pro- 
gram ! Have you got it in your wards? Do your boys follow that 
program ? A person told me the other evening that the program of 
seeking out boy scouts increased the efficiency of priesthood quorums 
in his ward ; it had meant an increased attendance from 4 to 48 ; that it 
had increased attendance at Sunday schools ; that it made a real contri- 
bution not only to the boys themselves but to the great work of the 
Church and its auxiliaries. It may be said by some bishops: "We do not 
want any scouting among our boys ; our boys are well enough." Well, 
these bishops do not understand. We called at a meeting where the boys 
of- such a bishop were, and, they were tearing up the benches. He, in 
his despair cried, "Sit down !" This good old bishop, after what he 
said about not wanting this program, finally planted a number of 
those boys down on a bench. I took a rope out of my pocket, and tied 
a knot, and I said, "Can you tie that knot?" And one rough fellow 
said, "Ah, nuts! What are you going to do?" and never took any 
interest in it! I took no notice of it, but tied another knot, a more 
complicated one. And then another fellow said, "Can you tie that 
again?" I said, "Sure." And I got another piece of rope. It wasn't 
two minutes until every boy was so quiet you could hear the old clock 
tick upon the wall, and the bishop was just as anxious as he could be 
to get hold of a piece of rope himself! 

Yes, we cannot just say, "Be good," to Johnny and Mary: we 
must think out many things for them to do. The busy boy is an in- 
terested boy, he is a safe boy. We have had 800 of them up at the 
University of Utah this week. -My, you should have seen them, as 
they went to the swim, and how they were taught to save life. They 
enjoyed these things as many, many boys do now in this Church. One 
boy in Arizona dug his father from under a load of hay, and taught 
him a better method of respiration, and when a doctor came, and saw 
what the boy had done; he said, "You have saved the life of that 
man, your father, my boy." Their hearts were all bent on doing 
that type of thing. 

You say, the youth of the land are becoming wayward ; the girls 
go out in automobiles in the summer time, and many of them fall, and 
the boys are a law unto themselves. Let me say this, in all the sin- 
cerity of my soul, that it is not "Lost, a Boy," but "Lost, a Leader." 
The responsibility is ours ; it belongs to us ; and when God opens the 



52 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



book of life we will be astonished and surprised to know that our hearts 
were bent on things that we thought were bigger, and we left undone 
and uncared for the greatest responsibility that God gave us, the 
keeping of our children. 

May God help us to remember when we look into their faces that 
they are ours, that God gives them to us not only to clothe and to 
school and to discipline as we meet them at the table, perhaps, but they 
are ours to walk with, ours to play with ; they are ours to pray with, 
is my humble prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER S. NORMAN LEE 

(President of the Box Elder Stake of Zion.) 

I think it very fitting, at this time, to refer to the resurrection of 
the Savior ; in fact, to the atonement ; and I wish to express myself 
concerning the fitness of these very modest decorations upon the stand. 
I had forgotten all about this being Easter — it was snowing outside- - 
and I saw these flowers ; that reminded me of the great work done in 
the meridian of time for the human family, the light of which has 
reflected even unto our day. I have no notion of saying very much 
about the atonement at the present time, except to use it as an intro- 
duction to the restoration of the gospel through the medium and in- 
strumentality of the Prophet Joseph Smith. 

I remember very well the story of the interest the Prophet took 
in the propaganda of various religious denominations in the vicinity of 
his home town, when he was a boy about 14 years of age, and the 
concern that he felt about allying himself with one sect or another. 
And I recall very particularly the words of the Savior to him at the 
time of the vision in the sacred grove, that he was to join none of the 
sects in the world at that time, because they observed only a form 
of godliness ; that they drew near unto him with their lips but their 
hearts were far from him. 

I have heard one of the authorities of the Church in this day 
remark that we do not say prayers. Now, I think perhaps that he was 
anxious to impress upon us the futility of words ; that if we observe 
to speak our prayers only, we are as the people in that day, who drew 
near unto the Lord with their lips, but their hearts were far from him. 
What this brother desired to impress upon us is that prayers come 
from the heart, and are acted out. This lesson has remained with me, 
but I do not think that it excludes the utterance of the fulness of the 
heart because there is a danger of forgetting the Lord, except with 
our mouths. I think that the utterance of the prayers that are in our 
hearts should not be excluded for that reason. I regard prayer as 
one of the most important observances of the people of the Lord, and 
I cannot understand, after twenty-five years as a servant of the 
Lord in active service, how Latter-day Saints can be content to go 
about their daily duties without the expression of the fulness of their 
hearts in prayer. I cannot understand how people expect to make 



ELDER S. NORMAN LEE 



53 



any progress in this Church without prayer, which is the key to the 
Father's heart. 

In Box Elder we are detached from the busy world, which the 
people in the center stakes of Zion - are subjected to, and I think we 
live a simpler life. I believe we live a more simple life than that 
which I discover in my visits to the larger cities of Salt Lake and 
Ogden. We are more simple as a rule in our dress — with some few 
exceptions. Of course, we have imitators among us, just the same 
as we have imitators everywhere ; and some of them make monkeys 
of themselves in trying to imitate, because that is the particular function 
of a monkey or an ape. So those who do that do not imitate, exactly. 
Our stake numbers about seven thousand. We are mostly farmers 
and fruit growers. We talk simply to one another and directly. When 
I have occasion to say to a bishop in the stake that he is not doing quite 
what he is required to do, I say to. him: "Bishop, you are not toeing 
the mark, you are not up to the scratch," instead of saying, "Bishop, 
we have a great work to perform in the Church. We require all of 
the force available. We must all work together, and do the very 
best we can. Now, you are doing splendidly in this ward. You are 
a very fine bishop. The people love you, and the authorities of the 
Church love you ; but now, bishop, in this department here, there is 
something that is not quite right. I do not suppose you are to blame 
for it, it probably has escaped your notice," etc. We do not do that 
sort of thing up there. Although I am a very young man comparatively, 
I say, "Bishop, buck up, and see that that thing is attended to." And 
we said to one a short time ago, "Now, bishop, we expect you to bear 
the responsibility of the progress of your ward, and we do not expect 
you to come to us and complain about any officer you have in your 
ward. That is your business, do not bother us with it. But we hold 
you directly accountable." Well, at first some of our bishops said, "Do 
not come and interfere with any of our meetings, if you are going 
to hold us responsible. Do not bring speakers of the general author- 
ities, especially on a night when our officers are supposed to be at- 
tending to that we are responsible for, and thereby interrupt things 
for which we are responsible in our ward." 

Now, I am just endeavoring to get at a point I wish to make in 
reference to prayer. I probably have gone a long way around to it ; 
whereas, my habit is to go directly to the point. But I believe in the 
simplicity of the utterance of the prayer that is in our hearts. I do 
no think we need deal -with the Lord in forms of generality. I think 
the Lord understands what is in our hearts. In fact, the scriptures 
say so. He understands what we need before we ask it, but he requires 
that we ask for the things that we need, and therein lies a line of 
development. We learn to know thereby the things that are good 
for us, and that are not good for us. We learn to draw near unto the 
Lord, and also learn what would estrange us from the Lord and erect 
a barrier between us and him. 

And so in our teachings in the Box Elder stake, we have directed 
our people to be quite simple in their expressions and utterances of 



54 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



what is in their hearts ; and, to set an example to the stake, the presi- 
dency do that. And when something com.es up regarding the conduct 
of some one in the Church — say a high councilor, or bishop, — be- 
cause that makes the matter more effective, they being more promi- 
nent than others — when one of them becomes hard to control, or in- 
sists upon doing something he should not do, we go before the Lord 
and say: "Father, help us that we may be able to reach that man, 
and set him right. He is wrong, we know that. But in our wisdom 
and intelligence and ability, we are unable to set him right. We have 
tried it, and we have not been able to succeed. Now, Father, we would 
like to have you help us in this matter. It is not a matter of selfish- 
ness ; it is a matter of the welfare of the Church. We do not desire 
to be set up before the people as great men. We want to be known 
among thy people here in this stake where we live as the most ser- 
viceable and democratic of all. Now, Father, if you will help us 
do this, we shall do all that we can do." 

And then, instead of waiting for a miraculous manifestation in 
answer to that prayer, we use all the judgment that the Lord has 
blessed us with, and we go about our work, and the testimony that T 
want to bear is that it has. resulted in good. We do not wait until 
we are urged, but we go ahead and use our intelligence and the wis- 
dom God has blessed us with, but we do not wish to use that intelli- 
gence independently of the Lord. That is the point I wish to make. 

Now, the Prophet Joseph was simple. The Savior used simplicity 
in prayer. One of the things that I think has discouraged young peo- 
ple in reference to prayer is that in our wards we find almost half of 
our people who do not observe family prayer. A few years ago it was 
thought an achievement to be eloquent in prayer, to repeat high plati- 
tudes, something that had been memorable in the Church, and it took 
a long while to use these things, and the young people grew tired. I re- 
member in a family I belonged to that I dreaded to have a certain 
one called upon to be "mouth" at prayers in the morning, because I 
was very sure to be tired, and by the time it was over I would per- 
haps be found sitting upon the floor instead of kneeling. One thing 
T admire is simplicity in prayer. Indeed, I think it is very necessary. 
I do not understand how parents can expect to have the influence over 
their children that they should have if they do not- engage in family 
prayers. Now, I am not authorized to speak authoritatively upon this 
point, because we are advised not to shout until we are safely out of 
danger. My family is just growing up, but they have grown up far 
enough so that I know, that without family prayers I should have 
lost much of the grip upon them that I have. I know there is a way 
to prevent young people from breaking away, and even if they should 
get loose, there is a way whereby one may regain control of his chil- 
dren, through the medium of prayer. I have seen many incipient 
quarrels nipped in the bud, or quarrels stopped after they had begun, 
by the family prayer in the morning or in the evening ; and ill feel- 
ings in the family have been stopped, and not been started again, be- 
cause who can fall down and direct a prayer to the Lord with hard 



ELDER S. NORMAN LEE

feelings in his heart? His heart may feel s'ore and hard when he 
kneels down, but those feelings are sure to be banished, and he is 
sure to displace those feelings by the feeling that he is in communion 
with his Father in heaven. 

I wish I could preach this sermon on prayer to the Saints 
everywhere, that men might be induced to turn from their careless- 
ness and enter seriously into this form of devotion which has been 
established in the Church. I have written of it for many years past, 
in an ordinary newspaper. I have written of it in Church periodicals 
where I have had an opportunity, because it is close to my heart. I 
believe with all my soul in the effectiveness of sincere, simple 
prayer, and I believe after three years of experience in the Box Elder 
stake, that we can go into any part of the stake and receive evidence 
there, beyond question, of the loyalty arid faithfulness of the Saints. 
That is a testimony to me that our prayers have been answered, be- 
cause we never attempt to pray before the Saints without having 
prepared ourselves -through the medium of prayer. And we do not 
think prayer alone is sufficient. 

The Lord has said, Take no thought what ye shall say, for it shall 
be given unto you in the very hour what we shall say; but lay up 
continually the words of life that you may have something to draw 
upon. 

I wish to say, in conclusion, that there is .not anything that I de- 
sire for myself that I do not desire for every member of this Church, 
and for that matter, for every member of the human family. I have 
spent some years in carrying the message of truth to those who 
sit in darkness. I have seen some of the fruits of my labors, and 
there would be nothing dearer to me than to spend all my days in 
preaching the truth to those who are ready to receive it. May that 
spirit take hold of this people, because, in my opinion, there is going to 
be such a call for missionaries as the Church has never experienced 
before, and we are going to be sent into every part of the world. A 
great many of us are going to know the truth of the work from actual 
experience, and a great many are going to suffer one way and an- 
other for the testimony of the truth ; and I am preaching to the people 
to make reservations for a few years to be devoted to the work of the 
ministry among those who are in darkness ; and may God bless this 
people and all who are active in the work of the Lord, is my prayer, 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir, with Myrtle Higley and Mildred Ware, sang, "Now 
Jesus Loved Martha and her Sister and Lazarus." 

ELDER WILLIAM T. JACK 

(President of the Cassia Stake of Zion) 

This conference marks the 90th year since the organization of 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and I feel very happy 
to be present and partake of the spirit that is always present with 



56 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the Latter-day Saints when they assemble together for the purpose 
of being - instructed in the work of the Lord. 

I have listened with very much interest to the remarks of the 
previous speakers, and see in them very much food for reflection, and 
they should be a means of valuable suggestion to all present that have 
listened to them. 

This passage of scripture came to my mind while Elder Kirkham 
was addressing us upon the importance of our boys and our girls, 
"What doth it profit a man, though he shall gain the whole world, 
and lose his own soul, and what shall a man give in exchange for his 
soul?" This sentence was uttered by the Redeemer, after he had 
ima'dse a survey qf the conditions then existing in the world, and I 
think, looking down the stream of time to the age in which we live, 
and viewing ambitions and aspirations, aims, and means and ways 
adopted by the children of men for the accumulation of wealth, real- 
izing that where their treasure is shall their hearts be also, this sent- 
ence comes to us not only as an interrogation, but it comes as a very 
strong warning. It comes to us bearing with it its own answer. There 
is no person who can read that sentence, and not receive the answer 
in the same spirit in which the question is written ; and the thought 
that came to my mind in this connection was with reference to us as 
parents in Israel — what shall it profit us, though we gain honor, re- 
nown, popularity, and place, and means to gratify our vain ambitions, 
and lose our sons and our daughters? And what shall we give in 
exchange for their souls ? 

The Lord has told us in one of the revelations to the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, that the responsibility of the early training of the boys 
and girls rests upon the heads of the parents; and that if we fail in 
that responsibility, and our children should go astray later on in life, 
the condemnation will be ours. I think that is an inevitable, definite 
law. I remember the remarks made by our Father in heaven to Enoch, 
when he told him of his work and of his desires, they were summed 
up in a very few words, the work that the Lord had gone to in the' 
firmament and in beautifying the earth, in making the trees to grow 
and providing grain for food and means for the manufacture of wear- 
ing apparel of the people, and all that we wish and have around about 
us.. The Lord in forming all these, and in creating man, placing him 
on the earth, and giving him laws, commandments and precepts, made 
a history of the past that is a great criterion for man to follow. It re- 
solved itself into these words: "This is my work and my glory, to 
bring to pass the immortality and the eternal life of man." Now, I take 
it from that sentence that all this that the Lord is doing and all that 
he has so far accomplished in the earth, in the great fall, in the bring- 
ing to pass of the immortality and the eternal life of man, that the 
plan would be a failure, be fruitless indeed, and esteemed for naught, 
if parents do not do their duty. I see parents who, when their chil- 
dren become a little reckless, get hold of the false spirit that every- 
thing is natural. I think it has come to us in an old tale, from 
away back in the mystic history of the early days of Greece. When 



ELDER WILLIAM T. JACK 



57 



Hercules was a boy, just reaching the period of life when there was 
a question in his mind which path he should pursue, he went forth 
by himself, and sat down and meditated. There came to him the 
temptation pictured to us in the form of a beautiful young woman. 
She came to him and said, "Hercules, I know what you want ; the path 
that I will point out to you will bring pleasure, will bring you con- 
stant place in society, will bring the choice things of life, to eat and 
to drink and clothing to wear, and you shall be popular in the society 
in which you shall move, arid your whole life will be one constant 
round of pleasure." But he said to her, "What is your name?" And in 
reply, she said, "My enemies call me vice, but my friends call me 
pleasure." Then there appeared to him another beautiful woman, and 
she said to Hercules, "I shall not deceive you ; the path that I shall 
point out to you will be a path of labor, a path of toil, a path of self- 
sacrifice, a path in which you will have to devote a great deal of your 
effort and energy; you will have to forget yourself; you will have to 
serve your friends ; you will have to serve the people of Greece ; but 
if you will take this path and pursue it, although it may bring to you 
much sweat and toil and much privation and many self-sacrifices, you 
shall become immortal." Then he said, "What is your name?" She 
replied, "My name is duty." 

Now, I think this same spirit comes into the lives of many of 
our boys and girls during the age of adolescence ; so I say, when par- 
ents see a disposition among the young people to go their own way, 
to do as they please, as they express it, parents should not give them 
the lines, so to speak, relinquish to them all of their parental care, 
and permit the boys, like a wild team, to run away. I wonder how 
many of our fathers, when they have a team which tries to run away, 
let loose the lines and let them go. Not many. I think our common 
sense would suggest the importance of taking a similar course to pre- 
vent the running astray of some of our boys. I have always believed 
that if our parents are honest in their religion ; if they have their con- 
science in the work that they are doing, and if they will go before the 
Lord, as has been stated here by President Lee, in constant supplica- 
tion ; though their sons and daughters may go wild and recreant 
for a time, the Lord will always bring themi back, and will save 
them. If we have taken our part in teaching them the principles of 
the gospel and in training them in the ways they should go, I believe 
that the Lord will take hold and help us by his divine power, and 
will bring them back ; and our glory will be materially increased in 
the future. If we are successful in this life, it seems to me, in the rear- 
ing of an honorable family of boys and girls, men and women who 
are instruments in the hands of the Lord in helping to bring about 
his work, and helping to bring about his purposes in the earth, that 
will be accounted successful. Our success will not be counted by our 
public show or our popularity among men, but there is more in the fact 
of the proper rearing of families, the exercising of a righteous and 
wholesome influence all our lives upon those who are round about us, 
that our lives may radiate the spirit and the impression that will 



58 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



make the young people better men and women in the future than they 
have been in the past, and will be a credit to us in the future. 

I rejoice in the testimony of the truth and in the opportunity that 
has been given to the Latter-day Saints to live acceptable lives before 
the Lord. If we are successful in this, and especially during these 
times through which we are passing, I believe that the few words ex- 
pressed through the Prophet Daniel, by the Lord, after the Lord had 
shown him the great vision of war and turmoil that were coming into 
the world and through which we are passing at the present time, will 
apply. He makes this simple statement, conveying a volume of thought 
to ever - Latter-day Saint, that those who are faithful during 
these times among the Latter-day Saints shall shine with the bright- 
ness of the firmament, while those who turn many to righteousness 
shall shine as the stars for ever and ever. 

May we devote our lives to this work that these blessings may 
come to us, is my prayer, and I ask it in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem, "Earth and Heaven." 
Benediction was pronounced by Elder Charles B. Stewart.

ELDER SERGE BALLIF 

(President of the Cache Stake of Zion) 

My beloved brethren and sisters, in standing before this congre- 
gation, I feel very humble and weak, and I sincerely desire that I 
may have your sympathy, and that I may have the Spirit of the Lord 
to direct me in the few remarks that I make this afternoon. 

My heart is full of thanksgiving to our heavenly Father for the 
membership which I have in this Church. I prize it above all other 
things. I am thankful for the Priesthood which I have received, for 
the blessings and the unspeakable joy that it has brought to my soul. 

It was indeed a great manifestation and blessing to me this morn- 
ing to hear our President sound the key-note of our conference. I

felt that he was inspired of the Lord in his remarks, and the testi- 
mony came to my soul that he is indeed a prophet of the Lord, that 
the mantle of the Prophet Joseph F. Smith has fallen upon him. That 
is burning in my bosom. This is my testimony, my brethren and 
sisters, I know that he is a prophet of God. 

It is a great joy to the world when we announce that it is one 
hundred years since the appearance of the Father and the Son to the 
Prophet Joseph Smith. There has never been a time in my life since 
my father told me of the occurrence that I have had any doubt in my 
soul that the Prophet saw the Father and the Son, and that he heard 
the Father say to him "Joseph, this is my beloved Son ; hear him." And 
indeed he had a message to deliver to that youthful person who so 
soon became the Prophet of the .Lord. 

In my experience in traveling in different parts of the world, I 
have often thought of the words, "They are all wrong, they worship 
me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me ; they teach for 
doctrine the commandments of men." I have many times testified 
before congregations of the world to this wonderful statement ; and 
I have often thought, I wonder what the people think, what these great 
so-called Christian nations think, when we stand before them and 
make that statement. My brethren and sisters, it has been my priv- 
ilege to bear my testimony of the divine mission of the Prophet Jo- 
seph Smith in England, in Belgium, in France, in Switzerland, in all 
the provinces of Germany, and in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, and 
my heart has been aglow with joy and satisfaction unspeakable when 
I have had the privilege of bearing this testimony to the people. 

I remember when on my first mission, in 1890, I was called to 
Switzerland, and was going from house to house without money and 
without price, and bearing my testimony to the people, I was once 
about to go into a large house, the owner of which must have been 
a very wealthy man, and he met me at the door. He did not invite 
me in, but in my humble way I bore my testimony to him of the di- 
vine mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith and of the gospel being 
restored in its fulness; and I preached to him the principles of* faith, 
repentance and baptism, and I will never forget the reply that he 
made to me. "My dear boy," he said, "I admire you for your courage, 
but your doctrine I cannot accept." 

Not very long ago I read a letter from one of my old friends in 
the city of Vienna, capital of Austria. This man was in one of the 
high schools of Vienna when I was there on my mission, I remember ; 
and he related to me in that letter the condition that exists in that 
land at the present time. He said, "Brother Baliff, it is not as it was 
when you were here. When we go along the main thoroughfares 
and the places, or gardens, in Vienna, we see mothers with infants 
in their arms starving, they are so much in want of bread to keep life 
in the souls of their little ones, and hundreds and thousands of people, 
women and children, are dying for the want of food and clothing to 
keep them warm." I thought to myself, I wonder how many of those 
people who are in that condition today heard the elders bear their 



60 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



testimony to them in days gone by. I believe that those people who 
did hear those testimonies, and who are now suffering those terrible 
privations and hardships, are touched in their feelings, and that their 
hearts are filled with remorse because they turned away from that hum- 
ble message of life and salvation. 

I often feel, too, many times in looking over the congregations 
of the Saints, and I ask myself the question: Do we appreciate the 
blessings that we enjoy in this land of plenty? O how kind and 
merciful the Lord has been to us. We have plenty; we have to spare. 
And sometimes I wonder, in our times of plenty, if we remember 
the Lord as we should do. 

In our stake, the Cache stake of Zion, last year we paid the 
largest tithing that has been known in the history of the stake. But, 
in looking over the records, examining our conditions, examining 
myself and my friends, I ask myself the question, Are we paying a 
tithing? And I want to say, my brethren and sisters, I do not want 
to judge Israel, but I believe that many of us have forgotten the 
Lord and the great blessings that he has poured out upon us, and 
do not remember how he has blessed this land, how he has made this 
land indeed prosperous, has blessed the soil so that it produces in its 
richness. We came into this barren land, and it is now teeming with 
wealth. The Lord has blessed us in all our outgoings and incom- 
ings. But I ask today, how many of our sons and daughters remem- 
ber the Lord? How many of them, night and morning, call their 
little families about the family altar and offer up thanksgiving and 
praise to God the eternal Father for the blessings of health and 
strength and for the things that have come into their homes. I am 
afraid, my brethren and sisters, that we are not grateful enough for 
all of these things. I believe that we ought to be more prayerful and 
more humble, that our children, the greatest gifts and blessings that 
we could have come into our homes, have been given to us. But 
what a responsibility there is in every home, to care for and train 
and properly rear those children that God has blessed us with. What 
a great responsibility in training those young men and women that 
when they grow to the age of understanding they may indeed be 
representatives of the pioneer families. 

I was thinking last evening, in reading the account of the Relief 
Society conference, that in that vast gathering there were only four 
who had seen the Prophet Joseph Smith. Today the witnesses who 
have seen and known the Prophet Joseph are getting rare, and the 
time will soon come when we will not have these living testimonies 
from men and women who can stand up and bear testimony that 
they have seen and heard the Prophet Joseph. Do we appreciate the 
testimonies of these living witnesses of the divine mission of the 
Prophet Joseph Smith? I hope and trust that it will grow into our 
souls, and be burned into the souls of the children of the Latter-day 
Saints, the testimony of the divine mission of the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, and also the testimony of those who have come after them. 

I want to bear testimony that I knew the Prophet Brigham 



ELDER SERGE BALLIF 



61 



Young. I heard his voice, I heard his testimony; and the Spirit of 
the Lord testified to me that he was indeed a prophet of the Lord, 
and so it is with all of his successors, and I am thankful in my 
heart to God, my heavenly Father, that he raised up these mighty 
men. And when I look upon this great congregation that gather to- 
gether in our conferences, I think of the many millions of people who 
have heard the testimony of the gospel, and many hundreds of thou- 
sands have embraced the gospel, and a wonderful work has been 
wrought in this one hundred years. There is nothing recorded in 
history to compare with the .marvelous work and a wonder that has 
been accomplished since the Father and his Son appeared unto the 
Prophet Joseph Smith. 

I am very grateful for the privilege of being with you today and 
partaking of the spirit of this conference; and I pray that the Lord 
may help us all, that we may live better lives, and appreciate more 
highly the great blessings that come through obedience to the gospel 
of the Lord Jesus Christ. 

May the Lord help us to be humble and true to our covenants, 
is my prayer, which I ask in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

Quartet and choir sang, "Blessed Be the Lord God of Israel." 

ELDER URIAH G. MILLER 

(President of the Cottonwood Stake of Zion) 

My brethren and sisters, I am not accustomed to. standing before 
a congregation of this magnitude, and I am confident, if you 
knew just exactly how I feel at this particular time, that in your 
hearts would be a prayer that the weight of the load might be lifted, 
and that for the short time that I stand before you I may be blessed 
with the spirit of this office and calling. I recognize the fact that peo- 
ple are gathered together from all parts of the Church for the pur- 
pose of attending the general conference of the Church, and that they 
are desirous of hearing from the authorities of the Church ; and in- 
asmuch as I have been asked along with some other brethren to oc- 
cupy a portion of the time on this occasion, I hope and trust that the 
Lord will be merciful and will bless me with the spirit of liberty. 

I believe that we have all enjoyed the meetings thus far. We have 
been particularly taken up with the most splendid singing that we 
have heard. Many of us, possibly, have never before had the privilege 
of hearing the Ogden choir. We have heard of it ; and we have heard 
many very fine things from this most splendid musical organization 
today. 

I want to read to you a passage of scripture, and if I say nothing 
more than to read this passage of scripture I trust that it will be 
to our value. Recorded in the 8th chapter of the Acts of the Apostles 
is some history of the ancient Church, that deals with the persecutions 
that came upon the Saints. It was about or soon after the time when 



62 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 

J 

Stephen was stoned to death. Evidently, from the reading of the 
Bible, a great deal of persecution was organized against the Church 
at that particular time. The people were scattered from one part 
of the country to the other, out from Jerusalem. The brethren, in 
whatever direction they went, were preaching Christ and him cruci- 
fied unto the people with whom they came in contact. And Philip, 
one of the authorized servants of the Lord, went into Samaria, and 
preached the gospel unto the people of Samaria. Many of them be- 
lieved on his words, and the apostles evidently were at Jerusalem or 
thereabout, and through some means or other they learned of this, 
and here we read: "Now when the apostles which were at Jerusa- 
lem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent 
unto them Peter and John, who, when they were come down, prayed 
for them that they might receive the Holy Ghost, for as yet he was 
fallen upon none of them, only they were baptized in the name of the 
Lord Jesus. Then laid they their hands upon them, and they re- 
ceived the Holy Ghost." It is the latter part of these verses that I 
desire to draw attention to at this time, that part which deals with 
the conferring of the Holy Ghost. There are many beautiful things 
in these few passages of scripture. The question of authority, with 
other things, is recorded, but you know I have in mind more than 
any other one item the question of the reception of the Holy Ghost. 
As a religious organization, we believe in God, the Father, and in his 
Son Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost. We believe that there is 
only one authorized way by which the Holy Ghost can be conferred 
upon mankind. That is through the ordinance of the lay- 
ing on of hands. We believe in the laying on of hands as one of 
the ordinances Of the gospel ; and when the Church came into exist- 
ence, following that great and mighty vision of the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, about one hundred years ago, when the heavens were opened 
and the Father and the Son made their appearance unto the Prophet 
Joseph, and answered the petition of his humble heart ; from that 
start grew the Church. In the Church came the ordinances of the 
gospel. Among these is the laying on of hands for the gift of the 
Holy Ghost. 

Religious history bears out, it seems to me, the evident fact that, 
in all of God's dealings with the children of men in the various gen- 
erations of the world, when one member of the Godhead is upon 
the earth ministering generally among mankind, another one is taken 
away from the earth. It was altogether possible, no doubt was true, 
when Christ was upon the earth that he at times was visited by the 
Father, and that when he went down into the river Jordan and was 
baptized by John the Baptist, the Holy Ghost descended upon him 
in the form of a dove. We are told also in this sacred writing, that 
John the Baptist had in his soul the Holy Ghost from his mother's 
womb. Yet we find this rather startling declaration recorded in the 
TSible, in the 16th chapter of John and 7th verse, "Nevertheless, I 
tell you the truth, it is expedient that I go away, for if I go not away, 
the Comforter will not come unto you. But if I depart, I will send 
him unto you." Christ, one of the members of the Godhead, was upon 



ELDER URIAH G. MILLER 



63 



the earth. While he was here, that passage of scripture would rather 
give us to understand, that the ministry 7 of the Holy Ghost was not 
universal among the members of the Church. It was necessary that 
Christ should go, and when he went another member of the God- 
head would descend and come and minister unto mankind. My breth- 
ren and sisters, we are living in that day and age of God's dealings 
with the children of men when one personage of the Godhead, the 
Holy Ghost, is ministering among the children of men; and I often 
wonder in our work in the Church, in our ministrations among the 
people, if we do not look for really too marvelous things, if, when we 
kneel down to pray, we do not really expect that the heavens are going 
to be opened and some divine personage is going to come unto us 
and deliver unto us the message that our souls are craving. 

I desire to read to you a passage or two from the Doctrine and 
Covenants dealing with the ministry and the mission of the Holy 
Ghost. These passages of scripture are what came to the Prophet 
Joseph Smith and in behalf of Oliver Cowdery. They were given 
one year before the Church was organized, yet they carry with them 
that wonderful message, that the Holy Ghost is not only for Oliver 
Cowdery but for every member of the Church. It is recorded in the 
6th section, commencing with the 20th verse : 

Behold, thou art Oliver, and I have spoken unto thee because of thy 
desires; therefore treasure up these words in thy heart. Be faithful and dili- 
gent in keeping the commandments of God, and I will encircle thee in the 
arms of my love. Behold, I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God. I am 
the same that came unto my own, and my own received me not. I am the 
light which shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehendeth it not. 
Verily, verily, I say unto you, if you desire a further witness, cast yom 
mind upon the night that you cried unto me in your heart, that you might 
know concerning the truth of these things. Did I not speak peace to 
your mind concerning the matter? What greater witness can you have 
than from God? 

In the 8th section, second verse, these words were recorded : 

Yea, behold, I will tell you in your mind and in your heart, by the 
Holy Ghost, which shall come upon you and which shall dwell in your 
heart. Now, behold, this is the Spirit of revelation; behold, this is the 
Spirit by which Moses brought the children of Israel through the Red Sea 
on dry ground. 

We might read other passages of scripture, if we bad time, show- 
ing the principle, that the Holy Ghost will dwell upon us, be in our 
hearts, to give us peace, contentment, revelation, and those things that 
will lead us to Godliness. 

I pray, my brethren and sisters, God's blessings upon the people 
and members of the Church, that we may be true to every covenant 
that we have made, that the Spirit and the blessings of the Lord may 
rest upon us, and the blessings and power of the Holy Ghost may be 
with us as a witness of this work, which I testify to you is true, in 
the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAWSON 

AFTER ONE HUNDRED YEARS. 

In the year 1820, Joseph Smith had his first vision. After one 
hundred years, what do we see? We behold a great and a mighty 
people in the midst of the Rocky Mountains, organized into a Church 
and founded upon principles and doctrines which he set forth. We 
behold a great conference of the Church here on the 4th day of April, 
1920, and the people of the Latter-day Saints gathered together until 
the Great Tabernacle is filled to overflowing, the Assembly Hall is 
crowded to its utmost limit, and another overflow meeting is now 
in session upon this block, while hundreds have been turned away 
from these buildings because they could not get admission. 

THREE PRECIOUS VOLUMES. 

My brethren and sisters, between these two covers I now hold are 
three precious volumes. They are books that are most precious to the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and to the world at large. 
I take it that these three books are perhaps as desirable and precious 
as any three volumes in the world. One is the Book of Mormon, 
translated by the Prophet Joseph Smith, giving a religious history of 
the ancient people of this continent; also in this book will be found 
the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ in its fulness. This Book of 
Mormon is attested by eleven witnesses, in addition to the Prophet him- 
self who brought it forth. 

The book that follows is the Doctrine and Covenants. It empha- 
sizes the fact that the channel of revelation is open between the heavens 
and the earth, a channel that had been closed for at least 1,800 years. 
Isn't that wonderful? Isn't that impressive, the fact that that chan- 
nel has again been opened ? For, as a mater of fact, this book contains 
the revelations of the Lord Jesus Christ to his prophet and to his 
Church. How blessed are this people, that we can have in the Church 
the voioe of revelation. 

This work is introduced to the Church and to the world by -i 
most powerful preface. I will just read a line or two. It is wonder- 
fully impressive. It emphasizes divine truth : 

Hearken, O ye people of my Church, saith the voice of him who 
dwells on high, and whose eyes are upon all men; yea, verily I say, hearken 
ye people from afar, and ye that are upon the islands of the sea, listen to- 
gether. For verily the voice of the Lord is unto all men, and there is none 
to escape, and there is no eye that shall not see, neither ear that shall not 
hear, neither heart that shall not be penetrated. 

See how comprehensive and how sweeping is this statement, 
every eye shall see and every heart throughout the world shall be 
penetrated by the power of God. • 

And the rebellious shall be pierced with much sorrow, for their in- 
iquities s'hall be spoken upon the housetops, and their secret acts shall be 
revealed. And the voice of warning shall be unto all people, by the mouths 



PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAWSON 



65 



of my disciples, whom I have chosen in these last days. And they shall 
go forth and none shall stay them, for I the Lord have commanded them. 
Behold, this is mine authority, and the authority of my servants, and my 
preface unto the book of my commandments, which I have given them to 
publish unto you, O inhabitants of the earth. (Doc. and Cov. 1:16.) 

The whole section is worthy of the deepest thought. 

And now, in this book of Doctrine and Covenants you will find, 
among the many that have been given, a mighty revelation upon the 
authority of the holy Priesthood. You will also find there a mighty 
revelation with respect to the dead and the temple work, and a mighty 
revelation with regard to the great principle of marriage, and other 
communications from the heavens. Oh, is it not marvelous indeed ! 

The next ' book is the Pearl of Great Price, which is composed 
of writings, narrations, and translations of the Prophet Joseph Smith. 
In this book you will find a record entitled the Book of Moses, show- 
ing how great was the light and truth Jhat was shed forth from God, 
and the dealings of God with his children and the doings of Moses 
and also of Enoch, who lived before the flood. You will also find 
there the Book of Abraham, a translation by the Prophet Joseph Smith, 
which has brought to light a knowledge of great things concerning 
Abraham and his authority and Priesthood, and the revelation of God 
to him concerning the heavens and the earth, all of which is subject 
matter for deep and thoughtful study. And you will further find a 
narration by the Prophet himself of the First Vision referred to. He 
gives an account of it in simple and impressive language. It is beau- 
tiful; the very simplicity of it is beautiful indeed. That communica- 
tion did not come to us in scientific terms. No, it does not need to 
be translated. A child can understand the story of that First Vision, 
it is so simple and beautiful. And we find that the simplest things in 
the world often turn out to be the most profound, do we not? I think 
so. Well, you could hardly put a price on the Pearl of Great Price. 
It is most precious indeed. 

And what a revelation, what a wonderful combination of books 
under one cover. If that were the only book of the kind in the world 
and it was in my possession, dear me, I would not part with it upon 
any consideration. I would hold on to it as I would hold on to my 
soul. I would eat with it and sleep with it, and have it with me at 
all times. But, brethren and sisters, you have this book. How many 
of the Latter-day Saints appreciate these great standard works of the 
Church? How many of the Latter-day Saints are giving them study 
and reflection? We are commanded to search out wisdom from all 
good books, and particularly good books of the Church. 

The Book of Mormon has always been to me as interesting as a 
romance, as interesting to me as any thrilling story that I have ever 
read. It is marvelous, and yet in connection with the story of the 
people of the Nephites is the gospel of Jesus Christ laid before us in 
all its beauty and simplicity. Well, the Lord be praised. Surely this 
is "a marvelous work and a wonder," is it not? You cannot improve 
that definition? There is no use trying to elaborate upon it. You might 



66 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



speak for a month about "Mormonism," and you could not get be- 
yond saying, it is a "marvelous work and a wonder," almost beyond 
human understanding and quite beyond full explanation. 

Well, blessed be the Prophet of the Lord, the living prophet to- 
day ; and blessed be the people of the Latter-day Saints, and now after 
the lapse of a hundred years let us rejoice together in the knowledge 
and testimony of these things. 

APPRECIATION OF THE OGDEN TABERNACLE CHOIR. 

Let me say, in conclusion, and I think very likely I am voicing 
the feeling of the entire congregation, when I say it, that I appreciate 
fully the effort put forth here by the Ogden tabernacle choir, led by 
Brother Joseph Ballantyne. They have done most excellent service 
today, and have helped to make this meeting a splendid success. Of 
course, our meetings are always successful when they are conducted 
under the direction of the Spirit of God, but we could not get along 
without the singing. We must have good singing. We must have 
singing that is tuneful, we must have singing that breathes forth the 
Spirit of God ; we must have singing that is in harmony. And in the 
singing today we have had perfect harmony. The Lord bless the Ogden 
tabernacle choir, and may he bless us all, I pray in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

The quartet, Agnes Warner and choir, sang, 'T Bring You Glad 
Tidings." 

ELDER ANDREW JENSON. 

(Assistant Church Historian) 

My brethren and sisters, I am expected by those who have ap- 
pointed me to address this meeting to give an outline of "Mormon- 
ism" for one hundred years, and with the limited time at my command, 
I can only expect to touch the very high spots, in order to make my 
narrative at all comprehensive and interesting. 

There is a notable similarity between some of the events of the 
first century of the Christian era and those of the nineteenth century. 
With the exception of the experience, which Jesus, when twelve 
years old, had with the Jewish rabbis in Jerusalem, we know next to 
nothing about his childhood days. Several books have been pub- 
lished dealing with Christ as a child, but they are largely, if not wholly, 
apocryphal, and consequently more or less unreliable. No great 
event seems to have taken place in the Savior's life, according to holy 
writ, until he was thirty years of age, when he was baptized by John 
in the river Jordan. With that event was commenced the real preach- 
ing of the gospel, ushering in that particular dispensation at the head 
of which stood Christ and his apostles. Yet we are safe in sur- 
mising that from the time the Savior was twelve years old until he 
was baptized he was training and preparing for the great mission be- 
fore him. 



ELDER ANDREW J EN SON 



67 



So also with the Prophet Joseph Smith, who was born in the be- 
ginning of the nineteenth century. Nothing of importance seems to 
have occurred in his life, until he was between fourteen and fifteen 
years old. Born in Vermont he moved with his parents when ten years 
of age to western New York, where he resided in 1820, one hundred 
years ago, and where he received the glorious vision which may con- 
sistently be termed the very beginning of the new dispensation. The 
following ten years were years of preparation, and during that time 
Joseph was visited by the angel Moroni a number of times, received 
the plates from which he translated the Book of Mormon into the 
English language, was visited by John the Baptist, who confirmed 
upon him and Oliver Cowdery the Aaronic Priesthood, and later 
visited by Peter, James and John who confirmed upon him the Mel- 
chizedek Priesthood. Unfortunately we do not know the exact date 
on which the latter event took plaoe, nor have we been able to es- 
tablish the exact day or days upon which the Three Witnesses and 
the Eight Witnesses to the Book of Mormon saw and handled the plates 
and attached their signatures to the testimonies which are recorded 
at the beginning of that sacred record ; but we are safe in saying that 
these important events took place in 1829. The Book of Mormon 
being published as early as March, 1830, the printing must have been 
commenced in 1829. We are able to state positively that the Book of 
Mormon was published early in 1830, because the Historian's office 
has secured a copy of an old newspaper published in Palmyra, New 
York, which announces the Book of Mormon for sale as early as 
March, 1830. 

While I am speaking about the Book of Mormon, I may say that 
after the first edition of 5,000 copies, printed by Egbert Grandin, 
in Palmyra, New York, a great many other editions have been pub- 
lished of the book, both in America and in England ; and besides being 
thus published in the English language on the two hemispheres the 
book has been translated and published in the Danish, the French, the 
German, the Italian, the Welsh, the Hawaiian, the Swedish, the Span- 
ish, the Maori, the Dutch, the Tahitian, the Turkish and the Japan- 
ese languages, fourteen foreign languages in all. 

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was organized 
on the 6th of April, 1830. With the Priesthood conferred, and in 
possession of the Book of Mormon, which contains the fulness of 
the gospel of Jesus Christ, Joseph Smith became an instrument in 
the hands of the Lord to establish once more upon the earth a true 
Christian Church, according to the divine order, and also in accord- 
ance with the laws of the State of New York. 

It is interesting to note that before the end of the year 1830 
missionaries of the Church had traveled 1300 miles westward from 
the place of organization, and to the Atlantic coast in the other di- 
rection. The gospel was also preached during the fall of 1830, and 
the winter of 1830-1831 to several tribes of Lamanites or Indians, 
some of them beyond the western boundary of the United States, as 
it was then (now the western part of the State of Missouri). Many 



68 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



people were converted and perhaps 200 persons had joined the Church 
by baptism before the close of 1830. Also a number of miraculous 
interpositions of the power of God took place right in the beginning. 
In fact, nearly all the gifts of the Church were manifested in that 
first year, including the gift of healing, prophecy, etc. 

In the year 1831 the Church grew rapidly, not only in the east, 
but also in the western land; and we also find that the first attempt 
at colonization on the part of the Latter-day Saints took place that 
year. When the Church was only 15 months old, the Prophet Joseph 
and others traveled about thirteen hundred miles from Fayette, N. Y., 
to Jackson county, Missouri, where they founded a prosperous colony. 
They set up, among other things, a printing press and published a 
periodical, 120 miles further west than any other paper in the United 
States. This publication, commenced in June, 1832, was the first 
periodical of the Church. It was called the Evening and Morning Star. 
After that followed the Messenger and Advocate, then the Elders 
Journal, next the Times and Seasons, the Millennial Star, the Nauvoo 
Neighbor, the Frontier Guardian, etc., and at length, commencing with 
June, 1850, the Dcseret News, which is the present organ of the 
Church. 

In 1832, also, a dreadful tragedy took place in the town of Hiram, 
Ohio, when the Prophet Joseph was tarred and feathered and left 
for dead, and the life of a little child, adopted by the Prophet and 
his wife Emma, was sacrificed through exposure on account of mob 
violence. Soon after this event the Prophet Joseph made a second 
visit to Missouri to bless and encourage the Saints who were gather- 
ing in Jackson county. His first visit to that State had been made by 
him in the summer of 1831, on which occasion the land of Zion was 
dedicated for the gathering of the Saints and the site of a temple se- 
lected and dedicated. 

In 1833 a mob arose in Jackson county, Missouri, and drove the 
Saints, now numbering about twelve hundred souls, away from their 
homes, having previously destroyed the printing office and other 
property. In that year also the First Presidency of the Church was 
organized, Sidney Rigdon and Frederick G. Williams being ordained 
and set apart as counselors to the Prophet Joseph. This was the be- 
ginning of the First Presidency as it still exists. 

After the expulsion from Jackson county most of the Saints 
settled temporarily across the Missouri river in Clay county, Mis- 
souri, where they made their second attempt at colonizing and were 
again successful. In the meantime the Saints also made a success at 
colonization in Kirtland, Ohio, where they commenced the erection 
of a Temple in 1833, and changed an insignificant village into a town 
of 2,000 people. The Temple built there still stands. 

In 1834 another remarkable event took place in the history of the 
Church. The Saints, who had been driven from Jackson county, 
needed assistance and the Lord called the young men of the Church 
in the Eastern States to go to their relief. Hence the organization of 
Zion's Camp (numbering over two hundred persons) which, led by Jo- 



ELDER ANDREW J EN SON 



69 



seph Smith in person, marched 1,000 miles to Missouri, taking their 
lives in their hands, prepared to sacrifice their all in the interest of their 
persecuted brethren and sisters, who had been so barbarously treated 
by the Jackson county mob. But the Lord did not allow this little 
army to enter into a physical encounter with the mob. In the famous 
revelation given on Fishing river in June, 1834, the Lord said that 
he had brought these young men that far, in order to give them an 
opportunity to show their integrity and their confidence in the Prophet 
of- the Lord. The great majority of them made good, and although 
the Church was only four years old at the time, it was discovered on 
this journey of Zion's Camp that some very good and staunch men 
had already identified themselves with the Church of Christ. Among 
the members of Zion's Camp were such men as Brigham Young, Heber 
C. Kimball, Parley P. and Orson Pratt, Hyrum Smith, Wilford Wood- 
ruff, George A. Smith and many others whose names have become 
household words among the Saints. The journey made by Zion's 
Camp in 1834 compares most favorably with that of the Mormon Bat- 
talion and that of the Utah Pioneers of 1847. In 1834 also the first 
two High Councils in the Church were organized, one in Kirtland, 
Ohio, and the other in Clay county, Missouri. 

In February, 1835, the Prophet Joseph called the young men 
together who had distinguished themselves for their faithfulness and 
integrity as members of Zion's Camp the year before, the Lord hav- 
ing a blessing in store for them. On this occasion twelve of the most 
faithful men in the Church were chosen, mostly from among the mem- 
bers of Zion's Camp, to constitute the first quorum of the Twelve 
Apostles and soon afterwards seventy other men were chosen, mostly 
from the same body, to constitute the first quorum of Seventy. I 
may explain that up to this time the officers in the Priesthood had con- 
sisted of Deacons, Teachers, Priests, Bishops, Elders and High Priests. 

The year 1836 witnessed the dedication of the Kirtland Temple, 
which had been built at a cost of about $100,000. It would indeed be a 
very easy task for the Saints now to erect a Temple like that, but it 
was a most stupendous work for the few, comparatively speaking, 
who at that time constituted the membership of the Church. In that 
Temple the Saints received great blessings and witnessed many grand 
and glorious manifestations of the power of God. Jesus Christ him- 
self appeared to some of the brethren in that Temple and declared 
that he had accepted of the building which had been built and dedi- 
cated to his name. Moses also appeared in that holy edifice and com- 
mitted to the Prophet Joseph the keys for the gathering of Israel from 
the four quarters of the globe, an event which is responsible for the 
many nationalities represented in the Church at the present time. 
Elijah the prophet, who was taken into heaven without tasting death, 
also appeared in the Kirtland Temple and conferred to men in mor- 
tality the keys for turning the hearts of the fathers to the children 
and the hearts of the children to their fathers, lest the whole earth 
should be smitten with a curse, as predicted by the prophet Malachi. 

In passing, I will say, that the Kirtland Temple was not provided

with a baptismal font, nor rooms for ordinance work; it simply provided 
a sacred place for Christ and other heavenly messengers to appeal 
and restore certain keys to the brethren and confer blessings upon 
the people. It also provided a place for schools of learning for the 
priesthood. This year (1836) the Saints in Missouri were compelled 
to leave their possessions in Clay county and move into a prairie coun- 
try which soon afterwards was organized into Caldwell county. When 
the Saints moved into that county it was inhabited only by two or 
three families who made their living by gathering honey, but in the 
course of three years the Saints turned that naked prairie country 
into beautiful farms and. gardens. In Caldwell county they founded 
the city of Far West and many other villages ; in the adjoining Daviess 
county they located Adam-ondi-Ahman on Grand river, and in Car- 
roll county they purchased the little town of De Witt. They increased 
so rapidly in that part of upper Missouri that in 1838 there were as 
many thousand Saints there as there had formerly been hundreds in 
Jackson county. 

In 1837 the first Latter-day Saint missionaries were sent to Eng- 
land where they commenced that great missionary labor which has 
resulted in so many thousands of Latter-day Saints from the British 
Isles migrating to America to become a most important factor in the 
growth of the Church. The British Mission was a natural outgrowth 
of missionary labors performed by Parley P. Pratt in 1836, in the 
Dominion of Canada, where John Taylor, a staunch and influential 
Englishman, who subsequently became president of the Church, be- 
lieved the testimony of Brother Pratt and was baptized, together with 
many others. 

In 1838 persecution by mobs was renewed in Caldwell county 
and that season became a veritable year of martyrdom. We are all 
familiar with the fact that seventeen Saints were massacred at Haun's 
Mill on the 30th of October, 1838, and that David W. Patten, one of 
the original members of the quorum of the Twelve Apostles, and 
others were killed about the same time on Crooked river. During 
that year, also, the Prophet Joseph and others were thrown into filthy 
dungeons as prisoners and kept in durance vile for many months. 

In 1839 the exodus of about 12,000 Saints from Missouri took 
place under the exterminating order of Gov. Lilburn W. Boggs. The 
exiled Saints fled to Illinois and there, during the following six years, 
founded and built up the city of Nauvoo, in Hancock county. I will 
here merely mention that attempts had previously been made by oth- 
ers to build up a town on the same site, but instead of building a 
town they built a good-sized graveyard on the side hill. Our people, 
"plucked and peeled," as they were, built up a city containing about 
15,000 inhabitants. In Church history this city is known as Nauvoo 
the Beautiful. It stood on the east bank of the Mississippi river 
where that mighty stream changes its course so as to make a horse- 
shoe bend and on the projected area thus formed and bounded on 
three sides by the river, the city was built. There is still a remnant 
of Nauvoo left, but it is a matter of history that as soon as the Saints 



ELDER ANDREW J EN SON 



71 



took their departure for the far west an apparent blight or curse set- 
tled down upon the place, and has rested upon it ever since. Instead 
of being the largest city in Illinois, as it was in 1846, Nauvoo of to- 
day is a small insignificant village, suffering under the displeasure 
of God as literally as does the land of Palestine which was placed un- 
der a curse because of the wickedness of its inhabitants. 

In 1840 the Saints petitioned the President and Congress of the 
United States for redress for the persecutions endured by them in 
Missouri, but their prayer was met with this laconic answer from the 
chief executive of the nation: "Your cause is just, but I can do noth- 
ing for you." That year (1840) a number of the Twelve Apostles 
arrived in England as missionaries, Brigham Young, Heber C. Kim- 
ball, Parley P. Pratt, Wilford Woodruff and Geo. A. Smith being 
among the number. These brethren commenced the publication of the 
Millennial Star, which is still published in England and is now the 
oldest periodical in the Church. 

The year 1841 witnessed the laying of the foundation of a Temple 
in Nauvoo and the forming of the Nauvoo Legion for the protection 
of the Saints. This military organization was continued many years 
after the Saints located in Utah, and some of the brethren who are 
present today undoubtedly belonged to the Nauvoo Legion. 

In 1842 Joseph Smith was troubled with vexatious lawsuits. Dur- 
ing his lifetime it is asserted that he was arrested forty-seven times, 
but was acquitted in every instance ; and when his enemies finally 
found that they could not prove him guilty of any crime, or even mis- 
demeanor, they swore that "if the law could not touch him, powder 
and ball would." 

In 1843 enemies made another attempt to kidnap Joseph and take 
him to Missouri, but the Saints of Nauvoo, who loved their. Prophet 
as they loved no other man, except it be Christ himself, rose up in 
righteous indignation in his defense, and with the Nauvoo Legion at 
their back rescued their Prophet and brought him safely back to 
Nauvoo. 

The year 1844 witnessed the assassination of the Prophet Joseph. 
He fell as a martyr to the cause of truth, together with his brother 
Hyrum and others. 

In 1845 the mob burned nearly all the houses outside of Nauvoo, 
and in 1846 they sacked Nauvoo itself. A number of brethren were 
killed in the so-called Nauvoo battle and on other occasions. Early 
in 1846 the Saints made preparations to move westward into the land 
of the setting sun, and in February of that year, when the weather 
was so cold that the frost formed a natural bridge across the great 
Mississippi river, the exodus of the Saints commenced. One com- 
pany of Saints from the Eastern States, instead of crossing the con- 
tinent, traveled by sea, doubling Cape Horn and landed at the little 
Spanish village called Yerba Buena on the Bay of San Francisco, 
July 31, 1846. This company published a paper called the California 
Star and turned the village of Yerba Buena into the present town 
of San Francisco. i

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



After the Saints in 1846 had traveled westward about three hun- 
dred miles from Nauvoo a request reached them from the United 
States government for five hundred men to participate in the war with 
Mexico, and while some of the Saints demurred on the ground that 
they needed "all the able-bodied men in their camps to protect them- 
selves against the Indians, President Brigham Young answered the 
government messenger by saying: "You shall have your battalion, 
even if we have to make it up of our Elders," and, sure, enough, the 
Elders, Priests, Teachers and Deacons of the Church were mustered 
into that battalion which commenced its famous march toward Cal- 
ifornia in July, 1846. It is said that these volunteer soldiers made 
the most difficult march ever undertaken by infantry in any mili- 
tary campaign. The so-called sick detachment of the battalion, which 
was not considered strong enough to undertake the march all the way 
across the deserts to California, was sent to a place now called Pueblo, 
on the Arkansas river, where they spent the winter of 1846-1847, and 
thus became the first Anglo-Saxon settlers in what is now the State 
of Colorado. 

Having served their time according to enlistment the Mormon 
Battalion was discharged in California in July, ' 1847, and early in 
1848 some of the members discovered gold in California, an event 
which for a while almost turned the world upside down. 

Most of the exiles from Nauvoo spent the winter of 1846-1847 
on the west bank of the Missouri river, where they built a town called 
Winter Quarters, the first Anglo-Saxon settlement in what is now 
the State of Nebraska. This was done because the Mormon Battalion 
took away so many of the stronger men that the rest of the exiles 
could not continue the journey to the mountains that season, as had 
been contemplated, but in April, 1847, a company, known in history 
as the pioneers, consisting of 143 men, three women and two chil- 
dren, left Winter Quarters for the Rocky Mountains and arrived in 
Great Salt Lake Valley in July, 1847. About one thousand eight 
hundred others of the exiled Saints arrived in the valley in the fall 
and spent the winter of 1847-1848 in the valley. 

Early in 1848 the pioneers in the Valley put in crops which from 
the beginning promised a rich harvest, and for a while everything 
looked promising and encouraging, but in the early part of the sum- 
mer crickets came down in myriads from the mountains surrounding 
Great Salt Lake Valley and destroyed a great portion of the crops. 
Notwithstanding every effort was made to drive them off by means 
of bushes, long rods, etc., whole families and neighbors turning out 
en masse until almost exhausted, the whole would have been destroyed, 
had not the Almighty in his kindness sent gulls in vast numbers which 
covered the fields and destroyed the crickets. This circumstanoe saved 
the life of the colony which during the winter of 1847-1848 had lived 
on half rations and their whole hope of escaping starvation was cen- 
tered on the harvest of 1848. They could not possibly have lived 
through another winter, nor could the four thousand other emi- 
grants who arrived in the valley in 1848 have escaped starvation if 



ELDER ANDREW J EN SON 



73 



the harvest of 1848 had proved a failure. Hence, when we view the 
beautiful statue erected on this block in honor of the sea gulls we may 
well offer up a prayer of thanksgiving for what these birds did for 
the pioneers of Utah. 

While everything looked dreary and blue in Salt Lake Valley 
in 1848 and clothing of every description as well as foot gear was so 
extremely scarce that some of the men were obliged to make cloth- 
ing of skins, Heber C. Kimball, as a prophet of the Lord, on a certain 
occasion arose in the midst of a congregation of Saints and said that 
within one year States goods would be sold on the streets of Salt Lake 
City as cheap as in the city of New York. After uttering the prophecy, 
Bro. Kimball remarked that it seemed almost impossible for his pre- 
diction to be fulfilled; nor did the brethren who heard him place any 
confidence in his words. Yet the prophecy was fulfilled in a most 
natural way in 1849, when tens of thousands of gold diggers from the 
east and from Europe passed through Salt Lake City on their way to 
the gold mines in California. Being anxious to continue their jour- 
ney without delay these travelers were willing to exchange their 
States goods for fresh cattle and supplies of food, and thus were 
the wants of the people, so far as clothing was concerned, relieved, 
while the gold miners could continue their journey rejoicing. In 1849 
Provo in Utah county and Manti in Sanpete county were founded, 
Ogden having been founded the year before. Early in 1849 the people 
in the valley organized the Provisional Government of the State of Des- 
eret which was the only general government here for more than two 
years or until the machinery of the Territory of Utah came into 
existence in 1851. I could say much about this government and the 
conditions in the Valley, showing the loyalty and the good character 
of the Saints during those years, but time will not permit. In 1849 
missionary operations, which on account of the exodus had been neg- 
lected for a few years, were revived, as missionaries were not only 
called to the United States and Great Britain but to continental Europe. 
Thus it was that new missions were opened up among many people 
who do not speak the English language, among them being missions 
to France, Italy, Denmark, Sweden and the Hawaiian Islands. 

In 1850 a string of new settlements was founded in Utah Valley, 
including Lehi, American Fork, Pleasant Grove, Springville, Spanish 
Fork, and Payson. 

In 1851 the government pertaining to the Territory of Utah 
(which had been created the year before) was set in motion and Fill- 
more, Millard county, chosen as the first capital of Utah. That year 
also Brigham City, Willard, Nephi, Parowan, Cedar City and other 
settlements of the Saints were founded in Utah and besides these, San 
Bernardino in California. This year Great Salt Lake City was made 
an incorporated city with Jedediah M. Grant as the first mayor. New 
missions were opened by the Church in South America, Australia, 
India, Switzerland, Norway and Iceland. 

In 1852 nearly all the Saints who had stopped temporarily in the 
Pottawattamie country in Iowa emigrated to the Valley. 



74 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



In 1853 the so-called Walker war broke out in Utah, in which a 
number of the settlers were killed. Fort Supply, near Fort Bridger, 
was founded by the Saints. This was the first Anglo-Saxon settle- 
ment in what is now the State of Wyoming. This year also the first 
branches of the Church were organized in Sweden. 

In 1854 hundreds of emigrating Saints from Europe died from 
cholera while sailing up the Mississippi river and while crossing the 
plains. New missions of the Church were opened in New Zealand 
and in Gibraltar. 

In 1855 the grasshoppers destroyed nearly all the crops in Utah. 
A colony of Saints was established in Carson Valley (now Nevada) 
and a missionary settlement founded near Salmon River in what is 
now the State of Idaho, this being the first Anglo-Saxon settlement 
in that State. 

Owing to the destruction of the crops in 1855 food was very 
scarce ih Utah during the early part of 1856, but the lives of the 
people were saved by their eating thistle tops and sego roots. In 1856 
upwards of two thousand Saints crossed the plains with handcarts, 
and as many more during following years. 

In 1857 the so-called Johnston army troubles occurred, through 
the falsehoods circulated by Judge W. W. Drummond and others. 
This army was sent to Utah to punish the "Mormons" who were ac- 
cused of being disloyal to the government. The Utah militia mustered 
into service by proclamation by Gov. Brigham Young, stopped the 
army temporarily and the troops spent the winter of 1857-1858 near 
Fort Bridger. 

In 1858 through the good offices of Thos. L. Kane and peace 
commissioners the difficulties existing between the U. S. government 
and the citizens of Utah were settled and the army entered the Valley, 
but not until the inhabitants had vacated Salt Lake City and the 
northern settlements. They, however, returned to their homes. 

In 1859 the Federal judges in Utah exercised undue authority 
and caused considerable difficulty by instituting unjust court proceed- 
ings against Church leaders and others. 

In 1860 the so-called pony express was introduced which made 
communication between Utah and the east and California much easier. 

In 1861 Utah was divided and Nevada came into existence as a 
territory, afterwards as a state. That year also upwards of two 
hundred wagons, with four yoke of cattle to each, were sent from 
Utah to the Missouri river to bring in the poor Saints who were emi- 
grating to the vallev. This movement on the part of the Church was 
repeated in 1862, 1863, 1864, 1866, and 1868. This year (1861) the 
overland telegraph line was completed to Salt Lake City. 

In 1862 another convention was held in Utah which re-adopted 
with slight amendments, the constitution of 1856. Delegates were 
sent to Washington to ask for Utah's admission into the Union as a 
state ; the request was again refused. In 1862 Camp Douglas was estab- 
lished, near Salt Lake City, by California volunteers.

In 1863 new settlements of Saints were founded in Sevier Val- 
ley, Utah, and Bear Lake Valley, Idaho. 

In 1864 Calls Landing was established by the Saints on the Colo- 
others were subsequently called. The first "Mormon" settlements in 
Arizona. 

In 1865 the so-called Black Hawk war broke out in Southern 
Utah and continued for three years, during which about 75 people 
were killed and thousands of head of stock taken off by the Indians. 
In consequence of these raids and massacres the counties of Piute 
and Sevier were abandoned as well as some of the small settlements 
and ranches in Kane county. 

In 1866 ten companies of Church teams were sent to the Missouri 
river after the poor. 

In 1867 the large tabernacle in Salt Lake City was nearly com- 
pleted. 

In 1868 nearly all the crops in Utah were destroyed by grass- 
hoppers. In order to create employment for the people, that they 
might earn means to buy bread, President Brigham Young took a 
contract to grade ninety miles of the Union Pacific Railroad. Thus 
work and money became plentiful in Utah. 

In 1869 the Union Pacific Railroad was completed to Ogden and 
on May 10th, 1869, the last rail connecting the Union Pacific and 
the Central Pacific railroads was laid at Promontory. This put an 
end to the long and tedious travel across the continent by ox teams. 
In January, 1870, the Utah Central Railroad was completed to Salt 
Lake City, thus making the capital of Utah a railroad town. 

In February, 1871, the settlements of the Saints on the Muddy, 
now in Lincoln county, Nevada, were abandoned by them, owing to 
oppressive taxation by the officials of the new State of Nevada. That 
year also Judge James B. McKean, who had recently been appointed 
chief justice in Utah, united with the associate justice in setting 
the laws of the territory at defiance, which led to considerable dis- 
turbance, as under his rulings civil and religious liberty almost de- 
parted from Utah for the time being, and tyranny usurped their 
places. 

Early in 1872 another constitutional convention met in Salt 
Lake City to adopt mesaures anew for the admission of Utah into the 
Union. A constitution and a memorial to Congress were finally 
adopted which provided for woman's suffrage and minority represen- 
tation. When it was submitted to the people for their vote 25,324 
persons voted for it and only 368 against it. In May the memorial was 
presented to Congress, but admission of the State of Deseret into 
the Union was denied because of the unpopularity of the religion of 
the Latter-day Saints. 

In 1873 an unsuccessful attempt was made by a company of 
Saints to settle in Arizona territory. President Geo. A. Smith visited 
Palestine and other countries. 

In 1874 a large number of Indians joined the Church and the 
United Order was introduced among the Saints in Utah. 



76 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



In 1875 Geo. A. Smith, first counselor to President Brigham 
Young, and Church historian, died in Salt Lake City. 

In 1876 a large number of families in Utah were called by the 
Church authorities to locate settlements of the Saints in Arizona; 
others were subsequently called. The first "Mormon" settlements in 
Arizona were founded on the Little Colorado river. There are now 
about fifty settlements of the Saints in Arizona, comprising four 
Stakes of Zion. 

In April, 1877, the Temple in St. George was dedicated on the 
occasion of a general conference of the Church being held within 
its sacred walls. The erection of that temple, the first in Utah, was 
commenced in November, 1871. During the year, 1877, under the 
direction of President Brigham Young, a general re-organization of 
all the settlements of the Saints took place, regular Stakes of Zion 
being organized in the different counties in Utah and also in Idaho 
and Arizona, where the Saints resided. No sooner was this import- 
ant organization completed than President Brigham Young, who had 
presided over the Church 33 years, took sick and died in Salt Lake 
City, August 29, 1877. After his death the Twelve Apostles, with 
John Taylor at their head, took the lead in all matters pertaining to 
the Church for three years. 

In 1878 a number of Mexican claims were purchased by the 
Saints in Conejos county, Colorado, where several "Mormon" set- 
tlements were subsequently located ; they now constitute the San Luis 
stake of Zion. 

In May, 1879, Daniel H. Wells was imprisoned in the terri- 
torial penitentiary for alleged contempt of court. The offense consisted 
in his refusal to disclose the secrets of the Endowment House. In 
July Elder Joseph Standing was shot and killed by a mob near Var- 
nell station, Whitfield county, Georgia, where he had labored as a 
missionary. The murderers of Elder Standing were subsequently all 
identified and three of them arraigned in court in Dalton, Georgia, on 
the charge of murder in the first degree, but, although the evidence 
against them was clear and direct, they were acquitted by a wicked 
and bigoted jury and an unrighteous judge. 

In April, 1880, the Church celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of 
its organization by a Jubilee conference held in Salt Lake City, at 
which the people voted to remit $820,000 of the indebtedness to the 
P. E. Fund in favor of the worthy poor and to distribute 1,000 cows 
and 5,000 sheep among the needy, all -of which was done. In October, 
1880, the First Presidency of the Church was once more reorganized, 
John Taylor being chosen president with George Q. Cannon and 
Joseph F. Smith, counselors. 

In 1881, Gov. Eli H. Murray of Utah put himself on record in 
a most unusual manner by issuing a certificate of election to Allen 
G. Campbell, the minority candidate for delegate to Congress from 
Utah, although George Q. Cannon had been properly elected by an 
overwhelming majority. 

In 1882 the* so-called Edmunds anti-polygamy bill was passed by 



ELDER ANDREW J EN SON 



77 



the U. S. Senate. Under this bill a large number of leading breth- 
ren were arrested in Utah, Idaho and Arizona, charged with so-called 
unlawful co-habitation, and about one thousand men were imprisoned 
in the Utah Penitentiary and elsewhere for refusing to desert their 
wives and children. That year (1882) another convention was held in 
Utah which adopted another constitution and memorial to Congress, 
praying that Utah be admitted into the Union as a State, but Congress 
again refused to accede to the wishes of the people of Utah. 

In 1883 the Logan temple was finished and dedicated. 

In 1884 Elders Wm. L. Berry and John H. Gibbs and others 
were cruelly murdered by a mob in Tennessee for no other crime than 
that they were Latter-day Saints. 

In 1887 President John Taylor, who had been in exile for some 
time, died in Kaysville, Utah. The Twelve Apostles again came 
to the front as the presiding authorities of the Church with Wilford 
Woodruff, the senior Apostle, at their head. 

In 1888 the missionaries were quite successful in their labors, 
especially on the islands of the sea, including Samoa, where the ful- 
ness of the gospel was introduced that year. A temple was com- 
pleted and dedicated in Manti, Sanpete county. 

In April, 1889, a First Presidency was again sustained by the 
Saints, Wilford Woodruff being' unanimously chosen as President 
of the Church with George O. Cannon as his first and Joseph F. 
Smith as his second counselor. 

In 1890 the municipal government of Salt Lake City passed from 
the hands of the Saints represented by the People's Party into those of 
the so-called Liberal Party which for many years past had represented 
the anti-"Mormon" faction of the territory. The Liberal city council 
took possession in February and immediately inaugurated a reign of 
extravagance and blunders. Until this transfer Salt Lake City was 
one of the best governed cities in the world, life and property had 
been safe, peace and order the prominent characteristics of the com- 
munity, and taxation light. But no sooner had the Liberals come 
into power than the city became a regular rendezvous for tramps, 
footpads and burglars, etc. Vile houses of resort, gambling hells, 
saloons, and other places of evil, multiplied and were at the close of 
the year in full operation with but little check, even on the Sabbath 
day. At the general conference of the Church held in Salt Lake 
City in October, 1890, the Saints voted unanimously to discontinue 
polygamous marriages, agreeable to the provisions of the manifesto 
issued by President Wilford Woodruff and dated Sept. 24, 1890. 

The year 1891 witnessed the Saints in Utah dividing on party 
lines ; the old People's Party was disorganized and the majority of 
the members of the Church joined, or acted in unison with, the two 
great national parties of the land, the Democrats and Republicans, 
according to their individual preference. 

In 1892 missionary work was re-commenced on the Society and 
Tuamotu Islands ; for forty years the Saints of those islands had been 
left without the guidance of Elders from Zion. 



78 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



In April, 1893, the Temple in Salt Lake City was dedicated. It had 
been in course of erection forty years, and its estimated cost was 
$4,000,000. It was by far the largest Temple erected by the Church 
up to that time. 

In 1894 President Grover Cleveland pardoned all polygamists and 
restored them to their civil rights. 

In 1895 a State constitution was made and adopted by the Con- 
stitutional Convention held in Salt Lake City and every preparation 
made for Utah's admission into the Union as a State. President 
Grover Cleveland signed the proclamation which admitted Utah into 
the sisterhood of States Jan. 4, 1896. The occasion was honored by 
grand celebrations in Salt Lake City and other places in the new 
State. 

In 1897 Utah celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the arrival 
of the Pioneers in Great Salt Lake Valley. 

In 1898 President Wilford Woodruff died and the First Presi- 
dency of the Church was re-organized with Lorenzo Snow as presi- 
dent. In 1899 settlements of the Saints were organized in the Big 
Horn Basin in Wyoming, several quorums of Seventies were organ- 
ized and the misionaries of the Church met with considerable success in 
their administrations abroad. The close of the century found the 
Church in a most healthy condition. There were 43 Stakes of Zion, 
comprising about 400 wards and eighteen missionary fields in the 
United States and in foreign lands. The total membership of the 
Church numbered about 400,000 in the whole world 

The next decade witnessed many changes and steady progress 
for the Church. President Lorenzo Snow died in 1901, and the First 
Presidency of the Church was re-organized with Joseph F. Smith 
as president and John R. Winder and Anthon H. Lund as counselors. 
Many new wards were organized in 1902, a Bureau of Information 
was established on the Temple block, in Salt Lake City, and a new 
mission house was built and dedicated in Copenhagen, Denmark. In 
1903 the Book of Mormon was published in the Samoan language and a 
new mission house was built and dedicated in Denver, Colorado. In 
1904, Salt Lake City was divided into four stakes, a number of promi- 
nent Church people were summoned to Washington, D. C, to testify 
before the Senate committee on Privileges and Elections in the Smoot 
case, and a mission house, purchased and remodeled by the Church, was 
dedicated in Stockholm, Sweden. The railway connecting Salt Lake 
City with southern California was completed, the Church purchased 
the old Mack farm in Vermont and erected a monument thereon, 
which was dedicated Dec. 23, 1905. The Church opened a mission 
field in ancient Greece. In 1906 President Joseph F. Smith made a 
trip to Europe ; it was the first time in the history of the Church that 
a president of the Church visited Europe. In 1907 the First Presi- 
dency of the Church issued a significant address to the world, stating 
the policy and belief of the Church. During the following four years 
several new stakes of Zion and a number of new wards were or- 
ganized.

During the decade commencing with 1911 a great many taber- 
nacles, meetinghouses and chapels were erected. The missionaries 
met with considerable opposition in some of the European countries. 
Most of the Saints were forced to leave Mexico in 1912, owing to the 
revolution in that land. Permanent missionary homes were secured 
and dedicated in Chicago, Illinois, and in Los Angeles, California, 
in 1913. A site for a temple was dedicated in Alberta, Canada. Presi- 
dent Joseph F. Smith died in Salt Lake City Nov. 19, 1918, and the 
First Presidency was re-organized a few days later with Heber J. 
Grant as President and Anthon H. Lund and Charles W. Penrose 
as counselors. In November, 1919, the newly erected Temple in 
Hawaii was dedicated by President Heber J. Grant, and early in 1920 
a site for a temple was selected in Mesa, Arizona. 

Now a word in conclusion, comparing the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints, with the primitive Christian Church. When one 
hundred years had passed over the original church all the Apostles, 
save one, and many others, had been martyred, while great numbers of 
the early Christians had apostatized from the faith. If we compare 
our position, with theirs, our hearts will rejoice that we live in the 
latter days. If we had lived in the days of the Savior and his apos- 
tles, and had belonged to that dispensation, we might have had the 
privilege of falling as martyrs, or perhaps we might have denied 
the faith. But living in this day, we are members of a Church grow- 
ing year by year, and now stronger than ever before. At least half a 
million people constitute the membership of "the Church at the 
present time, and instead of having dead apostles, we have a live 
First Presidency, twelve live apostles, more than two hundred quor- 
ums of seventy and quorums of high priests and other orders of the 
Priesthood in every stake of the Church. As a Church organization 
we have grown until there are seventy-nine stakes of Zion and nearly 
one thousand wards and branches of the Church in these mountains 
alone, to say nothing of our membership in foreign lands, and still we 
are safe in saying that "Mormonism" is only singing, as it were, on its 
first verse. So much having been accomplished during the past one 
hundred years, what will not be witnessed in the next hundred years 
to come? For as a Church we are here to stay and grow until our 
influence for good shall be felt to the ends of the earth. Let us 
remember that it has cost some of the best blood of the nineteenth 
century to accomplish that which has already been done. Let us re- 
member, too, the services of Zion's Camp, the Mormon Battalion, the 
Pioneers of 1847, and the many other faithful men and women who 
have made sacrifices for us, and through whose labors and faithfulness 
we today enjoy all the blessings that come within the reach of those 
who keep the commandments of God. 

May God bless us all that we may always remain faithful and 
true, is my earnest praver in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir with William S. Wright, Mildred Ware and Myrtle 
B. Higley sang, "Is This the Messiah?"

ELDER NEPHI JENSEN 

(President of the Canadian Mission) 

One Sunday afternoon last December I spoke in the Queen's 
Square Theatre in St. Johns, New Brunswick. At the close of the 
meeting a good Irish business man invited me to spend the evening at 
his home. I accepted the invitation and passed two delightful hours 
with this new found friend, talking about religion. My host was an 
old man, who had never joined a church. In fact for a number of 
years he had taken pleasure in detecting indications of the derth of 
spirituality in the popular churches. In the course of our conversa- 
tion he told a story of a good Christian woman who had the mis- 
fortune of breaking her arm. She believed in the old faith and re- 
quested one of the pastors of St. John to come and pray for her 
recovery. A reverend gentleman went to her~ room and looked 
through his prayer book for a prayer suitable for the occasion. After 
some fruitless search, he shook his head and said, "I can find a 
prayer for rheumatism, and a broken leg, but I cannot find a prayer 
for a broken arm. I am sorry that I cannot pray for you." (Laughter.) 

When I heard this story I was reminded of what Bill Nye wrote 
in his comic History of The United States about the religion of the 
first settlers of New England. He said, "The Pilgrims came to Amer- 
ica because they did not believe in elocutionary prayers." I am 
thankful that I belong to a Church that does not believe in. "elocu- 
tionary prayers," or "sermons." 

Our religion commenced with the sincere prayer of a boy. God's 
own hand rocked its cradle, and his inspiring Spirit has unfailingly 
guided its destiny until it has become a mighty power for human puri- 
fication and ennoblement. 

I am deeply thankful for the opportunity of coming home to par- 
ticipate with you in the celebration of the glorious centennial anni- 
versary of Joseph Smith's first prayer. The day that boy first prayed 
openly is one of the holiest days in the history of the human race. 
His intense faith-cry to God that day was the noblest act of the 
noblest soul except One. It marked the beginning of one of the great- 
est epochs in the history of religion. It started the real modern spirit- 



ELDER NEPHI JENSON 



81 



ual renaissance. For that day the true meaning of prayer was dis- 
covered for modern man. 

True prayer is the soul of true religion. It distinguishes religion 
from superstition. As long as men pray from the heart with real 
faith they will retain some actual assurance of the existence of the 
true God. 

When the Christ taught men how to pray the simple, undoubting 
prayer of faith, he gave to the human race its mightiest instrumentality. 
But alas, man lost this key to actual communion with his Maker. In 
the middle ages paganism drove truth from the altar and living faith 
from the human heart. The simple religion of prayer and "worship 
in spirit and in truth," was turned into a gaudy show. Superstition killed 
living belief, and dead formalism drove out of the sanctuary the simple 
heart-yearning prayer that seeks and finds, asks and receives. 

Joseph Smith, the great modern prophet, discovered the lost 
meaning of prayer. With a heart that did not stagger at the thought 
of trusting the invisible God, he cried to the God of heaven for wis- 
dom, and he received what he asked for. By the power of his mighty 
faith he called to earth the Father of all, and his Son Jesus Christ. 
Because he trusted implicitly in the words : "If any of you lack 
wisdom, let him ask of God," he was privileged to hear the awful Voice 
that had stilled the storm and stayed the wave. 

The story of that boy's all-conquering faith is the most thrilling 
incident in modern annals. There is light, life and hope in it. It is the 
beacon that lights the way across the dark chasm which centuries 
of ignorance and superstition have placed between God and man. Be- 
cause that boy asked and received, thousands who have come after 
him have been able to ask and receive. 

We are the legatees of the faith and truth that Prophet bequeathed 
to the modern world. Many of us have followed his example and 
have sought and found the soul-satisfying knowledge of God. I have 
asked and received. Without the slightest hesitancy I can say that I 
know God answers prayer, as certainly as I know that light is light. 

Men come from afar and witness what the Latter-day Saints have 
accomplished in this intermountain region, and go away deeply im- 
pressed with these achievements. Often when these men" are ap- 
proached on the subject of "Mormonism" they say, "I care nothing 
about your religion, but I am greatly interested in what you people 
have accomplished." This is a very superficial commentary upon the 
history of the Latter-day Saints. For, apart from the living faith 
taught and exemplified by our Prophet, the Latter-day Saints would 
not have been able to accomplish any more than any other people. 

It was living faith in a living, personal God that gave them for- 
titude to sacrifice all that they might be true to him who was their 
All in All. It was not mere human ingenuity that selected this place, 
which is now secluded from the industrial turmoil of the rest of our 
country, as a resting place for modern Israel. It was true inspiration 
which first said, "This is the place !" It was not a mere sense of the 
strength in unity that sent this people out in concert to make roads, 



82 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



build bridges, construct irrigation canals, and erect splendid temples 
and tabernacles. A deeper spirit was the inspiring cause of all these 
achievements. "God has spoken again :" This was the all-impelling 
thought that banded the Saints together as the heart of one man in their 
great enterprises. All that the Saints have risked and suffered, all 
that they have ventured and accomplished, all that they have sacrificed 
for the salvation of mankind, has been suffered, accomplished and 
sacrificed in the name of and by the power of the faith that Joseph 
Smith discovered one hundred years ago. 

This vital faith puts man in actual contact with God. It is the 
one thing the world most needs today. Everywhere I find pathetic 
proof of the lack of this inspiring belief in God. I detect it in the in- 
sipid singing in the sectarian churches. I notice it in their hollow 
prayers. I discover it in their old sermons that speak of a distant God 
in high sounding theological phrases. 

Last Sunday afternoon I was more than usually impressed with 
the sectarian lack of the power to get in contact with God. I at- 
tended a Pentecostal meeting in Winnipeg, Canada. At this meeting 
I saw an audience of several hundred people, who have discovered the 
hollowness and coldness of modern religion. These people were hon- 
estly but vainly striving, in song and prayer and sermon, to get close 
to the Father of All. In their hearts they sincerely desired to "touch 
the hem of his garment." But alas, they could not. They were com- 
pelled to look across nineteen silent centuries for a real palpable in- 
stance of the manifestation of the power of God. When they tried 
to look up trustingly, the doubting thought, "God has not done anything 
during all these centuries," would drive faith from their hearts. And 
so they "cry aloud, and the only answer that comes is the wail of their 
echoing cry." 

But how different with the Latter-day Saints ! They are able to 
look up with undoubting trust in the God who not only did great 
things many centuries ago but who has made bare his arm to the 
nations in the day and time in which we live. In our hearts we can 
say, "I cannot doubt God, for in our own time he answered the prayer 
of the boy Joseph Smith. He has sent holy angels to the earth with 
truth, graces, powers and authorities. He has indeed "proceeded to 
do a marvelous work and a wonder, among this people." 

The world today socially and politically is rocking. It is sitting 
upon a volcano. God only knows what tomorrow will bring forth. And 
why is there so much unrest and instability all over the world? Why is 
every man's hand raised against his neighbor? Why has the world 
with the two thoughts "money and fun" turned the world into a fool's 
paradise? The answer to these questions is found in a very short 
sentence: — The world has lost faith in God. With the loss of faith, it 
lost the sense of moral obligation. 

The great philosopher Emanuel Kant said, "Two things inspire me 
with awe, the starry heavens and human accountability." This sense 
of "human responsibility" to God is the only thing upon which enduring 
civilization can be built. The world more than anything else needs 



ELDER NEPHI JENSON 



83 



an intensified consciousness of its responsibility to Almighty God. 
Nothing but the living, vital faith that our Prophet discovered one 
hundred years ago can bring back to the human race the awful 
thought, "There is a great final Judge to whom we are. responsible 
for all our thoughts, aspirations and acts." Only this thought will 
bring peace to the nations. 

So let us be thankful, my brothers and sisters, that we are the 
legatees of the riches of faith and truth that the great Prophet of the 
latter days received from God. Let us remember that a testimony of 
these things is the only sure anchor of the soul. Let us remember 
that outside of this testimony all is uncertainty, all is doubt, all is des- 
pair. But with this firmly rooted testimony in our hearts our souls 
can be calm, for we can endure as seeing the Divine Weaver behind the 
tangled web of life, making all things come out right for those who 
do right. 

God help us to treasure this testimony, I ask in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen.

ELDER HEBER C. IVERSON 

(President of the Northwestern States Mission) 

The thought expressed by President Jensen that the world, today, 
politically, socially, and religiously, is rocking, I will beg the priv- 
ilege of stating just a little differently, and emphatically. I believe 
that it is so rocking because it is not founded upon the rock of revela- 
tion, as is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, con- 
cerning which foundation the Lord himself said; "the gates of hell 
cannot prevail." 

The time is now here, predicted of old, when all that can be shaken 
will be shaken, and, truly human institutions are being shaken and will 
fall. 

This morning President Lund called our attention to the fact that 
the so-called Christian denominations, in convention, have ruled us 
out of their society, as un-Christian, because we are not believers, say 
they, in the divinity of Jesus Christ, the Redeemer of the world. If 
we are not, I would like to know who are ! That thought suggested 
to me two very significant articles I recently read and happened to copy 
a few excerpts from. These notes, with your permission I will read 
with such comments as I may be led to make. 

In the Literary Digest of December 20, 1919, the following article 
appeared under the heading of "The Church in a Looking-Glass :" 

An inquiry which seems to test the results of religious education of 
the last half century in day schools and Sunday schools has been made in 
England. The Y. M. C. A., desiring to ascertain the attitude of young 
men of the army toward religion, undertook an exhaustive inquiry among 
the chaplains who were with the young men at the front The result of 
this inquiry appears in a book called The Army and Religion, but an ex- 
cellent summary of the evidence is given by Dr. Frederick Lynch in The 
Christian Work, from which we quote. 

Questions were asked of them concerning their attitude toward re- 



84 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ligion, their faith in a Supreme Being, and those things fundamental in 
religion. To these queries the following responses were given: 

"There is a universal belief in God among the young men of Eng- 
land, but it is the product of natural religion. There is little atheism, but 
there is little evidence that the knowledge of God comes from Christian 
teaching." 

What a fearful indictment of Christian teaching. This knowl- 
edge like their conviction of the immortality of the soul, and their 
instinctive turning to God in the hour of danger, is an organic in- 
stinct, and in spite of teachings to the contrary concernig the true 
character of God. They have deeply rooted in their soul instinct a 
belief in the true God. In the Church of England prayer book we have 
these words, "We believe in one living and true God, of infinite good- 
ness, wisdom, and power, without body, parts or passions." In other 
words, an incomprehensible, immaterial being! Thomas Jefferson 
expressed himself in a letter to his distinguished friend, John Adams, 
in this wise, "When we speak of an immaterial existence, we speak 
of nothing; when we say that God, angels, and the human soul are 
immaterial, we say there is no God, no angels, no human soul." I can- 
not reason otherwise. At what age of the Christian church this 
heresy of immaterialism or veiled atheism crept in, I do not know, 
but heresy it truly is. Christ taught none of it. True, he said, "God 
is a spirit!" but he had not yet defined what spirit is, nor hath he said 
that it is immaterial. And the Fathers of the first four centuries be- 
lieved it to be material — fine, and etherial, in very deed, but never- 
theless material. The Prophet Joseph Smith declared that spirit is 
matter, that it is pure and elastic, fine and etherial, but it is matter. 
Hence they found Christianity teaching an incomprehensible, imma- 
terial, impossible God. Their belief in him is not founded upon the 
teaching of the past half century. 

Concerning the equally vital question of belief in the Redeemer of 
the world, Jesus Christ, this is said : 

When it comes to thoughts about Jesus Christ, answers are quite full 
and explicit. There is universal respect for him, though the heroic side 
of his character s'eems largely unknown. There is little knowledge of him 
as the Son of God, the atoning sacrifice, or as the source of living power. 
The men seem seldom to think of him until questioned. He is remote from 
their daily life. Very many letters said his doctrines were womanly and his 
character as presented in church sentimental. The "living Christ" is 
merely a name, and means little to the man. Christ is a historical figure, 
not a present Redeemer. The practical religion of the great mass of men 
seems to be a vague theism entirely disassociated from Christ. 

He has not yet been introduced into their religious teaching ef- 
fectively, and they are coming to realize that serious fact. 

The same question has been discussed by another, and an emi- 
nent one, in these words : 

Present day attitude of the general public toward the churches was 
expressed by Father Bernard Vaughan. "I grieve beyond everything," 
he said, "to have to say how my country-folk in bulk do not accept the 
divine personality of our Lord, that is to say, they do not give whole- 
hearted belief in the Apostles' Creed. And Christ they only know as a 



ELDER HEBER C. IVERSON 



85 



name always to reverence and sometimes to swear by. Do not for a 
moment think that I am making this statement without foundation — on the 
contrary, what is thrust before me more and more every day is that not 
even the language and terminology of Christianity is understood by the 
people. 

"Read the latest book on the subject, The Army and Religion, An In- 
quiry and Its Bearing on the Religious Life of the Nation. It is com- 
piled out of 300 memoranda resting on the evidence of many hundred 
witnesses. 

"When you have put that book down you will find that there is hide- 
ous reason, lamentable reason, for believing that Christ, to 85 per cent of 
our beloved countrymen and countrywomen is today only one name among 
others, like Plato, Sophocles, or Marcus Aurelius. 

"To this growing section of the community Christ is not a living 
force, inspiring their lives and Christianizing their conduct. 

"Must I say it," he continued, "that we are living upon the afterglow 
of Christianity, which before the great religious revolt in the sixteenth 
century was woven not merely into the religious, but into the legislative, 
philosophic, social and dom stic life of 'Merrie England' for 1,000 years? 

"To convert England to Christianity we must start like our Catholic 
missionaries among the heathen — with the children. Alas, parents to whom 
Christianity is nothing and its dogma worse than nothing will refuse to 
have their children respond to. the Divine Master's call, 'Suffer little chil- 
dren to come unto me, and forbid them not.' 

"Somebody will ask me, Is this neopaganism due to the war? Not a 
bit of it. The war has been the occasion of revealing it, that is all. 

"If you want to know what has de-Christianized the country, I point 
my finger to the provided school from which Christ has been turned out 
and the door slammed in his face. , 

"The thought of it makes me bury my face in my hands and sob with 
sorrow and shame." 

Our conception of Christ, his relationship to us as a mediator be- 
tween our Father and his children upon the earth, is to be found in the 
memorable words of Paul the apostle, who, though possessed 
of great wisdom and learning, above that of mostly any other man of 
his time, did not devote his time to the preaching of higher ethics 
or of any other problems, but declared to the Corinthians, "When I 
came to you, I came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, de- 
claring unto you the testimony of God. For I determined not to know 
any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified." Why? 
Because no message the world needed then, nor today, nor in any age 
of the world, equals in importance that sublime, glorious message which 
you and I have had vouchsafed unto us through the revelations of the 
Almighty. 

Paul said, "Though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any 
other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, 
let him be accursed." Christianity has recently been declared by emi- 
nent divines to be a miserable failure in the world. But the gospel of 
Jesus Christ "is the power of God unto salvation" and cannot fail. 

Our idea concerning that great Character whom our Christian 
friends say we do not believe in, is expressed in these sentiments em- 
phasized by Paul, in his Epistle to the Hebrews : 

God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past 
unto the fathers by the prophets, hath in these last days spoken unto us by 



86 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he 
made the worlds; who being the brightness of his glory, and the express 
image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, 
when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the 
Majesty on high; being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by 
inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they. For unto which of 
the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten 
thee? And again, 1 will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son? 
And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world, he saith, 
And let all the angels of God worship him. But unto the Son he saith, 
Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is 
the sceptre of thy kingdom. Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated 
iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of 
gladness above thy fellows. And thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid 
the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of thine hands. 

If there be any doubt as to the identity of this glorious Character 
herein described — let this testimony of John the beloved disciple of 
the Lord set it at rest, wherein he said : 

In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and 
the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things 
were made by him; and without him was not anything made that was 
made. In him was life; and the life was the light of men. And the light 
shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not. There was a 
man sent from God, whose name was John. The same came for a witness, 
to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe. He 
was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light. That was 
the true Light, which lighteth every man that comeh into the world. He 
was in the world and the world was made by him, and the world knew 
him not. He came unto his own, and his own leceived him not. * * * 
And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his 
glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and 
truth. 

What? The helpless babe of Bethlehem's manger, the despised 
carpenter of Nazareth, the sorrowing man of Gethsemane, the cruci- 
fied hero of Golgotha, who prayed heaven's forgiveness for his blood- 
thirsty murderers — he the creator of heaven and earth? Yes, so say 
the scriptures, and so we believe, and so we testify that we know. 

Unto us he has said, "Be ye, therefore, perfect, even as our 
Father in heaven is perfect. Was he an immaterial being? Was he other 
than a glorified, celestialized man? To his disciples, after his res- 
urrection, he appeared, and bade them behold him and the prints of 
the nails in his hands and in his feet, and come and thrust their 
hands into the wound in his side. "Handle me and see, for a spirit 
hath not flesh and bone as ye see me have." 

He occupies a glorious position on the right hand of our Father, and 
has pointed the way and made plain the path, and commanded us to 
walk therein, unto his companionship and glory — "For to him that 
overcometh will I give to inherit all things," said he. 

Paul added, "Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ 
Jesus : Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be 
equal with God * * * and was made in the likeness of men." We, 
too, are made in the image of God, children of God. We believe lit- 
erally in the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man — not as a 



ELDER HEBER C. 1 VERSO N 



87 



mere pulpit platitude, but as an actual reality ; and we know, because he 
has been seen, as the testimony was borne this morning. Great and glo- 
rious is our privilege ! "How firm a foundation, ye Saints of the Lord, 
is laid for your faith in his excellent word !" Men living in this dis- 
pensation have looked into the face and heard the voice of the Redeemer 
of the world. 

This is our testimony to the world, this is the message of the hour, 
the only one that will save the world. "Christianity" — so called, "has 
failed." The gospel of Jesus Christ is the power of God unto salva- 
tion. It is the perfect law of liberty. The Prince of Peace is the one 
who ordained it for the peace of the world; and they may cry, "Peace, 
peace," but it will not come except through the gospel of Jesus Christ, 
the Redeemer of the world, which is being delivered by his servants, 
who bear his Priesthood, is" my testimony to you in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

The chorus sang, "Boys of the Old Brigade." 

ELDER REY L. PRATT 

(President of the Mexican Mission) 

I rejoice very greatly, my brethren and sisters, in having this 
privilege of meeting with you here, and I have listened with great 
appreciation and interest to the testimony of the brethren that have 
spoken this afternoon. Also, I was very greatly interested and edified 
by the remarks of President Grant and President Lund in our session 
in the Tabernacle this morning. 

I am thankful to the Lord for these gatherings ; for the privil- 
ege that we as a people have of coming together and being instructed, 
and listening to the teachings and the testimonies of men whom we 
know are inspired by our Father in heaven. I am thankful to the 
Lord that my lot is cast with the people of this Church; and though 
I have many, many things to be thankful for, and for which I, day by 
day, thank my Heavenly Father, I think there is no thing that I so 
genuinely thank him for as I do for the gospel that has been restored 
in these days in which we live; for the gospel, in very deed, as has 
been referred to this afternoon, and as defined by the Apostle Paul, is 
the power of God unto salvation, unto all who will believe, as, of 
course, those who believe will obey it. 

I am thankful to the Lord for the testimony and the knowledge 
concerning our Father in heaven that came into the world about one 
hundred years ago, when the boy prophet, with a keen desire in his 
heart sought to know which of all the sects of the day was the church 
that Christ recognized. The greatest revelation that has come to the 
world, in all the history of it, was given to Joseph Smith, when be dis- 
covered that our Father in heaven was in very deed a perfect, tangible 
being. The Christian world had gone astray, and believed in the kind 
of God defined in the English prayer book ; and other religious peo- 



88 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



pies worshiped the creations more than the Creator, not knowing who 
God is. But, through that glorious vision, the truth has been borne 
in upon the world that God is, in very deed, our Father in heaven, 
and that we are made in his likeness. 

It is a very strange thing, coming at the time when it did, and a 
very hard question to answer : Why should Joseph Smith, had he been 
a mere reformer not inspired of God, have conceived of the great 
things that he revealed to the world? Why was he not like other 
reformers have been, ever since men have taken it upon themselves to 
reform the religious thoughts and creeds of the world? Why should 
Joseph Smith have been singled out to have announced this all im- 
portant and great truth to the world, if he had not been what we claim 
that he was, inspired of the Lord, arid if he did not receive — as we 
testify that he did receive — this glorious vision of the Father and of 
the Son? I am thankful for these things and for the restoration of 
the Gospel through this mighty prophet that the Lord raised up in 
these the latter days. 

There are a great many things connected with the coming forth of 
the truth and the life and the prophecies given to Joseph Smith, that to 
me are wonderful. I challenge you, brethren and sisters, to imagine 
any young man being able to say what Joseph said that the angel told 
him concerning himself, under similar circumstances, and see it so 
literally fulfilled as it has been in his case. When the angel came, 
in answer to his prayer to, our Father, that he might know his stand- 
ing before him, after some years had intervened after the first vision — 
when the angel came and taught him, that heavenly messenger quoted 
ancient Scripture to him and outlined to him the mission that the Lord 
had called him unto ; he told him about the history that through him 
would be made known unto the world, of the ancient people of this 
land, and he said to him: "Your name shall be known for good and 
for evil among all men everywhere." Now, just keep in. mind the fact 
that he was an obscure boy, away back in a New England town; but 
O, how literally has been fulfilled the word of the angel, as Joseph 
said it was told unto him ! 

At dinner today, I was in conversation with a man who has spent 
four or five years in South America — in Bolivia, in Peru, in Chile, in 
Brazil, and if I mistake not, I think he said he was "over in Argentine. 
He says that away down there, there is no place that you can go that 
the name of Joseph Smith and the fame of the "Mormons" is not 
known. True it is, that in many places it is known for evil, but even 
in that, it fulfils the prophecy of the Lord. It is a fact that we have 
never put forth any very great effort to carry the message of "Mor- 
monism" into South America. One mission was established there, the. 
land was dedicated to the preaching of the gospel, but missionaries 
have never labored in South America. I know of but very few copies 
of the Book of Mormon that have been sent into that land. They 
would have had to be in the Spanish language, to have reached the 
peoples of most of those countries, and I am pretty well conversant 
with all that has been done with regard to the distribution of Spanish

literature for a number of years, and I know that it has not been 
sent there ; but still, this man, who is by the way, not a member of our 
Church, testifies that away back in the Indian towns, away back from 
the centers, away back where the Spanish language is scarcely spoken, 
but where the native languages of those South American Indians is 
spoken, the name of Joseph Smith is known. 

To me, it is a wonderful thing, and I thank the Lord for the 
testimony of the divine mission of Joseph Smith that there is in my 
heart. 

I was particularly struck this morning with the testimony of 
President Grant. He testified that he knew that Joseph Smith was 
a prophet of God, and that the gospel has been restored in these the 
last days. He said, there will be some of you who will say that you 
cannot accept it, that you cannot believe it, but all the disbelief and 
all the ridicule and all the denial of those who cannot believe cannot 
take that testimony out of the hearts of thousands of people — from the 
land of the midnight sun in the Scandinavian countries, to South 
Africa, and from the north of North America to South America, in 
this land, among men and women everywhere upon the face of the 
whole earth (though it is true in sections they are few in number). 
The testimony of the divinity of the mission of Joseph Smith in the 
earth as a prophet of the Lord, is being borne daily throughout the 
world, everywhere ; and I have heard men testify until it seemed that 
their testimony pierced the very center of my soul, here from the 
stand in the Tabernacle ; I have heard them testify in the stakes of 
Zion, I have heard them testify in the wards of the Church ; and I 
have heard them testify in the mission fields, here in the United 
States and in Mexico and all over and up and down the land ; but the 
testimonies of the leaders of the Church do not differ in sincerity or 
in genuineness, from the testimonies of the humble members of the 
Church everywhere. For, as my heart has been touched here by the 
testimonies, those unmistakable, spiritual testimonies that carry con- 
viction to the hearts of men, so has my heart been touched by the 
testimonies of the simple natives of the land where I have been called 
to labor for so many years. 

I recall now having held meetings in their little dwellings, built 
perhaps of corn stalks and thatched over with banana leaves, and in 
the night time, when we have gathered together, after these same peo- 
ple had worked during the tropical heat of the day and nearly worn 
themselves out we have gathered together, and with the light of a 
mere tallow candle, scarcely enough to see to read by, I have seen them 
stand up and I have seen their countenances brightened by the same 
spirit, and heard them bear the same strong testimony that carries con- 
viction to the hearts of men, that I have heard from- our brethren 
here; and I want to bear to you this afternoon, my testimony that I 
know that this is the Lord's work; I know that it shall go on 
triumphant, and shall spread and shall be established in all the earth — 
and ultimately the time will come when all men everywhere will ac- 
knowledge that this is the truth. Just as I expect to see the day come,

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



some time, somewhere, when every knee shall bow to Christ, and 
every tongue confess that he is the Savior of the world, so do I ex- 
pect to see the time come when every tongue will confess this great 
truth, that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God. Men may not confess 
it because they want to. All men that will confess it, perhaps, will 
not repent of their sins; but conditions will be brought about by the 
calamities that the Lord will send upon the world and his punishments 
meted out to men, until men cannot deny, but will confess, even though 
they will not repent, that these things are true. 

It is a wonderful thing to know that this is the truth. We are 
a remarkable people in that respect. I have attended testimony meet- 
ings in many churches — only the other day, when I was stopping off 
a few hours at Trinidad, over in Colorado, I saw a little hall lit up, 
and went in to the service that was held there, and it was a testimony 
service, and I listened attentively. I listened anxiously, and I wanted 
to hear somebody say that they knew that they had the truth, and 
while many testified, none testified that they knew, and never have I 
heard anybody outside of the membership of this Church, stand up 
and say that they know that the gospel that they have embraced is 
the truth and is the power of God unto salvation. 

This Church, brethren and sisters, has been built upon the rock 
of testimony. Joseph Smith, when he came home from this remark- 
able vision, brought down upon himself, by a recital of what he had 
seen, the hatred and the persecution of all the world, it seemed, and 
he was never free from it from that day until he gave his life, sealed 
his testimony with his blood ; and he tells us in this book, The Pearl 
of Great Price, in the Writings of Joseph Smith, that he was given 
to understand that if he would only forsake that testimony or forsake 
that story and say that he had been deceived, he would end all the 
persecution that had been heaped upon him, and that he would be 
received as all other men again ; and that his sorrows should not con- 
tinue in that regard; but, he said. How could I? I knew that I had 
seen a light and I knew that within the light I had seen two person- 
ages, and I knew that I had heard their Voices, and I knew that they 
had spoken to me, and further than that, I knew that God knew that 
I knew those things, and who am I that I might withstand God ? 

My brethren and sisters, his testimony was faithful and true to 
the end of his life ; and the same has been the case in regard to many 
of the members of this Church, some of them in obscure circumstances, 
and some perhaps that will never be heard of, but were in their sphere 
and in their place just as valiant in their testimonies and in their de- 
fense of the truth as was the Prophet Joseph Smith. And that is one 
blessing in this Church, we do not all have to be prophets, in the sense 
that he was, in the Kingdom of God, but we do all have to have faith, 
we do all have to repent, we do all have to live right, and we must, 
each one of us, have the same testimony that he had, or we cannot be 
saved in the Kingdom of our Father in heaven. Heroism is not con- 
fined to those alone who are great in the eyes of men. 

I recall an incident just now that I shall beg your indulgence 



ELDER RAY L. PRATT

to speak of, that happened away down in the land of Mexico, where 
I have been laboring. In the year 1913, conditions became so bad in 
Mexico that upon the advice of President Smith, we decided to leave 
the mission for a time and move out of the country, and with my fam- 
ily and the seven elders that were left with us then, we were making 
preparations to go. I sent word to the branches round about. We 
had been preparing them for it for two years. We had every branch, 
as we thought, that could be organized into a branch, fully organized, 
and we had told the people that perchance we might be called upon 
to leave them for a time, but wanted them to be in a condition to take 
care of themselves ; but just in the afternoon of the day upon which we 
were to leave in the evening, a young man, who only two months be- 
fore had been baptized a member of the Church with his two sisters 
and a little later his mother and his wife and a young friend of the 
family and, I think, one or two more in that particular locality, came 
into the mission house, and there was sorrow in his face, and as he 
clasped my hand, he said : "Brother Pratt, is it true that you are going 
away? Is it true that the missionaries are going to leave us?" I said, 
"Yes,- Brother Monroy, it seems that that is the wisest thing to do." 
And he said: "Well, I have been around and visited the other con- 
ferences and branches some, and I know that they have their branch 
organizations and their conferences and the Priesthood of the Lord, 
and they can get along in some sort of way; but what is going to 
become of us? We have no branch. Who will teach us? Who will 
guide us? Who will carry us forward in this great work?" 

Well, it seemed to me I could not do other than I did. I said, 
"Dear brother, please sit down in that chair ;" and I called the secre- 
tary of the mission into the room and said, "Brother Young, we will 
ordain .this good brother an elder and set him apart to preside over 
the branch in San Marcos, though there are perchance only ten people 
there members of the Church. And we set him apart as branch presi- 
dent, after having ordained him an elder in the Church ; and I said, 
Brother, you go back up there and gather your little branch of peo- 
ple together, and tell them of this. We have not time to go and tell 
them about it. And I gave him a letter. And I said, you take care 
of them as best you can ; put your faith and trust in the Lord and he 
will bless you and magnify you, and you will be an instrument for good 
in that community. 

That night we left, and he took the train back to his home. For 
two years during the troublous times that followed, I received letters 
from him, and they are among the things that I treasure most in life, 
for they are full of faith and they are full of devotion to the Lord, 
and they are full of love toward his fellow men. He went to work 
and gathered his people together and began to hold meetings; and 
from that humble beginning, it was not more than a year until from 
seventy-five to one hundred people were meeting there regularly, 
and in the two years that he presided over that little branch, something 
like sixty people were added to the Church as a direct result of his 
humble and faithful labors.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



But in the events that have swept over Mexico like a scourge, the 
revolution came to his town, and the opposing factions from the north 
and south were contending, with the little town of San Marcos between 
them, the Saints living virtually and literally upon the firing line, and 
day after day the conflict raged, and the Saints one Sunday held their 
meetings while the shells from either side were falling over their meet- 
ing house, but they continued with their services. 

Finally the faction from the north were driven out, and the men 
from the band of Zapata came in, and someone said, "There is a man 
over there who has been assisting the people of the other faction, he 
has been a colonel in the other army. These people from the south 
are infinitely fanatic. I never saw anything like it. They go to war 
with an image of the Virgin Mary tied around their necks ; and every- 
body who will not believe as they do, they think they have a perfect 
right to exterminate. They arrested this dear brother of ours, and they 
asked him if he had a store of arms, and he said no. It seemed to be 
a habit of his from the time he was converted, always to carry in his 
pocket the Bible and the Book of Mormon, and he drew them out and 
said, "These are my arms, and I have carried, and I carry them to 
benefit, not to destroy my fellownnen." And they took him and a 
young man who was in the same house, a member of the Church also, 
to a big tree and put a noose around their necks and strung them up 
until they had fainted, and then let them down and revived both of 
them again and gave them another chance if they would only tell 
where their arms were and say that they would renounce their strange 
religion — for among the accusations brought against him was this, that 
he was teaching a strange religion and strange gods and carrying the 
people of the community after him. 

He said, "I cannot do it, for I know that what I have received 
is true and I cannot renounce my religion." 

His two sisters, on learning what had become of him, went up and 
asked the general to release him, but they were thrown into prison 
with him. Instead of sorrowing, he took his Bible and Book of Mor- 
mon and among the other prisoners tried to teach the gospel. About 
eveningtime the good, old, widowed mother sent a little basket of 
food to the little adobe house where they were confined. And this 
brother, before they prepared the supper, out in that little humble place, 
asked the guards to give him some water. He said he wanted to wash 
himself, his neck was chafed where the rope had been. And he care- 
fully washed himself and combed his hair, and then when they spread 
the food out, he said to those present, "If you have no objections, we 
would like to ask the blessings of the Lord upon this food." In a voice 
that all could hear, he asked the Lord to bless that food, but in a voice 
that only his sisters could hear, he said, "I will not eat tonight, I am 
fasting and praying to the Lord." 

It was not ten minutes before they said they wanted these two men 
outside. The girls stopped eating, of course, and the two men were 
taken out. It was then just dusk, and they were backed up against a 
great ash tree — I can see it just as plainly as if it were here; for I

have seen it and I have heard the mother and the daughters recite 
the sad experience — and six men were lined up to shoot them, and an- 
other said, "Now, as one last chance, we tell you if you will renounce 
your religion and confess before the Virgin Mary, we will forgive you 
and we will spare your lives." 

He said, "Gentlemen, I cannot, for I know that what I have taught 
and what I have accepted is the gospel of Jesus Christ." 

They said, "All right, then prepare yourself, but have you anything 
to say before you are executed?" 

"Yes," he said, "I will make one last request, that I be permitted 
to kneel here and pray." And he knelt there and prayed. He prayed 
first that the Lord would bless his widowed mother and provide for 
her, and bless his wife and little child, who would be left a widow 
and orphan ; then he prayed for the little branch, and he said : "Lord 
bless this little flock that they may not go astray, but that someone 
will be raised up to lead them." And then he turned and said : "Lord, 
forgive these men, for they know not what they do," and as he arose 
from the ground, he folded his arms and said: "Gentlemen, I am at 
your service." 

A moment or two later, the daughters in that little adobe room, 
and the mother a quarter of a mile further on, heard the sound of the 
guns that killed their brother and their son. 

Brethren and sisters, what was it that took that man smiling and 
with faith like that to his execution? It was none other than the 
same testimony that Joseph Smith bore to the world to the very day 
that he sealed his testimony with his blood. And I would rather be in 
their class and give up, if the Lord required it at my hands, my life, 
than to be the owner of all the world and not have that testimony with 
it. 

Brethren and sisters, we are not all privileged to die in that way 
for the work of the Lord, but it is required of each and every one of 
us to live each day in fulfilment of the principles of the gospel and 
to bring our lives into harmony with this great scheme of the gospel, 
for only as we do so, will it be unto us "the power of God unto salva- 
tion." 

The Lord bless you. Amen. 
The Chorus sang, "The Palms." 

ELDER JOHN M. KNIGHT 

(President of the Ensign Stake of Zion and of the Western States Mission) 

There is only a few minutes remaining and I sincerely pray 
for the inspiration of this occasion, and desire the same good spirit 
that has accompanied the remarks of the former speakers, for my 
heart has been touched by their fervent testimonies, and the words of 
exhortation and counsel they have given. 

It was not my good fortune to be in attendance at the morning 
service in the tabernacle, as I did not arrive until the noon hour. I

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



feel that I missed something, for the opening sessions of our con- 
ferences have always been a wonderful inspiration to me. Usually 
the key note of the conference is sounded by the prophet of the Lord, 
the doctrines of the Church are expounded to the understanding of 
the Saints, and where reproof is needed, it is given. 

I have listened with much interest to the remarks of my brethren. 
The conditions they find in their various fields of labor are much 
the same as prevail in the Western States mission. My heart is filled 
with joy when I meet the Saints in the various branches of the 
Church, and also with isolated families far removed from any Church 
organization, and listen to their fervent testimonies, a band of faith- 
ful, self-sacrificing Latter-day Saints into whose lives has come 
a knowledge that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, and that Joseph 
Smith was and is a prophet of the living God, men and women who 
not only welcome the elders, but pray for their coming. 

Elder Pratt's remarks with reference to Trinidad interested me. 
I recently visited our Church members there, for we have a few hon- 
est-hearted people there who have accepted the gospel, and who tread 
unswervingly the pathway of duty, undeterred by doubts, singleminded, 
and straight forward. There is rejoicing in their hearts and a feeling 
of salvation has come into their lives. They, like Job of old, testify, 
"I know that my Redeemer lives." Christ to them is the very Re- 
deemer of the world, and Joseph Smith is his prophet. 

The gospel taught by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints is the power of God unto salvation. Joseph Smith came not 
as did Luther, Calvin, Knox, Wesley and many other re- 
formers, whose lives have influenced so many people in various parts 
of the world, and whose teachings have done so much to break 
the shackles that bound the people throughout the dark ages, but he 
came as a restorer of the gospel of Jesus Christ, and gave unto the 
world the gospel in its fulness. 

The tendency in the world is to humanize religion, eliminating 
all Divinity out of it. One of the so called "Advanced" churches 
of New York City, according to Leslie's Weekly, has resolved to abol- 
ish all reference to "sect, class, nation, or race," and has a new bond 
of union to be signed by all its members. To do this it deems it neces- 
sary to adopt a new "statement of purpose" from which mention of 
Christ and Christianity is omitted. Public announcement is made 
that the "church has dropped Jesus." 

We have people in Denver who follow the teachings of the Marlein 
Bible, written by Rev. Marley, the head of the church, in which men 
are forbidden to mention God or Jesus in their prayers, and to do so 
would be considered heresy and sufficient cause for excommunication 
from the church. Indeed, sample prayers for all occasions and the 
blessing for food are given without a single reference to our Father 
in heaven or his Son Jesus Christ. It may interest you to know 
that their church government is planned after our own, with a 
president and twelve apostles, six of whom are women. Also a high 
council of twelve persons, half of whom are women. The leader con-

fesses be is acquainted with the doctrines and organization of the 
"Mormon" Church. Truly, they have a form of Godliness but deny 
the power thereof. 

How different with our people, the Latter-day Saints, who have 
implicit faith in God and his Son Jesus Christ. They believe that 
be really is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him, 
that through the Holy Ghost they may know him. Paul the apostle 
writing to the Corinthian Saints, (I Cor. 12) declared, "Ye know 
that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as 
ye were led. Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speak- 
ing by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed : and that no man can 
say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost." Latter-day Saints 
receive this witness, and many of them would sacrifice their lives, as 
did the Mexican brother referred to by Elder Pratt, rather than deny 
the truth that had become a part of their lives. The beauty of it all is, 
God is no respecter of persons, and all men everywhere are invited 
to partake freely of these wonderful gifts. In Doc. and Cov. 1 :35 it is 
recorded : 

And again, verily I say unto you, O inhabitants of the earth, I the 
Lord am willing to make these things known unto all flesh, for I am no 
respecter of persons, and will that all men shall know that the day speedily 
cometh; the hour is not yet, but is nigh at hand, when peace shall be taken 
from the earth, and the devil shall have power over his own dominion; and 
also the Lord shall have power over his Saints, and shall reign in their 
midst; and shall come down in judgment upon Idumea, or the world. Search 
these commandments for they are true and faithful, and the prophecies and 
promises which are in them shall all be fulfilled. What I the Lord have 
spoken, I have spoken, and I excuse not myself: and though the heavens 
and the earth pass away, my word shall not pass away, but shall be ful- 
filled, whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants, it is the 
same; for behold, and lo, the Lord is God, and the Spirit beareth record, 
and the record is true, and the truth abideth forever and ever. 

I rejoice in the opportunity that has come into my life to bear 
witness of these things to the people of the earth, it brings peace and 
satisfaction to my soul ; and I pray that so long as I have power to lift 
my voice, it may be in defense of this great Latter-day work, known 
to the world as "Mormonism." It is bound to succeed. It cannot be 
overcome by the powers of darkness. God has so decreed. We meet 
with a great deal of opposition from certain quarters, and I am rather 
glad of it, it not only advertises us, but it puts the missionaries on edge, 
makes them aggressive, and more determined to deliver their message 
to the people. The elders of the Western States mission are crying 
repentance unto the people, and inviting all to come unto Christ. I 
thank God for them, and for their faith and devotion to this great cause. 
I pray that the spirit of peace may abide in your hearts, that God will 
abundantly bless you, with the Holy Spirit that you may have implicit 
faith in this great Latter-day work, and power given you to live its 
principles, I pray in Jesus' name. Amen. 

The chorus sang ."Do What is right." 

Benediction was offered by Elder Joseph S. Barker. 



SECOND [DAY 



Conference continued in the Tabernacle, Monday April 5, at 10 a. m. 
Congregation was called to order by President Heber J. Grant, 
who presided. 

The choir and congregation sang, "We thank Thee, O God, for 
a prophet." 

Elder Peter G. Johnston, member of the general auditing com- 
mittee, offered prayer. 

The choir and congregation sang, "How firm a foundation, ye 
Saints of the Lord." 

ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 

The gospel of Jesus Christ is the power of God unto salvation. 
Salvation so designated means temporal as well as eternal salvation. 

THE GOSPEL COMPREHENDS OUR WHOLE COURSE OF LIVING. 

I believe that within the plan of the gospel are laid down all of the 
laws and principles that underlie our lives, here and hereafter. It 
sets forth a rule of action for our conduct that leads us to happiness 
and joy in this life, as well as to exaltation in the life to come. An in- 
terpretation of the gospel is desirable, in order that men may know 
what is held out to them by it and in it. Its fundamental laws and 
principles comprehend completely our whole course of living. 

HEALTH. 

The gospel lays down the rules that will bring to us one of the 
first essentials, that of health. There is contained within that simple 
and understandable law of the Church, the Word of Wisdom, princi- 
ples, commandments, exhortations which, if lived up to and obeyed, 
insure health. That health is desirable goes without saying. I know 
of no other people who take quite the same view of the human body 
as do we. We regard the body as something more than an organiza- 
tion of the materials of this earth. The body to us has a religious as 
well as a temporal significance. The body is the tabernacle wherein is 
housed our spirit, which is a child of God and which is our greatest 
possession. We cannot desecrate these bodies that have been given 
to us without offering affront to him who gave them. They are sacred 
to us. It is our obligation to preserve them in purity and in whole- 
someness. We are taught that we cannot live proper and righteous 
lives without caring for our bodies in a proper and righteous way. We 
cannot take into our bodies those things forbidden without desecrating 
them, without militating against the efficiency of the body, and with- 
out bringing upon us the effects which follow the infraction of natural 



ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS. 



97 



and just laws concerning health. So that if one would have health, he 
should live the laws of the gospel with reference to health. 

WEALTH. 

The gospel teaches the fundamental laws of wealth — its aquisi- 
tion and proper use. It teaches industry, thrift and economy ; honesty 
in business and unselfishness. It points out that all means and sub- 
stances are gifts from God, committed to the care of men as stewards 
or trustees, to be used for the benefit and advancement of the people of 
the world. It tells us the real meaning of proprietorship. It attaches 
to wealth, as it does to every other material thing, a religious signifi- 
cance and makes plain its proper relation to our lives. 

It bids us return a portion of our interest to the Lord for the im- 
mediate use of his Church and Kingdom, thereby ever reminding and 
impressing us with the true source of our riches. If the gospel con- 
ception of wealth were prevalent in the world there would be no such 
estrangement between rich and poor, between so-called capital and 
labor, as we see today. The perplexing problem of its just distribution 
would be solved and a large portion of the difficulties of human so- 
ciety would be eliminated. 

SOCIAL ORDER. 

The gospel of Jesus Christ lays down also the laws which provide 
for the proper maintenance of our social order. By adherence to its 
principles man learns, in the first place, his relationship to society; 
and, in the second place, to act in such manner as to properly dis- 
charge his obligations to his fellowman. Every problem that con- 
fronts society today has its solution in the application of the simple 
principles of the gospel to human life and living. The gospel points 
out that the foundation of society is the home, and the marital rela- 
tion. We are advised in the gospel what that relationship should be, 
what it should produce, and how it should stand at the basis of all 
social order. So far as I know, there are no other people who sub- 
scribe to the same doctrines in which we believe, concerning the in- 
stitution of marriage, the perpetuity of that relationship, and the re- 
lationship of children to parents. The application of the principles 
of the gospel to this relationship means good homes. Good homes 
mean good communities. Good communities cannot mean anything 
other than a great, good nation, a good country, a good people. 

Not only are we taught that our homes are at the very foundation 
of our social order and relations, but we are taught in the gospel the 
proper relationship of man to man. Charity, kindness, benevolence, 
long-suffering one with another, brotherly help are all principles em- 
braced within the gospel of Jesus Christ and all of them are necessary 
to build and maintain a society that shall be fit for people to live in, 
and to be advanced in. We are given the institutions of the Church, in 
part, at least, to sustain the proper social intercourse among the peo- 
ple. There are provided within the Church agencies and facilities, 



98 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



which meet every requirement of social life. Our wards, to my think- 
ing, constitute the most advantageous social units that have ever been 
devised or suggested in the history of society. There are presented 
within the organizations of the wards opportunities for every person 
to receive legitimate training in society, proper social intercourse and 
the cultivation of all the desirable traits of character that go to make 
up good men and good women. 

GOVERNMENT. 

Not only does the gospel provide the laws, the rules and the 
regulations that govern health, wealth, and society, but the princi- 
ples of the gospel lie at the very foundation of just government. 

The teaching of reverence, of obedience, of respect for law, order 
and authority is indispensable to the maintenance of proper and just 
government. Men who have not been taught to respect authority, 
whether that authority be superimposed upon them, or from whatever 
source it comes, will not respect the authority that they themselves set 
up. I believe firmly that men who believe in God, men who- believe 
in his power to rule, to lay down laws for their guidance and direction, 
are trained by virtue of that belief to be the proper subjects of govern- 
ment. I believe that such training is indispensable to good citizenship. 
Obedience is not only the first law of heaven, but obedience is the 
fundamental requirement of all good government, and until men can 
come to realize that they must yield obedience to the law and the 
authority which has been established, there can never be any proper 
legitimate and adequate government. 

( 

HAPPINESS. 

Not only does the gospel lay down the laws and rules which 
provide for health and wealth for the maintenance of society, for 
government, but it lays down the foundation for that which is indis- 
pensable in human life, real, genuine happiness. There can be no 
true happiness and no true joy, in my judgment, without righteous- 
ness. When I say happiness and joy, I do not miean the superficial 
pleasure that comes to one in the gratification of personal appetite 
and desire. I refer to that inner feeling of satisfaction, contentment, 
love and genuine joy, that come to the man with a clear conscience, 
a life devoid of offense, with love for God and his fellowmen in his 
heart. That supreme happiness and joy, so far as our experience goes, 
can be obtained only in one way. That is by willingly-given service in 
the cause of our Father in Heaven, for the benefit of his children. The 
gospel provides the ways and means in which that service can be 
most efficiently done. The organizations of the Church are estab- 
lished in such manner that service may be rendered by everyone with- 
in its membership to the ultimate benefit of every other member. It 
is a mutual plan whereby each may help every other and the common 
good may be promoted.

UNDERSTANDING THE ALL-COMPREHENDING NATURE OF THE GOSPEL, 

WHAT IS OUR DUTY? 

So that, in brief, the gosel fulfils every requirement of a hu- 
man life. It satisfies every need. It is so comprehensive that it em- 
braces all the good that we desire to be brought into our lives and it 
helps us to work out our salvation here and hereafter. What is our 
duty? Our duty, in my judgment, is to so interpret this great gospel 
of the Lord Jesus Christ that men and women everywhere shall know 
what it means, that they shall know its great significance in the de- 
velopment of their lives and in their salvation. It is our first duty to 
so interpret it for our children and for our people at home that they 
will see it and understand it ; for I cannot but think that if they can 
be brought to realize what it means in their lives, the security that it 
gives them against the incursion of evil and danger, the happiness 
and joy that it insures to them by obedience to its teachings and com- 
mandments, they will not fail to lay hold of it. Our second duty is 
to present it to the world in like manner. I cannot bring myself to 
think that we discharge our full obligation when we merely issue the 
challenge to the world and set forth that here is the everlasting gospel, 
the authority of God, the power to save, without explaining, persuad- 
ing and inviting the men and the women of the world to join in this 
great life-saving plan. I believe it to be our obligation to present these 
great truths in such manner, both to ourselves at home and our fellow 
men in the world, that their real significance shall be felt, that men 
shall be acquainted' with their great need, and that they shall know 
that in no other way than by compliance with the laws, the rules and 
regulations of the gospel can they achieve the great purpose of life 
and be brought back into the presence of God from whom they came. 
Our Church is a great institution. Favorable attention to many of 
our principles has come from various parts of the world. Many 
there are who have come to look upon us as a great people. Let me 
say to you, my brethren and sisters, that we shall not discharge the 
full obligation that our Father has given to us unless we bear out in 
our lives the reputation for good that we enjoy and vitalize in our 
living the eternal principles of truth revealed to us through the Prophet 
Joseph Smith. 

OUR MESSAGE TO THE WORLD. 

Therefore we say to all the world, if you want health, live the 
principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ; if you want wealth, if you 
want that which is necessary to sustain life and to secure the necessary 
comforts of life, obey the laws of the gospel, pay tithing to the Lord. 
If you would solve the great problems of society, apply the gospel 
of Jesus Christ. If you would understand government, if you would 
create and train citizens who will make a great government, live the 
gospel of Jesus Christ, for a good citizen in the Church of God is a 
good citizen in any good government on the face of the earth. If you 



100 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



want happiness, if you want that great joy that comes into the hearts 
of those who know the truth, if you want contentment, peace of mind, 
opportunity for service, live the gospel of Jesus Christ, our Lord and 
Master. 

God help us, my brethren and sisters, to appreciate what this great 
gift, the gospel, means to us. God help us to be worthy of the honor- 
able names we bear: Latter-day Saints in the Church of Christ, I hum- 
bly ask, in his name. Amen. 



ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE 

The meetings of our conference have been notable, as have been 
the meetings of earlier conferences. It is indeed an impressive fact 
that our people come up from the stakes and in from the missions at 
conference time in such large numbers, and assemble to receive in- 
struction, admonition, advice, encouragement and such good gifts as 
the Lord holds in store for them. I have sometimes heard men try 
to describe great gatherings to which people have come for some defin- 
ite purpose, and when all other comparisons seemed to be inadequate, 
they have said the movement was almost like the "Mormons" com- 
ing to conference. No matter what the weather may be, or the sea- 
sonal conditions, a very great number of the Latter-day Saints are 
willing to lay aside their material affairs to gather here in the ap- 
pointed place, at the time selected and announced, for the conferences 
of the Church. In a measure this is comparable to the assembling of the 
tribes in ancient Israel at the time of the Passover, though we come not 
as distinct tribes but as members of one body, all upon one footing, 
everyone representing a unit in the great Church of Jesus Christ. 

THE CHURCH A UNIQUE ORGANIZATION. NOT SECTARIAN. 

In this respect we are unique, and in many other respects is the 
Church unique. How could it be otherwise when the conditions of its 
organization and the occurrences immediately preceding are consid- 
ered ? The Church of Jesus Christ stands, in a particular sense, alone. 
Not even a hostile commentator or an unfavorable critic has ever yet 
ventured to put forth the assertion that this Church has any relation- 
ship of origin and development with any other church or denomina- 
tion on the face of the earth. We are not regarded as an offshoot of 
any mother church. Churches generally treat us for what we are, a 
body of religionists standing alone in the world. 

That does not mean that we shall refuse to lend our ready co- 
operation with other religionists or religious bodies in any movement 
for the general good, in any civic or patriotic duty; but it does mean 
that, so far as the essential characteristics of our organization are con- 
cerned, this Church has no counterpart amongst the sects and de- 
nominations of the day.

TOLERATION DOE'S NOT IMPLY ACCEPTANCE. 

Toleration is a specified characteristic of the gospel of Jesus 
Christ, and we have crystallized that principle into a terse expression 
embodied in our Articles of Faith. We affirm that we do not merely 
beg and ask, but that "We claim the privilege of worshiping Almighty 
God according to the dictates of our own conscience, and allow all men 
the same privilege ; let them worship, how, where, or what they may." 
But while our toleration is thus practically boundless, for we respect 
as sacred the religious convictions of men, we do not carry it to the 
absurd extreme of saying that therefore we are under obligation to 
adopt what others believe. I am willing to tolerate my brother's be- 
lief, because it is his, not necessarily because I think it is true. He is 
welcome to it ; I may have no use for it ; but it is his and he may have 
it. I shall not ridicule it, and I shall not denounce him, provided, of 
course, his belief is not opposed to law and order ; but I should be very 
glad to sit down with him and in a kind, friendly, neighborly and 
brotherly way, try to show him something better, if I know that my 
religion is true and his is not. 

CENTENNIAL OF A GLORIOUS MANIFESTATION. 

Practically a full century ago, in the year of which this is the glor- 
ious centennial, there occurred an epoch-making event in the history 
of the world. Reference was made to this yesterday. I venture to 
call your attention to the actual record. You know the story, I know ; 
but it is well sometimes that we be reminded of what we know. You 
know the testimony of the young man Joseph Smith, to the effect that 
he was greatly wrought up in his mind as to which among the many 
(contending sects of the day was in reality the Church of Christ, for 
he had common sense enough to know that they could not all be right, 
for they were opposed to one another. There was not only opposition 
but hatred among them, and one sect sometimes directed the batteries 
of its assault toward another particular sect, and in the year 1820 there 
was much confusion and much dissension. The young man afterward 
wrote: 

"During this time of great excitement, my mind was called up 
to serious reflection and great uneasiness ; but though my feelings were 
deep and often poignant, still I kept myself aloof from all these parties, 
though I attended their several meetings as often as occasion would 
permit." In his study and thought he turned to the Scriptures and 
was particularly impressed by this wonderful precept and the mar- 
velous promise associated therewith : "If any of you lack wisdom, let 
him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not ; 
and it shall be given him." (James 1:5.) Joseph felt that he lacked 
wisdom. He was in search of it, and he asked of God. He went into 
the woods in the early spring of 1820 to pray; he knelt down and 
poured out the desires of his heart to God. 

THE ETERNAL FATHER AND JESUS CHRIST APPEARED IN BODILY PRES- 
ENCE. 

"I had scarcely done so," he afterward wrote, "when immediately 



102 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



I was seized upon by some power which entirely overcame me, and had 
such an astonishing 1 influence over me as to bind my tongue so that 
I could not speak. Thick darkness gathered around me, and it seemed 
to me for a time as if I were doomed to sudden destruction." But 
though the powers of evil were thus trying to stop his utterance and 
to crush his effort, he called all the more fervently upon his God, and 
he avowed that there appeared a pillar of light, as he says, "Exactly 
over my head, above the brightness of the sun, which descended grad- 
ually until it fell upon me. It no sooner appeared than I found my- 
self delivered from the enemy which held me bound. When the light 
rested upon me I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory 
defy all description, standing above me in the air. One of them spake 
unto me, calling me by name, and said, pointing to the other — This is 
my beloved Son, hear Him!" 

THE CHURCHES OF THE DAY HAD GONE ASTRAY. 

The Celestial Personage thus indicated answered the question the 
youthful seer had specified in his prayer, namely, which of the sects 
or denominations of the day he should join, and, as he averred, "I 
was answered that I must join none of them, for they were all wrong; 
and the Personage who addressed me said that all their creeds were 
an abomination in his sight ; that those professors were all corrupt ; 
that 'they draw near to me with their lips, but their hearts are far 
from me; they teach for doctrines the commandment^ of men, having 
a form of godliness, but they deny the power thereof.' " 

We have been severely criticized because of the declaration that 
the sects and denominations of that day were wrong. Remember, 
please, the declaration was not of Joseph. He had not before known 
that to be the case. Those words were the words of One greater 
than he, greater than you, greater than all of us here assembled, the 
words of the Son of God. Wherein were those churches wrong? Had 
they not much within them that was good? I venture to affirm that 
they had. I doubt not that there were amongst them men of God, 
who were trying to live according to the best light they had received ; 
but as churches they were wrong because they were making false pre- 
tentions. They claimed to possess the power of the holy Priesthood, 
and they essayed to administer the ordinances thereof, all in compli- 
ance with what they understood to be the rule of the form of god- 
liness. We can create many a variation of the form of godliness. We 
can make it intricate and enticing; but no men or body of men can 
gather together or work independently and originate the holy Priest- 
hood upon the earth. To do so would be a greater miracle than for 
one to originate life in dead matter. There is a chasm between in- 
animate and organic matter, between the living and the dead, and man 
cannot bridge it He may take living things, plants and animals, and 
■rear and nurture and tend them, and by selective breeding he may 
produce new varieties, but the man never lived who, with all his 
science, and all his facilities of laboratory and other research, brought 



ELDER JAMES E. T ALU AGE.

into existence one microscopical living cell, except, indirectly, through 
the operation of the laws of life, which are not of man. 

This Church, therefore, from its beginning, has been unique, for 
the organization of the Church was forecasted in this declaration that 
at the time of Joseph Smith's first vision there was no Church of 
Jesus Christ upon the earth ; and I do not see why people should take 
issue with us for making that statement. A man of one political party 
professes to believe that the other political party is wrong; and he has 
a right to believe it, and if he can demonstrate that fact to his own 
satisfaction he has the right to promulgate his belief ; but he should 
do it with regard to the rights of the other party and the members 
thereof. We are not assailing churches ; we are not attacking sects ; 
we have no war with any of the numerous denominations on the face 
of the earth. We are sending out our missionaries, we are using the 
columns of the press, not to attack Catholicism or Protestantism, or 
any form of religion, but to preach in a positive and constructive way 
the principles of . the gospel of Jesus Christ as that gospel has been 
restored to the earth in this dispensation, in strict accordance with the 
predictions of ancient prophets. 

THE CURRENT MOVEMENT FOR CHURCH UNION. 

We are aware that at the present time there is in progress a great 
world movement having for its object the federation of denominations 
and sects professing belief in Christianity. It is known as the Inter- 
Church World Movement. Already we find in the daily press many 
contributions explaining the purpose of the movement. Already the 
advertising pages of the great magazines are being used. Already 
plans have been made for a great assembly to take place, most prob- 
ably though not certainly, in London, appointed for the coming sum- 
mer; and sects and denominations are called together for the purpose 
of forming some kind of a merger or combination. 

It is a very important question to ask : Just where does the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints stand in relation to that matter? 
I answer, it stands aloof and alone. 

Intimations have been given out that this Church is trying to get 
in; that it is trying to curry favor with the sects in order that it may 
have a place in the great combination that has been planned. Why, to 
think such a thing would be sacrilege on our part. We have not de- 
rived our authority to administer in the ordinances of the gospel from 
any of them, nor from any common source. We are no offshoot of 
the Church of Rome. We are no outgrowth of any of the Protestant 
denominations. We constitute a Church that has been organized and 
named by the Lord Jesus Christ. So far as these combinations go we 
wish the participants well. They have been foolishly, as they profess 
and declare, spending vast sums of money for the erection of meet- 
inghouses, chapels, churches that they could not use ; and they say they 
can save money by what they are proposing to do, though they are try- 
ing to raise a great sum by a world-wide drive in order to bring about 
the saving. 



104 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



THIS CHURCH CANNOT BE A PARTY TO IT. 

If they can do anything better for the common good by joining 
together, let them join. Those churches were formed by men, and 
men have the right to do with them as they please ; we shall not in- 
terfere with them. But this Church was not formed on man's initiative, 
it was not called into being because of some brilliant leader who stepped 
forward with a new plan; and therefore we cannot, we have not the 
power nor the authority, to make any kind of affiliation with any 
other church ; and let me -say with equal earnestness, no other de- 
nomination, no church, no sect can ever affiliate as such with this, the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. There have been over- 
tures made by some religious bodies to find out the terms under which 
they probably could come in with us ; and the answer has been : Come 
in as every member of this Church has come in — through the door; 
and note that the door is just wide enough to admit you, one at a 
time, the door of baptism, that ye may receive the Holy Ghost by 
the laying on of hands. , 

Students of human affairs, theologians and other thinking men 
have expressed their amazement at the vitality of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints and they say we have some secret for our 
unprecedented development. Now let me tell you what that secret is. 
I take you all into confidence. But instead of saying to you, don't 
tell anybody else, I invite you to tell the world. This is the secret. 
Every member of this Church stands upon his own feet, upon his own 
testimony, upon his own conviction that this is the Church of Jesus 
Christ. He can not receive that testimony from any other man. No 
president, no apostle, no patriarch, no bishop, no officer in the Church 
has any testimonies to sell, nor any assurances of the divinity of this 
work to give as a personal possession to anybody else. There are 
some riches you cannot share. Now, in a great building such as this 
Tabernacle, one part depends upon the other parts. Knock out one of 
those columns and that part of the gallery would be endangered. Re- 
move several of them and a section of the balcony would collapse. 
But suppose that every part of the building rested upon its own founda- 
tion. Then the destruction of one part would not affect the others. 
Now, that is the secret. Latter-day Saints are individually answerable 
to their God, for individually they receive that great gift of God, the 
testimony of the Lord Jesus Christ. 

I pray that we may be individually true to it. Oh, my brethren, 
my sisters, this is the day of which the prophets have spoken, this is 
the day of trial and of test notwithstanding the many favorable con- 
ditions in which we rejoice. Beware of those who would try to lead 
you away from the foundation of your own testimony. Beware of 
those who would set up factions for themselves, for all such will follow 
the course of those that have gone before and come to grief. Stand 
ye in holy places and be not moved. I ask it for us all, in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH. 105 



A sacred baritone solo, "The Valley of Shadows," was sung by 
John Robinson. 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 

One theme has stood out very prominently, and properly so, in 
the remarks of most of the speakers who have addressed this confer- 
ence. That has been the subject of the great vision given to the Prophet 
Joseph Smith. The previous speaker stated that this is the day of 
which the ancient prophets spoke. With this I fully agree. 

A SCRIPTURE PASSAGE APPLIED TO JOSEPH THE PROPHET. 

There is a passage of scripture recorded in the seventh chapter of 
St. Luke that I shall apply to my remarks this morning. The occasion 
referred to in this scripture was one following the manifestation of 
great power on the part of the Son of God when he raised the 
widow's son from the dead. St. Luke wrote of the event as follows : 

And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God. saying, That a 
great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath visited his people. 

And this rumor of him went forth through all Judea, and throughout all 
the region round about. 

And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things. 

And John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to Jesus, say- 
ing, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another? 

With all sincerity and in humility I shall apply this scripture to the 
Prophet of the nineteenth century and dispensation of the fulness of 
times. There is nothing sacrilegious or improper in this, for I fully 
believe that Joseph Smith was a prophet, and is a prophet of God, who 
received divine approval from the Lord Jesus Christ. And his fame 
has gone forth throughout all the land, and many people have said, "A 
prophet is risen up among us, and God hath visited his people." 

JOSEPH SMITH, THE MESSENGER TO PREPARE THE WAY FOR THE SECOND 

COMING OF CHRIST. 

But the point I wish to make is here : We are living, as all admit, 
in the latter days, when many people are looking for the coming of the 
Savior of the world in the clouds of glory. Of necessity, before that 
day shall come, there must be one sent into the world clothed with 
authority from on high, and commissioned to establish anew in the 
earth the fulness of the everlasting gospel as it was in former days. 
For Christ cannot come to establish the reign of peace until some such 
messenger appear with authority to prepare the way before him. There- 
fore, paraphrasing the nineteenth verse, I will apply it as follows : "Art 
thou, Joseph Smith, he who should come? or look we for another?" 

We read in the third chapter of the prophecy of Malachi, where it is 
written the Lord will send his messenger, and he shall prepare the way 
before him, "and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his 



106 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in." This 
does not refer to the former coming when the Lord was born into this 
world, for we read further, "But who may abide the day of his com- 
ing? and who shall stand when he appeareth? for he is like a refiner's 
fire, and like a fuller's soap." Every indication is that this refers to his 
second coming. 

The Lord, in the former dispensation, sent a messenger to prepare 
the way before him, and in this dispensation it was just as necessary that 
a messenger be sent to prepare the way for the coming of the Lord 
and the establishment of the reign of peace. If Joseph Smith was not 
that man, then we must look for another. Now, I say to you, the issue 
is clear, the line is sharply drawn and there is no occasion for misun- 
derstanding. Either Joseph Smith was a prophet of God, and all that 
he claimed to be, or he was the greatest impostor this world has ever 
seen. There is no middle ground. You cannot say he was deceived, 
that he was mistaken, that he believed that he was called of God and 
thought that he had seen a vision of the Father and the Son but he was 
in error. He was all he claimed to be, or else he was a base deceiver. 
To be consistent, either the one view or the other must be taken, in 
regard to his mission. I repeat, there is no middle ground. Certain 
writers have attempted to explain the mission of Joseph Smith in that 
manner, that he was honestly deceived, but the issue is one that is sharp 
and clear. There is no possibility of his being deceived, and on this 
issue we are ready to make our stand. I maintain that Joseph Smith 
was all that he claimed to be. His statements are too positive and his 
claims too great to admit of deception on his part. No impostor could 
have accomplished so great and wonderful a work. Had he been such, 
he would have been detected and exposed and the plan would have 
failed and come to naught. In the plan of salvation as it was made 
known through Joseph Smith to the world, there are no flaws. Each 
part fits perfectly and makes the whole complete. Attacks have been 
made from the beginning to the present, and yet every one has failed. 
The world has been unable to place a finger upon anything that is 
inconsistent, or out of harmony in the revelations to Joseph Smith, 
with that which has been revealed before, or predicted by the prophets 
and the Lord himself. 

Oh, it is an astonishing thing to me, a remarkable thing, that 
there could be a doubt in the mind of any man who has made a study 
of this situation. I cannot comprehend how he could fail to understand 
the truth,, and be impressed with the fact that Joseph Smith was sent 
into the world to restore that which was lost, the fulness of the everlast- 
ing gospel. Now, I say again, if he is not the man who was to come, 
then we must look for another, for that man must come, if he has not 
come, to prepare the way before the Lord. The time is growing short, 
the signs of the times point to that, and there is much that must be 
done or the words of the prophets shall not be fulfilled. But he was 
the man, and as the Savior, on this occasion to which I have made ref- 
erence, sent those messengers back to John filled with information be- 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH. 



107 



cause of the mighty works which he performed, so the message deliv- 
red by Joseph Smith and his works testify of him to all the world that 
he was called of God. There is no gainsaying it. 

Is it not rather a remarkable thing that in every revelation given 
to Joseph Smith he has been found absolutely in harmony with the 
scriptures? The Lord, as I have stated, declared through one of his 
prophets that before his second coming a messenger should be sent to 
prepare the way and make it straight. You may apply this to John if 
you will, and it is true. John, the messenger who came to prepare the 
way before the Lord in the former dispensation, also came in this dis- 
pensation as a messenger to Joseph Smith, so it applies, if you wish to 
apply it so, to John who came as a messenger to prepare the way before 
the Lord. But I go further and maintain that Joseph Smith was the 
messenger whom the Lord sent to prepare the way before him. He 
came and under direction of holy messengers laid the foundation for 
the kingdom of God and of this marvelous work and a wonder that 
the world might be prepared for the coming of the Lord. 

JOSEPH SMITH FULFILS THE PREDICTION OF THE PROPHETS AND THE 
REQUIREMENTS OF THE FORERUNNER OF CHRIST. 

Speaking of the marvelous work. Is it not rather remarkable also 
that Joseph Smith fulfils the prediction made by Isaiah, as recorded in 
the twenty-ninth chapter of his book, as follows : 

For the Lord hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep, and 
hath closed your eyes: the prophets and your rulers, the seers hath he cov- 
ered. 

And the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book that 
is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this, I pray 
thee: and he saith, I cannot; for it is sealed; 

And the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying, Read this, 
I pray thee: and he saith, I am not learned. 

Wherefore, the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near me 
with their mouth, and with their lips do honor me, but have removed their 
heart far from me, and their fear towards me is taught by the precept of 
men: 

These are almost the exact words spoken by the Savior to Joseph 
Smith : 

Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvelous work among this 
people, even a marvelous work and a wonder: for the wisdom of their wise 
men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid. 

This portrays the condition of the world just one hundred years 
ago when this prophecy was fulfilled. Now, to continue; if Joseph 
Smith did not introduce that marvelous work and wonder, some one else 
must come to do it before the Lord will come. He fulfilled the first 
part of this quotation which refers to words taken from the record of 
the Book of Mormon, as all who have read Church history know. If 
this marvelous work was not established by the Lord, through the in- 
strumentality of Joseph Smith, then some one must come to do it. 1 his 
prophecy, as you discover by reading the whole chapter, was to be 



108 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



fulfilled in the latter times. The world is not looking for any one to 
come to establish that work. ■ No one claims to have done it, other than 
Joseph Smith. He fills the bill. 

Again, the gospel was to be restored as it was in primitive times, 
before the coming of the Lord. All will admit, whether they believe in 
the mission of Joseph Smith or not, that at least there has been a depar- 
ture from the teachings and the organization which existed in the days 
of the Savior's ministry and the ministry of the Apostles. That must 
be, and is, conceded. You cannot find that organization anywhere in 
the world, and you cannot find those doctrines anywhere except as they 
have been given through the agency of Joseph Smith. This gospel was 
to be declared, so John the Revelator has written in the fourteenth 
chapter and sixth verse of Revelation, by an angel who was to fly 
through the midst of heaven having the everlasting gospel to preach 
unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, 
and tongue, and people, calling on them to repent for the hour of judg- 
ment is come. Nobody else, except Joseph Smith, ever claimed that an 
angel did fly and did appear to him with this message, and he was com- 
missioned to send it forth to all the world. 

Joseph Smith declared that he, with Oliver Cowdery, his com- 
panion, received the keys of the gathering of Israel. No one else ever 
claimed to have had them revealed to him. If Joseph Smith did not 
receive them, then some one must be empowered with this authority 
before the coming of the Lord. For Israel is to be gathered, and 
it must be by authority given to some one. Israel is being gathered, 
which indicates that Joseph Smith must have held those keys. Malachi 
has said that the Lord would send Elijah before the coming of the great 
and dreadful day of the Lord. The Prophet Joseph Smith said he 
(Elijah) came to him and Oliver Cowdery with the keys of that power. 
If he did not, and they have told a falsehood, then Elijah must come 
before the great day of the Lord, or the earth will be smitten with a 
curse. No one, save Joseph Smith, has claimed that these keys have 
been revealed. No one else knew what was meant by this passage of 
scripture. The hearts of the children are turned to their fathers, as 
Malachi predicted would be the case, after the coming of Elijah. This 
indicates that Elijah has come and it must have been to Joseph Smith. 

So I might go on with many other predictions in the scriptures. 
You may search from the beginning to the end, all the revelations 
given to Joseph Smith in the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Cov- 
enants, and the Pearl of Great Price, which contain a message to the 
world from the Lord, and you will find that in every instance they are 
in harmony and agree with the revelations of other times. You will 
discover that in all things Joseph Smith fills the bill, he fits into the 
niche which was to be occupied by the messenger who was to come to 
prepare the way before the coming of Jesus Christ. No one else has 
claimed to be that man. Why, then, should we not heed his mission ? 
I say to you, I believe with all my heart, I know it to be true. Two 
themes stand out uppermost always in my mind. That Jesus Christ is

the Son of God, who was crucified for the sins of the world, and that 
Joseph Smith was a prophet called and appointed to usher in the dis- 
pensation of the fulness of times. That is my message to the world, in 
the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER ANTHONY W. IVINS 

My brethren and sisters, I earnestly desire an interest in your 
faith and prayers during the few moments that I stand before you 
this morning, for I feel that I need it. 

ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF THE LAST GOSPEL DISPENSATION. 

All during the proceedings of this conference, as I have 
listened to the remarks of my brethren who have preceded me, 
I have been thinking of the one outstanding incident of interest 
to the Church, which has been so often referred to: that one hun- 
dred years, approximately, have elapsed since the ushering in of this 
the greatest, the most important gospel dispensation that the world 
has ever known. Prophets of old looked forward to it, prayed that 
they might see it, and participate in its activities. The Apostle Paul 
said: "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who 
hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings, * * * having made 
known to us the mystery of his will * * * that in the dispensation 
of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in 
Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth ; even in him." 

There have been other dispensations in which the gospel has been 
brought to earth, all of which have been of great importance to the 
people: that of the meridian of time, when the Redeemer ministered 
in person, being, without doubt, of greater fundamental worth than any 
which came before or will follow after, for the redemption of the 
human family depended upon the atonement which he made, by which 
we are redeemed from the fall and made heirs with hirm to the king- 
dom of his Father. But the great work which he commenced, the 
glorious triumph of right over wrong, of light over darkness, the ful- 
filment of the words of all of the ancient prophets, the consummation 
of the purposes of the Lord, and the redemption of his covenant peo- 
ple, is left for the dispensation in which we live. Proper conclusions 
can only be drawn by comparison. If there were no tall people, there 
would be none short. If there were no short people, there would be 
none tall. If there were no clouds, as there are today, we would not 
appreciate the sunshine ; and if there were no sunshine we 1 would be 
happy, I suppose, with the clouds. 

THE DISPENSATION OF THE MERIDIAN OF TIME, AND THE FULNESS OF 

TIME COMPARED. 

So, as we contemplate the events of the past century, we naturally 
compare our experiences, our accomplishments, our joys and sorrows, 
our successes and failures, with those that others had before us. While 



110 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Christ's ministry did not begin until a considerable time had elapsed 
after his birth, the ushering in of the dispensation of the meridian of 
time may be said to date from that eventful night when shepherds who 
watched their flocks upon the hills of Judea were overshadowed by 
the glory of the Lord, and a multitude of heavenly hosts sang, "Glory 
to God in the highest, on earth peace, good will to men," as the Christ 
was born into the world. 

So, in the day in which we live, while the Church had not yet 
been organized', the ushering in of this gospel dispensation dates from 
the occasion to which Brother Talmage and others have made refer- 
ence, when the Father and Son appeared to Joseph Smith in the early 
spring of 1820. While there was some development in the primitive 
church subsequent to the crucifixion of the Redeemer, before a cen- 
tury had passed, Jerusalem was besieged and taken by the Roman 
armies, under V espasian and his son Titus ; the great temple, in the 
construction of which Herod had employed eighteen thousand men, 
for a period of nine years, was destroyed, the Jews were made captive 
and scattered to the four winds of heaven. To what extent the members 
of the Church who were at Jerusalem at this time suffered, we do not 
know, but we are told that, remembering the admonition of the Re- 
deemer, and taking advantage of the temporary withdrawal of the 
Roman armies, they had been led by Simeon, bishop of Jerusalem, 
to the little mountain town of Pella, where for a time they were safe. 

In the meantime the gospel had been taken by the apostles to 
other nations than the Jews, and at Corinth, Ephesus, Rome, and 
other places, more fruitful fields were found than at Jerusalem. At 
Rome many converts were made to the Christian faith, and as usual, 
with the spread of truth, the powers of darkness arrayed their hosts 
against the Church, and its members suffered persecution, the like 
of which the present dispensation has never known. 

Under Nero, who appears to have been a very fiend incarnate, 
who had murdered his own mother ; who burned Rome that he might 
witness a great conflagration, and then charged the Christians with 
the offense, the /emissaries of Lucifer, the enemy of all that is good, 
and particularly the. enemy of the Redeemer, were given full license to 
wreak vengeance upon these hapless and innocent people, whose doc- 
trines of peace, good will and righteousness, endangered the dominion 
of their master upon the earth. The Christians were accused of being 
rebellious, of holding disorderly meetings, of murdering their own 
children, of being cannibals. If earthquake, famine or pestilence 
came, the Christians were held responsible. It was popular to de- 
nounce and bear false witness against any suspected of affiliation 
with the Church, and when brought before tribunals for trial, if they 
denied that they were Christians, they were condemned because of 
their obstinacy. If they admitted that they were members of the 
Church, they were sent away for execution. Their condition, I am 
reminded, was not unlike that of one suspected of witchcraft among 
the early Puritans of New England. We are told that the suspected per- 
sons were thrown into the water. If they did not sink and drown it 



ELDER ANTHONY W. IVINS. 



Ill 



was evidence of guilt, and they were burned. If they did sink and 
were drowned, it was proof that they were guilty. 

To satisfy his own morbid and savage nature, and please the rab- 
ble, Nero ordered Christians thrown into the great amphitheatre at 
the Coliseum of Rome to be torn by savage dogs, killed and devoured 
by hungry lions, or tossed upon the horns of vicious bulls. He caused 
Christians to be smeared with pitch and tar and burned as torches with 
which to illuminate the city at night. Notwithstanding these atrocities, 
my brethren and sisters, the truth rapidly spread. The maid whis- 
pered it to her mistress. The toiler, as he labored in the field, told 
the wonderful story of the Christ to his fellow workmen, and bore 
witness of its truth. The soldier whispered it to his companion in 
arms. The shepherds, as they tended their flocks, told of those other 
shepherds upon the 'hills of Judea, and thus, each convert doing the 
work of a missionary, very many people were added to the Church. 

. There was at Rome, at the time to which I refer, a great series 
of underground passages or chambers, abandoned quarries from which 
stone, for the construction of the city, had been taken. Had you been 
there at the time to which I refer, and desired Christian worship, you 
would have gone at a late hour of the night, after the city had ceased 
from, its revelry and debauchery, possibly with some friend, more likely 
alone, cautiously toward these abandoned quarries. Silently you would 
have slipped into one of the dark passages, and felt your way forward 
until a glimmer of light appeared in the distance. A man would salute 
you as "Brother," and demand the sign of identification by which he 
might determine your right to be there. You would hear the sound 
of distant voices engaged in singing or prayer, and would soon emerge 
into one of those large underground chambers dimly lighted, and 
find yourself in the presence of a large congregation. All classes of 
people would be represented there. Beneath the outer garment you 
would recognize the uniform of an officer of the royal legions of 
Rome, the rich attire of the patrician, the poorly clad plebeian. Here 
they met as brothers and sisters, uniting their voices in hymns of 
praise and prayer to God for strength to endure the persecution of 
their ignorant and blinded enemies. 

Peter or Paul, if they had chanced to be present, would doubt- 
less have exhorted the assembly devotedly to continue in the 
faith, bearing witness to them that death in the service of the Master 
assured more glorious entrance into his Kingdom. Bread would have 
been broken, blessed, and partaken of; wine blessed and drank, and 
then you would have stolen quietly back to your home, not knowing 
whether, before the setting of tomorrow's sun, you, too, would be 
thrown to the lions. Such was Christian worship during the latter part 
of the first century after Christ. 

THE PRIMITIVE CHURCH AND THE CHURCH OF OUR DAY HAVE HAD 
- ANALOGOUS EXPERIENCES. 

So, by comparison, my brethren and sisters, the experiences of 
the primitive Church and the Church in the dispensation in which we 



112 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



live are analogous. Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist when 
thirty years of age, and was condemned and crucified three years 
later. Joseph Smith was baptized under direction of this same John, 
when twenty-four years old, and was martyred fifteen years later, in 
the thirty-ninth year of his age. Each lived but a short time after his 
ministry began. Both died for the establishment of the same truths. 
Each met death violently at the hands of his enemies, but under en- 
tirely different conditions. Jesus was formally arraigned, tried and 
condemned by a legal tribunal, although not entirely in legal form. 
Joseph Smith was killed by a mob, without pretense of legal form- 
ality. 

Before a century had elapsed after the birth of Christ, all of the 
apostles whom he chose, with the single exception of John, were 
violently put to death by their enemies. During the century which has 
just passed, the Church has experienced' no such conditions as these. 
In both dispensations the Church was unpopular, and its members 
bitterly persecuted ; in our day, thank the Lord, not with the same 
wicked, relentless spirit which was manifest toward the primitive 
Church. 

THE CONDITION OF THE PRIMITIVE CHURCH ON THIS CONTINENT. 

The condition of the Church and its members during the first 
one hundred years after its establishment upon this continent, by the 
Redeemer, was in direct contrast to that of the Church in the old 
world. 

Permit me briefly to read : 

And it came to pass that the thirty and fourth year passed away, and 
also the thirty and fifth, and behold the disciples of Jesus had formed a 
church of Christ in all the lands round about. And as many as did come 
unto them, and did truly repent of their sins, were baptized in the name 
of Jesus; and they did also receive the Holy Ghost. 

And it came to pass in the thirty and sixth year, the people were all 
converted unto the Lord, upon all the face of the land, both Nephites 
and Lamanites, and there were no contentions and disputations among 
them, and every man did deal justly one with another; 

And they had all things common among them, therefore they were 
not rich and poor, bond and free, but they were all made free, and par- 
takers of the heavenly gift. 

And it came to pass that there was no contention among all the 
people, in all the land, but there were mighty miracles wrought among 
the disciples of Jesus. 

And it came to pass that the seventy and first year passed away, and 
also the seventy and second year; yea, and in fine, till the seventy and 
ninth year had passed away; yea, even an hundred years had passed away, 
and the disciples of Jesus, whom he had chosen, had all gone to the 
paradise of God, save it were the three who should tarry; and there were 
other disciples ordained in their stead; and also many of that generation 
which had passed away. 

And it came to pass that there was no contention in the land, because 
of the love of God which did dwell in the hearts of the people. 

And there were no envyings, nor strifes, nor tumults, nor whoredoms, 
rior lyings, nor murders, nor any manner of lasciviousness; and surely 



ELDER ANTHONY W. IVINS. 



113 



there could not be a happier people among all the people who had been 
created by the hand of God. 

OUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS COMPARED WITH THOSE OF THE NEPHITES. 

We have not succeeded, during the past century, in accomplishing 
that which was accomplished by the Nephites, notwithstanding the 
great results which have come from our efforts. The people have 
not yet all been converted to the Lord. We have not reached that 
condition, which I sincerely believe that we must some time reach, 
when we are united in temporal things, as were the Nephites. We 
have not reached a condition where there is no envy, nor strife, nor 
malice, nor whoredoms, nor any manner of lasciviousness among the 
people. We have not reached a condition that we are in one the chil- 
dren of Christ, as the Lord would have us to be. 

It is true, my brethren and sisters, that the conditions under 
which we have labored are entirely different to those which existed 
among the Nephites. The Church was established among them by the 
Redeemer in person, and the power of the Father was manifest in 
his life and works, as he ministered among them, as it never has been, 
and never will be manifested through any other person. In the dis- 
pensation in which we live the Church was established by Christ 
through his chosen agent, and it is true that the signs have followed 
the believer in a remarkable degree, but never with the overwhelm- 
ing, convincing proof which characterized the ministry of the Son of 
God. They were a people of one race, speaking one language, with 
the same ideals, the same traditions, occupying a single country. 

Our efforts have been among the people of many different na- 
tions and countries, people with different languages, with different 
traditions, with different ideals, many of whom, after their conver- 
sion, have left their native lands, all that the ordinary man holds dear, 
and have come to a strange country, to identify themselves with a 
strange people, to be surrounded by a new environment, which was 
entirely contrary to that which they had been accustomed to. 

So I feel, my brethren and sisters, that as we review the events of 
the past century, we have very much to be grateful for, that we may 
justly take pride in what we have, with the help of the Lord, ac- 
complished, because all that has been done has been through the 
Lord and by the help which he has given us. 

WE MAY LOOK, WITH CONFIDENCE AND FAITH, TO THE FUTURE. 

It appears to me that we may look forward with absolute confi- 
dence and faith in the future, knowing, because of the experiences of 
the past, that the Lord is on our side, and that with his help the de- 
velopment of the Church will continue ; that in this dispensation in 
which we live he will consummate his purposes ; his covenant people 
will be gathered; Christ will come to reign personally upon the 
earth ; all of the purposes of the Lord will be consummated, and his 
kingdom be established upon the earth as it is in heaven. May the

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Lord give us faith and strength to continue the effort's of the past 
century, until these glorious purposes shall be accomplished, is my 
earnest prayer, through Jesus Christ. Amen. 

After a number of announcements had been given out, the choir 
and congregation sang, "High on the mountain top." 
Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock p. m. 

Elder Soren Rasmussen, President of the Jordan Stake of Zion, 
pronounced the benediction. 



AFTERNOON SESSION 

The conference was called to order at 2 o'clock by President Heber 
J. Grant, who presided. 

The choir and congregation sang, "Guide us, O thou great Je- 
hovah." 

Prayer was offered by Elder H. H. Blood, President of the 
North Davis stake of Zion. 

Choir and congregation sang, "Redeemer of Israel, our only 
delight." 

ELDER DAVID O. McKAY 

"Even so, I have sent mine everlasting covenant into the world to be a 
light unto the world and to be a standard for my people, and for the Gen- 
tiles to seek to it, and to be a messenger before my face to prepare the way 
before me." 

AN ENSIGN TO THE NATIONS. 

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was scarcely 
one year old when that declaration was made through inspiration 
by the Prophet Joseph. He himself was but twenty-six years of age. 
It is a marvelous declaration, great in its pretension, comprehensive 
in its scope: "Mine everlasting covenant" (the gospel), is sent into 
the world "to be a light unto the world, to be a standard for my 
people and for the Gentiles to seek to it." 

On Bedloe Island, at the entrance of New York harbor, there 
stands the Statue of Liberty, a light to the nations. What it has meant 
to thousands and hundreds of thousands of the down-trodden of Eu- 
rope has been most graphically expressed by Israel Zangwill in that 
impressive production, The Melting Pot. I shall read a few words. 
David the emigrant, the little Russian Jew, is speaking: 

All my life America was waiting, beckoning, shining, the place where 
God would wipe away tears from off all faces. To think that the same 
great torch of Liberty which threw its light across all the seas and lands 
into my little garret in Russia is shining also for all those other weeping 
millions of Europe, shining wherever men hunger and are oppressed, shin- 
ing over the starving villages of Italy and Ireland, over the swarming, 
starving cities of Poland and Galicia, over the ruined farms of Romania, 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY. 



115 



over the Shambles of Russia. When I look at our Statue of Liberty, I 
just seem to hear the voice of America crying: "come unto me all ye 
who are weary and heavy-laden, and I will give you rest, rest." 

What inat Statue of Liberty symbolizes to the oppressed and 
down-trodden of Europe, the gospel of Jesus Christ is to the world. 
"Mormonism," so-called, has reared an ensign to the nations and, with 
words as comprehensive as those I have read in the revelation, invites 
the 1 world to peace, to rest, to contentment. 

TO WHOM DOES THE ENSIGN NOW WAVE? 

High on the mountain top 

A banner is unfurled; 
Ye nations, now look up; 

It waves to all the world; 
In Deseret's sweet, peaceful land — 
On Zion's mount behold it stand! 

Then hail to Deseret! 

A refuge for the good, 
And safety for the great, 

If they but understood 
That God with plagues will shake the world 
Till all its thrones shall down be hurled. 

And to whom does that Ensign now wave? To what sort of 
world does the beacon-light of the everlasting gospel extend its 
invitation? A mew world, or rather a world struggling to make itself 
new. The terrible war that has just passed was but the birth-pangs — 
and now the world is ready to be reborn. "We stand at a creative 
moment in human history," says Sherwood Eddy. "Never before has 
the whole world had the chance to make all things new, old customs 
and contentions, old rules and ruts, old traditions and enslavements 
have been broken forever. We are living in the birth-pangs of a 
world struggling to be reborn, and the issues of our time will reach 
into eternity." 

I believe that mankind today is earnestly seeking after the truth. 
I believe, notwithstanding some of the terrible conditions that pre- 
vail across the sea, and even here in our own United States, that the 
efforts men are putting forth are but the results of yearning souls 
desiring to know the truth. The truth is the child that is to be born, 
and I believe that most of these men are honest in their desires to 
claim it as their own. 

MANY HONEST SEEKING FOR TRUTH BUT CANNOT FIND IT. 

Leading thinkers and statesmen are calling upon mankind every- 
where to get back to the religious ideals, and yet when men come back 
to the churches they find that when they ask for bread they are given 
only a stone. Doctor Joseph Post Newton makes this startling dec- 
laration, regarding the ineffectiveness of the churches to reach these 
struggling souls: "Twenty per cent of. the pastors, who were with 
us before the war, have resigned to enter other occupations. Of the 
one hundred and ten million people in the United States, not more 



116 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



than forty-four million attend services in any religious denomination." 
And the editor of the World Outlook thinks this: "A very liberal 
estimate. There are today," continues Dr. Newton, "three million 
fewer children attending Sunday school in the United States than be- 
fore the war." And then the editor of the paper quoted makes this 
significant remark : 

If anything is evident it is that Protestantism is going to pieces faster 
than the tale can be told or the figures be compiled. The great majority 
of people, and of intelligent people, have lost all confidence in existing 
churches and have washed their hands of them for good. If religion is to 
be saved a revolution in thought and methods and organization must 
take place, no less complete than that of the Protestant reformation. The 
times are ripe for a second Martin Luther to do to Protestantism today 
what the first Luther did to Catholicism yesterday. 

WHERE THE TRUTH MAY BE FOUND. 

On the face of that condition, we have this declaration, made 
ninety years ago, that "the Everlasting Covenant, the gospel, is to be 
a light to the world and is to be a standard for my people and for 
the Gentiles to seek to it." If this is truly the light for which the 
world is seeking, it is well to realize that never before has there 
been such a responsibility upon you men, upon you women, who as- 
sume to declare that already in the world is the truth for which the 
world is struggling. What you claim must be substantiated by facts. 
The tree must be judged by its fruit, and mankind today are ready to 
test the fruit and act accordingly. The responsibility of showing to 
the world that the gospel of Jesus Christ will solve its problems rests 
upon the men who make the claim, who believe that the declaration 
made by the Prophet Joseph is true. We heard this morning from my 
brother, Stephen L. Richards, that the Church is so constituted that 
every human need may be supplied. I believe in his statement. I 
believe, too, that every world problem may be solved by obedience to 
the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ. 

AN EMINENT STATESMAN'S SUGGESTION. 

An eminent statesman of our own nation, one who has won na- 
tional and international eminence, not only as a great leader in the 
political world, but as a speaker and writer on religious topics, gave 
to the world, in February, some of his views regarding the solution 
of the difficulties which the churches now meet in answering the 
needs of humanity. That eminent statesman is here today. I in- 
tended to quote him. I am sure that I should not hesitate now to say 
in his presence what I was going to say in his absence. In an excellent 
article entitled : "In the World, of the World, and for the World," 
Col. William Jennings Bryan, in the World-Outlook, of February, in 
giving suggestions on how the churches can make the world a better 
place to live in, proposes first a change of attitude toward amuse- 
ments. He writes : 

The tendency has been to prohibit amusements which are hurtful 
rather than to encourage those which are healthful and wholesome. Amuse- 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY. 117 

ments are necessary; and if those which uplift are not introduced, harm- 
ful pastime will be resorted to. This explains why so many young 
people are drawn away from the Church just at the age when they ought 
to be drawn into it — they are influenced by the worldly minded with whom 
they find amusement during their leisure hours. * * * My suggestion, 
therefore, is that an effort should be made to set up a Christian standard 
for Christian communities and to create an environment that will be help- 
ful to the Church and the spiritual things for which the Church stands. 

HELPFUL ENVIRONMENT IN THE CHURCH OF CHRIST. 

The "Mormon" Church has always encouraged legitimate amuse- 
ments; in this respect, at least, it has set a worthy example to the 
world. That "helpful environment" mentioned by Mr. Bryan has 
been in the Church of Jesus Christ ever since its organization. Away 
back in the days of Nauvoo we find the drama introduced by the 
Prophet Joseph. We find acting in that drama men who later be- 
came prominent leaders in the Church. Among them was the man 
who succeeded the Prophet Joseph, Brigham Young. He, imbued 
with the necessity of influencing the people in their amusements and 
of using their recreation as a means of instilling virtue, integrity, and 
honesty, brought to these valleys that spirit. Why, even on the plains, 
after a day's march, the wagons were drawn up in a circle, a man with 
the violin would take his place by the campfire and there on the 
prairie the sturdy Pioneers would join hands in a dance, opening it 
by prayer, and participate in amusement that fostered the spirit of 
the gospel. Two years had not passed after their entrance into the 
"Valley" before they built the "bowery," and there presented, un- 
doubtedly, the first drama that was ever given in the West. Later they 
built the Social Hall. Perhaps, there are those in the audience today 
who, after listening to the opening prayer, joined hands in the cotil- 
lion, dancing in a spirit best understood by the remarks of President 
Brigham Young, who once said, in substance : "The atmosphere of 
the dance should be such that if any elder be called from the party to 
go to administer to a sick person, he could leave with the same spirit 
that he would go from his elders' quorum meeting." All over this 
land, today, in the excellent community centers established by those 
early pioneers, you will find the amusements characteristic of the 
spirit of the community, fathers, mothers, boys and girls, mingling 
together in the dance, in the drama, and in other social functions, the 
modifying and uplifting influence of the Church permeating all gath- 
erings. And here, I add that the Latter-day Saints Church was the 
first Church in the world, I am informed, to give approval to the Boy 
Scout movement. So, the world, in order to get into their churches the 
spirit of proper amusements which our eminent visitor suggests, and 
which I accept with all my heart, need only to accept the ideals of 
the Latter-day Saints. 

ANOTHER EXAMPLE— HELPING THE POOR. 

To quote further from Mr. Bryan: 

Another matter which, to my mind, needs attention is provision for the 
needy of the Church. Is there any reason why a member of the church 



118 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



should be compelled to pay cut-throat pawnshop rates, for short loans, 
or loans made on chattel-mortgage security? It seems to me that there 
is imperative need for a church corporation financed by church members 
which will make loans to other members at a rate sufficient only to cover 
actual risk, and the risk ought to be very small in such cases. 

We have in the Church of Christ a condition which has been 
operated ever since its organization, which will supply the needs of 
every worthy person who happens to be financially unfortunate. It 
is a simple little thing, but in its power, in its comprehensive benefit 
it smacks of the divinity with which this Church is impregnated. I 
refer to the Fast offering that every Latter-day Saint is asked to 
contribute on the first Sunday of each month. It is suggested that 
all shall fast once a month. The requirement of the Church is that 
all members shall observe the first Sunday of every month as Fast 
day. Back of that, however, is this, that after abstaining from eat- 
ing, from the evening meal on Saturday to the evening meal on Sun- 
day, the value of those two meals shall be given to the bishop for 
the purpose of alleviating the needs of those who require substantial 
assistance. Now, at first thought, that does not amount to much, and 
yet I find that when the principle is applied to the largest stake in the 
Church, this is the result: That stake last year found it necessary 
to expend $6,256.09 for the relief of the poor. If the members of that 
stake had placed a value upon each meal only at 10c per capita the 
bishops would have had at their disposal, $21,190, sufficient to meet 
not only all the demands of their own stake, but the needs of the poor 
in other stakes in which the fast offerings might have been insuf- 
ficient. It applies to the smallest stake just the same. In the small- 
est stake in the Church, with a population of 1,070, they expended, 
last year approximately, only $100 for the need of the poor. It is a 
rural community in which there are practically no poor. Had they 
placed upon each meal the value I have named, the bishops in that 
stake would have had at their command fifteen times more than the 
actual amount needed to supply their needs. Such application may 
be multiplied by eighty, the number of stakes in the Church. You 
may multiply it by eight hundred or more, the number of wards 
in the Church and you may extend the plan over all the world and 
the application of that simple principle will supply the wants of every 
needy person. It is God's way. You say people don't like charity? Why, 
it should not be administered as charity; but as a co-operative plan 
of mutual service adopted for the benefit of all. 

So we might go on with other propositions on applied Christi- 
anity named in the article from which I have quoted, and we should 
find that the solution of the great world problems is here in the 
Church of Christ. Ample provision is made not only for the needs 
of individuals, but for the nation and groups of nations. 

"MORMONISM" THE APPLICATION OF GOd's PLAN TO SOLVE WORLD 

PROBLEMS. 

I realize that it is a great claim. I grant you that we may seem 
to be arrogating to ourselves superior wisdom, but we are not. It is 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY.

simply the application of God's plan to the world problems. I said 
you who hold the Priesthood have greater responsibility today, now 
that you live in this creative moment in the world's history, than ever 
the Church has had before. I repeat it. If we make the claim to 
hold the truth it is obligatory upon every Latter-day Saint so to live, 
that when the world comes, in answer to the call, to test the fruit of 
the tree, it will find it wholesome and good. 

O may we be able to say truthfully, to the world, in the words 
of Thomas Nixon Carver: 

Come, our way of life is best, because it works best. Our people are 
efficient, prosperous and happy because they help one another in the pro- 
ductive life. We waste none of our substance in vice, luxury or ostenta- 
tion. We do not dissipate our energy in brawling, gambling, or unwhole- 
some habits. We conserve our resources of body and mind and devote 
them to the upbuilding of the kingdom of God, which is not a mystical 
but a real kingdom. It is a body of people dominated by ideals of pro- 
ductivity, which is mutual service. We do not strive for the things which 
satisfy but for the moment and then leave a bad taste, we strive for the 
things which build us up, and enable us and our children to flourish and 
to conquer. We strive to make ourselves worthy to receive the world by 
fitting ourselves to use the world more productively than others. We be- 
lieve that obedience to God means obedience to the laws of nature which 
are but the manifestations of his will and we try by painstaking study to 
acquire the most complete and exact knowledge of that will in order 
that we may conform ourselves to it. * * * We offer you hard work, 
frugal fare, severe discipline, but a share in the conquest of the world 
for the religion of the productive life. 

The Lord help us to be able to prove to the world that we possess 
just what these great thinkers desire, just what the world today is 
longing for, and when they see it, may they know, as you know, as 
I know, that the everlasting gospel is a light to the world. May it 
ever be upon the hill a light to the nations, a savior to them, and solu- 
tion of all the world problems, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen.

THE TRUE AND LIVING GOD. 

Joseph Smith's first great service to humanity was in bringing 
back the lost knowledge of the true and living God. What do we 
mean by that ? Who and what is the true and living God ? He is the 
God of the Bible, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the God of 
Adam, of Enoch, of Noah, of the Patriarchs and Prophets and Apos- 
tles of old. He is the God described by Moses in the first chapter of 
Genesis, thus : "God created man in his own image, in the image of 
God created he him, male and female created he them." This is equiv- 
alent to saying that God is in the form of man, and that we have a 
Mother as well as a Father in heaven, in whose image or likeness we 
are, male and female.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ANCIENT IDOLS. 

The world had need of this instruction, for they were worshiping 
all sorts of deities at that time. They had forgotten the God of their 
fathers, the God of Adam and of Abraham, and were bowing down to 
idols. In the days of Moses, fifteen centuries before Christ, there were 
three great centers of religious thought and philosophy. One was 
among the Phoenicians or Canaanites. They worshiped the sun and 
the moon, ascribing to them the powers of creation — worshiped them 
with licentious rites suggestive of creation. This was the worship 
of Baal and Ashtoreth, against which the children of Israel were espe- 
cially warned. Down in Egypt they adored beasts and reptiles, such as 
the crocodile, the bull, the goat, and the beetle. The gods were 
supposed to be enshrined in such bodies, and if a goat died, it was 
buried with costliest ceremonies, amidst the mourning of a nation. 
Away off among the Hindus the seasons were deified — spring, sum- 
mer, autumn, winter. These were thought to be the divine sources 
of life. The passions of the human heart — love, hate, fear, anger, 
revenge, and so forth — were also revered as deities. Then came 
Moses, a man who had seen the true and living God, had conversed 
with him face to face, and had received from him the Decalogue or 
Ten Commandments unto Israel. The first of those commandments 
reads : "Thou shalt have no other gods before me." Is it any wonder 
that this commandment was given, and given first, under such condi- 
tions ? 

THE FATHER'S "EXPRESS IMAGE." 

The world of Joseph Smith's time did not worship the sun and 
moon, nor the beasts, nor the seasons, nor the passions. Never- 
theless, they had turned away from the true God ; they ignored or mis- 
interpreted what Moses had taught, that man is in the image of God, 
and therefore, inferentially, logically, that God is in the image of man. 
Jesus Christ, the Son of God, whom the Scriptures declare to be "the 
express image" of his Father's person, came down from heaven and 
walked as a man upon the earth, plainly showing what kind of a being 
God is. Moreover, wtfen Philip, his disciple, said to him : "Lord, 
show us the Father," Jesus replied : "He that hath seen me hath seen 
the Father." But this teaching was lost upon the modern Christian 
world. 

THE CHRISTIAN DEITY. 

What kind of a God was Christendom worshiping when Joseph 
Smith and "Mormonism" came forth? Let Christian theology tell. 
Therein it was written, and it stands to this day, that God is a being 
without body, parts, or passions. The Church of England Articles of 
Religion so declare. The Presbyterian Confession of Faith so af- 
firms. And this was the popular concept of Deity throughout the 
Christian world at the opening of the Nineteenth Century. In line 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY. 



121 



with that tenet and teaching, the English poet Pope, who figured in 
the Eighteenth Century, represents God as a spirit or "soul" that 

Warms in the sun, refreshes in the breeze, 
Glows in the stars and blossoms in the trees, 
Lives through all life, extends through all extent, 
Spreads undivided, operates unspent. 

A very admirable description of what might be termed a spiritual 
emanation from God, that universally diffused essence that proceeds 
forth from the Divine Presence, and is the power that enlightens 
in greater or less degree every man that cometh into the world. It 
is indeed the light of the sun, moon and stars ; the light also of the 
human understanding ; in it we live, move, and have our being, for it is 
the principle of life throughout creation. But that is not the God 
who made man in his own image. That is not the Father, represented 
by the Son, in whom "dwelt the fulness of the Godhead bodily." It 
is not even the personage of the Holy Ghost. 

DIVINITY AND ITS EMANATION. 

There are Three that bear rule in the heavens, the Father, the 
Son, and the Holy Ghost, three distinct personalities, but the Father 
and the Son, according to Joseph Smith, are personages of tabernacle, 
having bodies "as tangible as man's," while the Holy Ghost "is a 
personage of spirit." From this Eternal Godhead proceeds a spiritual 
power or essence, omnipresent and immanent in all things; and this 
is what the poet was describing when he portrayed God as a "soul" 
that "warms in the sun, refreshes in the breeze, glows in the stars and 
blossoms in the trees," etc. This is what the Christian sects were 
worshiping — not Divinity, but an emanation from Divinity. They 
had turned from the truth "unto fables," as did the ancients; and it 
devolved upon Joseph Smith to shatter the false doctrine of a bodiless, 
passionless Deity, and bring back the precious knowledge that had 
been lost. 

Joseph's vision. 

We are all familiar with the story — how a boy of fourteen 
years went into the forest and prayed; how he wrestled with Satan, 
and was delivered ; how he saw a light above his head brighter than 
the noonday sun, and in the midst of it two glorious beings in the 
form of man, One of whom, pointing to the Other, said : This is my 
beloved Son, hear him." From that hour, there was one person, at 
least, upon this planet who knew what kind of a being God is. It was 
a virtual reassertion of the first commandment in the Decalogue, v 
"Thou shalt have no other gods before me." 

WHAT CONSTITUTES IDOLATRY? 

To worship anything that God has made, is to practice idolatry. 
It matters not What it is. If we turn from the Creator to the crea- 
ture ; if we forget the Giver and adore the gift ; if we forsake God and 



122 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



worship an emanation from God, we are idolaters, just as much as if 
we worshiped the sun and moon, or bowed down to goats and croco- 
diles. The man who loves money and makes it his main object — 
makes it an end instead of a means — is an idol-worshiper. Wealth 
is a blessing from God, and so is the gift to acquire it; and if men, 
when they become rich, use their ridies in the way God designed, he 
approves of them and blesses them more abundantly. But the man 
who adores his possessions, and forgets that they were given for a 
good, a wise, an unselfish and an altruistic purpose, is an idolater, akin 
to those ancient peoples, who in their spiritual blindness worshiped 
things that God had made and given, instead of the Maker and 
Giver. 

THE FINAL DISPENSATION. 

Joseph Smith's next great service to the race was in opening 
this gospel dispensation — the Dispensation of the Fulness of Times. 
What does that mean ? To dispense is to distribute or deal out in por- 
tions, as when the sacrament of the Lord's Supper is dispensed to a 
religious congregation. In a larger sense, it signifies the opening 
of the heavens and the sending forth of the gospel and the powers 
of the Priesthood, as a boon and blessing to mankind. The term- "dis- 
pensation" also defines the period during which these saving and ex- 
alting principles, thus sent forth, continue operative in pristine power 
and purity. There have been many dispensations of the gospel, though 
men know little concerning them. The gospel of Christ is more than 
"the power of God unto salvation ;" it is the power of God unto ex- 
altation, and was instituted as such before this earth rolled into exist- 
ence, before Adam fell, and consequently before man had need of 
redemption and salvation. It is the way of eternal progress, the path 
to perfection, and has been upon earth in a series of dispensations 
reaching like a mighty chain from the days of Adam down to the 
present time. The great difference between this dispensation and all 
others is, that this is the last and the greatest, virtually all dispensa- 
tions rolled into one. God has decreed to bring together all things 
that are Christ's, both on earth and in heaven, and the first part of 
the divine program is the gathering of scattered Israel and the building 
up of Zion, preparatory to the coming of the King of kings, the ush- 
ering in of the Millennial Reign, the sanctifying of the "earth, and 
its eventual glorification, when it will be converted into a celestial 
sphere, an abode of the righteous forever. 

NOT AN ACCIDENT. 

It was no accident, no chance happening — Joseph Smith's going 
into the grove that spring morning, one hundred years ago. It was 
an event predestined, heaven-inspired. I once thought that any 
good boy who prayed in faith could see just what Joseph saw. But 
I have put away that childish notion. I have learned that all boys 
are not Joseph Smiths. God hears and answers the prayers of the 
humblest of his children ; but he answers them as seemeth him best, 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY. 



123 



and not always in the same way. He gives according to the capacity 
of the one who receives. 

PROPHET AND SEER. 

• 

It was no ordinary man that went into the woods that morning to 
pray. It was a Prophet, a Seer. Joseph Smith was not made a prophet 
by the people who held up their hands for him on the sixth of April, 
1830, when this Church was organized. He was already a prophet, 
chosen, as Abraham had been, before he was born ; ordained, like Jere- 
miah, before he was formed in the flesh. The people merely "sus- 
tained" him in that position, manifesting by the uplifted hand that 
they were willing to follow him as their leader, and' to accept of his 
ministrations in that capacity. He was already a prophet, already a 
seer; God had made him such in advance. But all men are not 
Joseph Smiths. He was a man like unto Moses. He was the rarest 
human being that has walked this earth in the past two thousand 
years. And why did he go into the grove that morning and pray for 
wisdom and light? It was because the time had come. The Hour 
had struck, and The Man was there — the man whom God had provided. 

THE WORLD'S SATURDAY NIGHT. 

We are living in the Saturday night of the world's history. Earth 
has labored six days, and will rest upon the seventh, her period of sanc- 
tification. This is the significance of "Mormonism," of Joseph Smith, 
and of the work that he inaugurated — the lifting of the Ensign for 
Israel's gathering upon this the land of Joseph, the land of Zion, to 
build the New Jerusalem, and prepare the way for the coming of the 
Lord in his glory. Earth has labored six days but they are not days 
of twenty-four hours each. Joseph taught that there is a great planet 
named Kolob, nearest the Celestial Throne, and that it revolves once in 
a thousand years. That is a day with God. It was such a day that 
Adam was warned of when told: "The day that thou eatest thereof, 
thou shalt surely die; for Adam, after eating of the forbidden fruit, 
lived to the age of nine hundred and thirty years. It was such a day 
that Peter had in mind when he wrote: "A day with the Lord is as 
a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day." According to 
our Prophet's teachings, God gave to this planet, Mother Earth, seven 
thousand years as the period of "its temporal existence;" and four 
thousand years, or four of those great days, had passed before Christ 
was crucified, while nearly two thousand years, or two more days, 
have gone by since. Consequently, we stand at the present moment in 
the Saturday Evening of Time, near the close of the sixth day, at the 
week's end of human history. Morning will break upon the Millen- 
nium, the thousand years of peace, the Sabbath of the World. 

HOUSE-CLEANING IN PROGRESS. 

Marvel not, therefore, that all things are in commotion. War, 
famine, pestilence, earthquake, tempest and tidal wave — these are 
among the predicted signs of the Savior's second coming. Earth must 



124 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



be freed from oppression and cleansed from all iniquity. It is God's 
House, and he is coming to live in it, and to make of it a glorified 
mansion. House-cleaning is in progress, and Saturday's work must be 
done and out of the way before the Lord of the Sabbath appears. 

The choir and congregation sang the hymn, "Do what is right, 
let the consequence follow." 

ELDER CHARLES W. NIBLEY 

(Presiding Bishop of the Church) 

I need not tell you, my brethren and sisters, that this is something 
of a surprise to me to be called on this afternoon. However, I learned 
in the early days of my experience in this Church that obedience is 
the first law of the gospel and I know that we should always try to 
comply with the requirements of our brethren who preside over us. 

A WONDERFUL ATTENDANCE OF MEN. 

It has been a great pleasure to me to sit in this conference during 
its different sessions and listen to the remarks that have been made by 
the brethren, and to see this great audience day after day. Yester- 
day the building was even more crowded than it is today, yet so far 
as I can see every seat is taken. This 16 an inspiration of itself. I 
don't know where you will go anywhere in the world to find a re- 
ligious congregation such as this. In most religious gatherings we 
find the women predominating, but here I see extending clean back 
two-thirds of the way a great body of men, sturdy, strong, hard-fisted, 
hard-working, intelligent, well clad, good men. And also a large 
number of the most splendid women in all the world. It is marvelous. 
It is an evidence that you are in earnest, that you believe what we 
have heard, and that which we do hear is ih very deed the gospel of 
Jesus Christ. 

THE CENTENNIAL OF A GREAT EVENT. / 

We have heard over and over again the story of the boy prophet, 
which has been the general theme of this conference, since it is the 
centennial of that event: that great event which occurred, as Elder 
Whitney has just told us, because the great clock of time had struck 
the hour when the gospel was to be restored. The prophet was there, 
the fore-ordained prophet ; the place was prepared, everything was in 
readiness for the greatest spiritual manifestation that the world has 
seen ; the greatest event indeed that has transpired in the world since 
the days of the Savior of mankind, that is, since he lived in the flesh. 
Of course, other manifestations followed in due time, giving instruc- 
tion, line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a 
little, until there grew under the guidance of the young prophet this 



BISHOP CHARLES W. NIBLEY. 



125 



most wonderful organization named by the Lord, the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 

WHAT ARE THE FRUITS OF "MORMONISM ?" 

Now, one of the two things we can say must 'be true. That vision, 
that manifestation, the beginning of this great work, the very in- 
ception of it, the first word that we ever heard of it is right there. Now 
that word was true or it was false. It must be one or the other. We 
accept that fully and finally. Was it true ? How shall we measure it ? 
How shall we prove it? The Savior of the world said a tree is known 
by its fruit. Men do not gather grapes of thorns, nor figs of thistles. 
We know that doctrine to be true. Now what are the fruits that this 
tree called "Mormonism" has produced? In the ninety years that 
have passed since the Church was organized or in the one hundred 
years since that great spiritual manifestation, what are the fruits of 
this tree? Well, let me call your attention to two or three little items 
that are more material than spiritual. The Savior himself stated to 
those who could not believe his doctrine that they might at least 
believe the works, for they were patent, they were self-evident. Any 
person might believe them because there they were. So we say, if you 
cannot believe our doctrine you must believe the works for there they 
are manifest. Now was it a good work? Has it been a good work 
to preach the gospel to the poor of the world ? For we can say with one 
of the apostles of old, "Not many wise men after the flesh, not many 
mighty, not many noble, are called." No, they turn from it, the sac- 
rifice is too much for them. But not so with all of the poor of the 
world. Some have believed. They have answered the call. The 
Savior's call was, "Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy 
laden, and I will give you rest." There never was rest for the body, 
but rather hard work, labor, industry. Now has that been a good 
work to gather these people from every nation under the sun and 
bring them to this goodly land, to teach them industry, so- 
briety, honesty and to colonize them in the way that has been done? 
Was it a good work to teach them the cooperative spirit that has been 
manifested throughout the building of our colonies in every part 
of this intermountain country : in the fencing of fields, in the digging 
of irrigation ditches, in the building of canyon roads and bridges ? Is 
all that good or bad? If it is bad, then the tree has brought forth evil 
fruit and we should denounce it : if it is good, then the works speak 
for themselves and we should accept it. 

THE MISSIONARY SYSTEM OF THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS. 

"Mormonism" has sent out, and continues to send out, its young 
men and young women by the hundreds and thousands, making the 
sacrifice of their time and their means, paying their own way in the 
world, going to preach the gospel. They believe with all their hearts 
that here in this Church rests divine authority which was delivered to 
the Prophet Joseph Smith under the administration of John the Bap- 
tist who conferred upon Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery the Aaronic 



126 



GENERAL CONEERENCE. 



Priesthood; and also the administration of Peter, James, and John 
under whose hands Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery received the 
authority of the holy Apostleship. Not the authority of man, but 
divine authority. These young men who go out as missionaries, go 
into the world and deliver the message in their own simple way ; many 
of them not very well learned and many of them educated. And they 
gather up those who will listen and obey. They would be glad to 
have the great and the mighty listen to their messave but as a rule 
they will not. The sacrifice seems to be too great. "Oh, to be called 
a 'Mormon,' " they say ; "we could never stand to be connected with 
that despised people." My own mother was an outcast from her fam- 
ily because she joined this Church, and her people were not wealthy 
people, far from it, but even in their poverty those of her people who 
would not receive this message would have nothing whatever to do 
with her, because, forsooth, she had joined this discredited, unpopular 
religion which 'was denounced as a fraud, a delusion and a snare. 

These elders have gone forth in that way, without purse or scrip, 
so to speak. It is true, they cannot become public charges on the com- 
munities and so they have taken their own means, because there are 
no salaries. They have not asked, "What is the salary or what are you 
going to pay me ?" Not at all, never once. They receive that call and that 
authority under the hands of the priesthood, the servants of the living 
God who hold that Priesthood today; the same Priesthood which was 
committed by Peter, James and John to the Prophet Joseph Smith is 
held here today by President Heber J. Grant and his brethren. The 
same authority, divine authority, is conferred upon these missionaries 
and they go forth and gather up these people and they inspire in their 
hearts faith in God, repentance of sin, baptism for the remission of 
sins and the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost. And 
they also teach them virtue, honesty, industry, and that they must love 
one another, love the Lord with all their heart and their neighbor as 
themselves. These people come from afar and produce what we see. 
Is that missionary work a bad work? If it is, then "Mormonism" is 
bad. But who shall say that that is not the best, the very best work 
that any man could possibly do, to bring the poor of the earth here 
and plant them in this land and make them independent ? Is it desired 
that they shall work for and enrich the Church ? No. But they shall 
enrich themselves so that they shall own their own homes. Is it a bad 
thing for people to own their own homes? You know the cry of 
home building that we hear now on every hand. Well, the Latter-day 
Saint communities own their own homes in larger number than any like 
number of people in all the world. Is that evil? Is that bad? If it is, 
then "Mormonism" is bad. 

THE RESULTS OF THE "MORMON" COLONIZATION POLICY. 

Wherever our Elders have gone, from Canada on the north to Mex- 
ico on the south, in their colonization schemes that has always been the 
result : orderly communities containing meetinghouses, schoolhouses, 



BISHOP CHARLES W. NIBLEY. 



127 



amusement halls. These you will see on every hand. If that one hundred 
years had been spent by the "Mormon" people in Mexico and the peo- 
ple of Mexico at the end of the one hundred years were as degraded 
and wretched and superstitious and in so many ways undesirable as 
we see them today, then you might know that "Mormonism" could not 
be from God. But not so, the very reverse has been true with the 
Latter-day Saints. Not only so, but our social life, our amusements 
that you have heard about this afternoon from Elder McKay, our 
education and our progress in every way show that the fruit has been 
good. President Grant read here yesterday a statement of the differ- 
ent expenditures that have been made from the tithings of the people 
during the year 1919, showing that over $2,300,000 had gone back 
to the Latter-day Saint communities for their numberless activities ; 
among these expenditures was an item of $687,000 for church schools. 
Now remember we pay taxes for the district schools, for the high 
schools, for the agricultural college, for the University, taxes galore 
these days, no end of taxes, but in addition to that we have paid out 
$687,000 from the tithing of our people for the one item of educa- 
tion of the children of the Latter-day Saints; and, indeed, the children 
of others who choose to come to our schools, for we welcome them 
all. Is that bad? If it is, "Mormonism" is bad. 

We have built meetinghouses and churches all over the land. These 
stand as evidences of our work. I remember when I was a boy only 
twenty years of age, over there in the old Social Hall, in 1869, I met 
with some brethren who were called by President Brigham Young to 
go out on missions and he said to us in these words, "I do not want 
you to tell the people that we have a rich country and that they can 
get free land, free this and free the other; do not entice them by the 
promise of wealth and riches. I want you to promise them hard work 
and persecution." That was what President Brigham Young in- 
structed us in those early days to promise the people among whom we 
labored as missionaries. 

A VITALITY IN "MORMONISM" NOT FOUND ELSEWHERE. * _ 

On the announcement of the Prophet Joseph Smith that he had 
received a vision, if, instead of reviling and denouncing and persecut- 
ing him, the people of the world had risen as with one acclaim and 
shouted "Hosanna," and had been thankful for that vision, I would 
have been, I think, in serious doubt myself as to its truth. Why ? Be- 
cause the people of the world never before received a message from 
the Lord in any such spirit. The Master himself had to say to them : 
"Which of the prophets have not your fathers stoned and persecuted ? 
That is the way the message from the Lord has been received now and 
always. So if the people today should rise up and say, These Mor- 
mon" people are just what they claim to be, it would be very different 
indeed from what we have reason to expect fom the history of the past. 
We do not receive that kind of plaudit. But on the contrary as a rule 
we are reviled and scorned. However, I will say that this truth this 
gospel truth, is making its way in the world' and thinking people here 



128 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



and there, men whose opinions are worth having, the judgment of 
one of whom, as Hamlet says, must in our opinion outweigh a whole 
theatre of others, such men begin to think and realize that there is 
a force, a potency, a power and a virility in "Mormonism," a life-giving 
spirit that we do not find anywhere else. 

THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS ARE MULTIPLYING AND REPLENISHING THE 

EARTH. 

In these days when the nations of the earth, France in particular, 
and indeed all the nations are encouraging the rearing of large fam- 
ilies of children — a principle which this Church has taught and preached 
and practiced from the beginning, and even now, when plural mar- 
riage is prohibited by law, and has been for about thirty years, yet 
the practice and the preaching and the doctrines of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is that we shall multiply and re- 
plenish the earth and make the desert blossom as the rose. That has 
been our practice and our teaching. Is that bad? Will any man rise 
up and say that that is bad teaching and that this tree has brought forth 
bad fruit? No, he will not. That is, any sensible man will not. It 
is good. It is what the world is going to call for. 

ENTERTAINMENT AND ORGAN RECITALS FREE. 

Right here on this block we see 300,000 people a year, tourists, 
coming and going every year. There is something a little different 
right here. It is only a small thing but it is worth noting. I have 
traveled and many of you have traveled, for you are the most trav- 
eled community, you Latter-day Saint elders and sisters, of any com- 
munity in all the world, and you have learned by travel as well as 
by study, as this book of Doctrine and Covenants, which contains the 
revelation of the Lord through the Prophet Joseph Smith, tells us to 
seek knowledge by study and by faith and to seek learning from all 
good books. You have been over the world and I have, and I have 
never gone into any cathedral or scarcely any place of note, especially 
in the Old World, but what there has been somebody around to hold 
out his hand and ask for money, or a place would be pointed out to you, 
where you could go and put your money, or in some way or other your 
money would be extracted from you. Here on this block the 300,000 
or more tourists who come and go receive our entertainment and free 
organ recitals and not a cent is taken from them in any shape or form. 
Freely we have received and freely we give. < Our employees here 
would not dare to receive one cent in remuneration for their work from 
the tourists who come here. Now is that bad, think you ? The tour- 
ists do not think so. They think it is pretty good. 

HONESTY AND LOYALTY OF THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS. 

As to loyalty to country, so far as it applies to the "Mormon" 
people, we challenge comparison. We have been taught from our in-

fancy that this is a favored nation. Right here in these revelations to 
the Prophet Joseph Smith you can read in one of them these words, 
that the Lord raised up wise men for the very purpose of framing the 
constitution of this great country, so we have the word of the Lord 
which we accept implicitly that this nation was brought into existence 
by the Divine Power and not altogether by the power of man. It is 
the best government in all the world, the freest, and with all its im- 
perfections, of which there are many, it is the very best, the best that 
the Lord could get the people to accept. He could not have given the 
people anything better because they probably would not have accepted 
it. St. Paul tells us that the gospel of Jesus Christ is a perfect law of 
liberty. And this same gospel that the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints believe in is in advance of the law of the land. It 
is supplementing it. It does not act in contradiction to it; not at all, 
but is upholding it, fostering it, and going a little further in the 
way of perfect liberty. Let me relate one little incident. I remember 
being up in Bear Lake county, Idaho, a good many years ago. A 
brother in the Church owed a debt to a man who was not a member 
of the Church. The late President William Budge, whom most of 
you knew, was then alive and presiding there. This brother could not 
pay his obligation for some time after it became due and the note was 
outlawed according to the law of the land. It was the best law that man 
has been able to devise, and according to that law of the land this 
brother was free from that. debt. No law of the land could touch him. 
But there was a higher law that could supplement the law of the land 
and reach him, and that was the Church law, which says, "Pay your ' 
honest debts ; if you do not you shall not have fellowship with us." Is 
that bad doctrine ? That is the kind of fruit that this tree is producing. 
You think it is bad? I think it is mighty good. So this brother was 
brought up by President William Budge. The debt was proved. He had 
to admit that he owed the obligation, but it had been outlawed and he 
thought nothing more of it. However, he was compelled, so far as 
the rule of the Church could compel him, to pay the debt. Of course, the 
Church could not take his property fromi him, but it could say and 
did say, "You shall have no fellowship with us unless you pay that 
honest debt. We do not care if it were outlawed a hundred times. It 
is an honest debt and you must pay it." And he did pay it. That is 
what I mean when I say there is a higher and better law. 

Now, believing as we do, that this government is an inspiration 
from the Almighty, ought we not to be more loyal to it than those 
who do not so believe ? The Church itself in this respect has done what 
no other Church that I know anything about has been able to do, for 
the Church by the vote of its general conference of all the people, 
authorized the purchase of one million dollars in government bonds 
to assist the government in its time of stress and when it needed the 
help. Do you think that was a bad thing for the Church to do ? Could 
it be charged with disloyalty in doing that ? Show me any other church 
that has done as well. The law of the Church insists that I shall love 
my neighbor and that I shall not hate him. But the law of the land 



130 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



will allow me to go on hating my neighbor with intense and bitter 
hatred if I choose to do so. 

THE CHURCH IS THOUGHTFUL OF THE POOR. 

The law of the land does not ask me to fast on the first Sunday 
in the month but the Church asks me to fast and to give the equivalent 
of the two meals to the poor. My doctor tells me that I am better if 
I do fast ; that the food thus consumed would be wasted on my system 
and that I am really benefited by the fasting. So I have not lost any- 
thing; I have actually been benefited physically and I give, say only 
twenty cents once a month, figuring that meals would not cost over 
ten cents each. I give the twenty cents for the benefit of the poor. 
That simple law if it were practiced by the one hundred ten million 
people in the United States would mean twenty-two million dollars a 
month or two hundred sixty-four million dollars a year, which if wisely 
used would be more than sufficient to provide for the poor abundantly, 
and leave means to spare. Now I call this doctrine of fasting and 
giving to the poor, a mighty good, sound doctrine. Surely no man 
could say there is anything bad about it. 

THE SPIRIT THAT IMPELS TO SACRIFICE AND WORK. 

There is one other thing, greater than all ; greater than all I have 
mentioned; greater than our industry, our colonization and all the 
splendid works that people can see, and it is that which they cannot 
see nor can they comprehend, the spirit that impels us to these works. 
That is a different thing. The wind bloweth where it listeth. We 
cannot hear the sound thereof ; you do not know whence it cometh 
or whither it goeth. So with everyone who is born of this Spirit. You 
received of that Spirit when you believed what the elders said, that 
God had spoken, that these revelations had come to Joseph Smith 
and that they were true. You believed it and you obeyed it accord- 
ing to these commandments. Is there anything wrong about faith, 
about repentance, about baptism, about the laying on of hands for the 
gift of the Holy Ghost? Who will say that that is bad? With the 
compliance of that law and faith has come what we call a testimony, 
a sure knowledge of God, or, as the Scriptures of olden times said, 
you shall grow in grace and in the knowledge of the truth, and if 
you abide in the truth the truth will make you free. Now, no sane 
man will say that that is bad doctrine. Do you think it is ? That spirit 
is what upholds "Mormonism" and sustains it. The knowledge in 
the hearts and souls of its members that God has spoken; that Jesus 
is indeed the Christ, the son of the living God; that Joseph Smith 
did see the vision one hundred years ago. If he did not, if it was all 
a lie, would the fruits that I have mentioned be apparent? Why, 
the logic of the case is irrefutable. It cannot be gainsaid. It must 
stand. It is true. There can be no mistake. It is of God and this 
spirit has gripped the heart and soul of you, true believers, so that you 
know of the doctrines, as the Savior said, "Whether they be of God or 



BISHOP CHARLES IV. NIBLEY. 



131 



whether I speak of myself." And in consequence of that knowledge 
you have been willing to make great sacrifices. That is what this 
spirit has brought greater than all else that I have mentioned, the 
spirit of sacrifice in the heart. 

May we learn to keep that first and greatest commandment of 
God, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and might 
and mind and strength." The Lord says to us, "Son, give me thine 
heart." That rich young man mentioned in the Scriptures could not 
do it. He was an acceptable, good worshiper, very good. He was an 
acceptable man and a very good citizen. When he asked the Savior, 
"Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?" the answer was, 
"Keep the commandments." Well, but which commandments? The 
Savior repeated a number of the Ten Commandments to him, and 
that young man, a good citizen, clean, virtuous, good man, could 
say, "All these I have kept from my youth up." Now you would 
say that was a first-class young man. He was truly an acceptable citi- 
zen. Nobody could ask any more. But was he willing to sacrifice 
and give his heart to God? No. As a matter of fact, he had not kept 
the first great commandment which I have repeated to you, but the 
Savior could look right through him, and to put him to the test told 
him to sell all that he had and give it to the poor and then "come 
follow me." The sacrifice was too great for the young man; he 
could not give his heart to God and could not make the sacrifice. 

THE TREE OF "MORMONISM" HAS BORNE GOOD FRUIT, NOT BAD. 

You have made sacrifices, our parents have made sacrifices for 
these truths. We have lived in poverty — I myself in the direst pov- 
erty here in the early days in northern Utah. As a young lad I lived 
in a dugout with a quilt for a door, not even a window, not even a 
board floor, just dirt for a floor; lived without sufficient nourishing 
food; sometimes I did not have enough to eat, but the spirit that was 
in my father and in my mother was to stay by this truth, to be loyal 
to this people and to this Church. They could say: "Whither they go 
I will go ; where they stay I will stay, their people shall be my people 
and their God my God." That was the sacrifice they were willing 
to make, and they did make it. Shall I now, shall our people after us, 
now when they have made these great sacrifices, not give our hearts 
to God? If we are asked to go on a mission shall we not go? If it 
is to be a teacher on the block or to teach in the Sunday School or 
any work however simple, shall we not answer with our whole heart, 
"Tell me what you wish me to do ; show me my work and I will try 
to do it." For the work is good, the work is true, the work has pro- 
duced results that no other institution or organization in all the world 
can produce. This spirit has taught us honor, virtue, integrity, and 
loyalty to country and all that is good and that makes for righteous- 
ness This spirit of sacrifice has been planted in our hearts by the 
power of the Holy Ghost. By that we live, by that we magnify this 
work by that power we stand by these brethren and uphold the Priest- 
hood of the Son of God. As to the principles of virtue and honor, no 



132 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



church in all the world sets such a high standard for its adherents, 
for there is no double standard of morality taught in the revelations 
of the Lord to the Prophet Joseph Smith. The man indeed is more 
the criminal than the woman. That is what is taught, that is what we 
try to practice. Now is that bad or is it good ? If it is bad, then the 
Prophet Joseph Smith may have been a deceiver. If it is all good, and 
we know it is good, all of it good and righteous; then it must follow 
as the night the day that the Prophet Joseph Smith did see the visions 
one hundred years ago. These are the fruits of "Mormonism." The 
young man, Joseph Smith, was not a falsifier. This tree which was 
planted one hundred years ago has borne good fruit and not evil. Then 
there can be no mistake ; his testimony must be true, it cannot be 
gainsaid. As I said, the logic of the case is irrefutable. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang: "Now let us rejoice," and the 
conference adjourned until Tuesday morning at 10 a. m. 

Prayer was offered by Elder John W. Hart of the Rigby stake 
of Zion. 



THIRD DAY 

Conference continued in the tabernacle, Tuesday morning, April ■ 
6. President Heber J. Grant called the meeting to order at 10 o'clock. 

The choir and congregation sang, "O ye mountains high," by 
President Charles W. Pemose, the hymn being read by President 
Grant before being sung. (See L. D. S. Hymn Book, p. 376.) 

Elder Mark Austin, President of the Fremont stake of Zion, of- 
fered the opening prayer. 

Choir and congregation sang, "Come, come, ye Saints, no toil 
nor labor fear." 

ELDER GEO. F. RICHARDS 

Ninety years ago today the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints was organized in Fayette, Seneca county, New York, with six 
members, and today we celebrate in conference the anniversary of that 
glorious event. 

OUR ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION IMPRESSIVE AND GLORIOUS. 

One hundred years ago, possibly today, that other great event 
transpired when God the Eternal Father and his Son, Jesus Christ, con- 
descended to appear unto the boy Joseph Smith, not yet fifteen years 
of age, whom the Lord had raised up to represent him in the usher- 
ing in of the gospel dispensation of the fulness of times. In our con- 
ference we have been celebrating also this glorious event, and taking, 
in connection with our conference sessions, the presentation last even-

133 



ing, by Brother Evan Stephens and the choir, of that beautiful cantata, 
"The Vision," with the words so appropriate, the story so beautifully 
told and set to music and sung with such inspiration, I feel that the 
celebration has been most fitting, impressive, and glorious. 

I was pleased to hear expressions from some distinguished visitors 
we had with us yesterday that they were profoundly impressed by 
our services. I feel sure, that all those who have attended this con- 
ference, being honest in their hearts, and desiring the uplift of human- 
ity, have been similarly impressed, and I have felt, during -this confer- 
ence, as no doubt you have also, that it only requires time for this, 
our religion, to make its way. "Mormonism" is in the ascendency. I 
rejoice with all my heart to be identified with this work which I know 
is true. I know that there is in it the power of God unto salvation 
in this life and in the life to come. And though we have been in a 
minority, and are still, so far as members are concerned, the time 
will come when the truths which we represent, which we are trying 
to live, and which we have preached to the world for nearly a hun- 
dred years, will triumph and prevail over error. 

SIGNIFICANCE OF JOSEPH^ GREAT VISION. 

The importance of the Great Vision referred to, justifies, I 
think, directing my remarks particularly thereto, notwithstanding 
nearly all of the speakers in the conference have spoken upon that sub- 
ject. I would call attention by reading again a verse from the sayings 
of Joseph himself, telling his own story, so that we may be refreshed 
in our minds. In regard to what the Son told Joseph, he says : "I was 
answered that I must join none of them, for they were all wrong; and 
the personage who addressed me said that all their creeds were an 
abomination in his sight ; that those professors were all corrupt ; that 
'they draw near to me with their lips, but their hearts are far from 
me ; they teach for doctrines the commandments of men, having a 
form of godliness, but they deny the power thereof.' " 

I know not, my brethren and sisters, how offensive this state- 
ment is to the sectarian world, but we accept it as the words of God 
and not of men, and we think that they are defensible. For instance, 
the saying that Joseph was to join with none of them, for they were 
all wrong, that means to us that there had been a departure from the 
truth, and from the Church that was instituted' in the days of the 
Savior. Now then, let us reason upon this for a moment. I might 
call your attention, in connection with this matter, to a saying of the 
Lord through his servant Isaiah, in regard to his knowledge of things 
which are to be, recorded in the 46th chapter of Isaiah: "I am God, 
and there is none like me, declaring the end from the beginning, and 
from ancient times all things that are not. yet done." The Prophet 
Amos says : "Surely the Lord God doeth nothing but he revealeth his 
secrets to his servants, the prophets." Whether or not we might 
call the apostasy a secret, it certainly was known to the Lord in ad- 
vance and we might reason thus : If there was to be a universal 



134 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



apostasy from the Church, then the Lord would reveal that important 
fact to his servants, the prophets. 

Joseph Smith, a boy fourteen years of age, however, had not 
studied this proposition out in this way, to reach the deductions that 
we have reached, but by a study of the scriptures, we do find that the 
Lord, through his prophets, did predict the apostate conditions which 
were to be. And reasoning a little further we conclude that if there 
had been a universal apostasy such a thing would be of record. So 
we consult the histories by men who have written upon ecclesiastical 
subjects, and we find the apostasy given in minute detail, step by 
step, until it had become universal. "The earth had become defiled 
under the inhabitants thereof," for they had transgressed the laws, 
changed the ordinances, and broken the everlasting covenant. Men 
would wander from sea to sea, and from the north even unto the south, 
seeking the words of the Lord and could not find them. So far, 
therefore, as this declaration is concerned, there is sufficient evidence 
before us to prove that the statement is true that- they were all wrong. 

. Now in regard to that other statement : All their creeds were an 
■ abomination in his sight ; that seems a serious arraignment of churches, 
and their creeds. Let us consider that a moment. What consti- 
tutes or may constitute an abomination in the sight of God? It does 
seem to me that the belief in and advocacy of that which is not true 
and the making of it a part of religious creeds must be abominable 
in the sight of him who is the God of truth. If the Savior had not 
told Joseph this great fact, the evidence of it was before him, and he 
would no doubt have discovered it in later years as his judgment de- 
veloped, for he knew that in the creeds everywhere it was taught that 
God is a personage having no body, no parts, nor passions. Joseph now 
saw before him the Father, not such as was represented by the creeds, 
but an immortal, glorified being, and with him his Son. Of this there 
could be no mistake, for the one, introducing the other to Joseph, 
said : "This is my beloved Son, hear him." There Joseph saw the 
Father and the Son, the Son indeed in the very likeness and image of 
his father. 

An examination of the creeds will reveal other principles there 
set forth which are man-made and are in conflict with the truth of 
heaven as it has been revealed and is recorded in the scriptures of 
the Holy Bible, as well as in the other standard works of this Church. 
It was a necessary thing that Joseph, whom the Lord had raised up 
to be his mouthpiece for the ushering in of this great gospel dispensa- 
tion, preparing the way for the great and glorious coming of our Lord, 
should have a perfect knowledge of the Father and of the Son, that he 
might be able to stand and to be secure in his position and to accom- 
plish his work which the Lord had for him to do, and a wonderful 
work it has been. 

When our first parents were shut out from the Garden of Eden, 
they were told to worship the Lord their God all the days of their 
lives, and as they prayed, we are told that the voice of the Lord came 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS. 



135 



from toward the Garden of Eden, for they were shut out from his 
presence, and the Apostle Paul declares to the Corinthians that we 
are required to live by faith and not by sight, but, notwithstanding 
this fact, the Lord has left abundant evidences of his existence, of his 
power, and of his love. We have the argument of the Apostle Paul 
upon this point, which I consider is very forceful. He says : "For the 
invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, 
being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power 
and Godhead, so that they are without excuse." 

THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OP JOSEPH AN EVIDENCE OF THE DIVINITY 

OF HIS CALLING. 

As the things which God has done are evidences of his existence, 
power, and love, so the things that were accomplished by Joseph Smith 
are an evidence of the divinity of his calling and that he was sup- 
ported and sustained by his Father in heaven. Not only did he have 
a visitation from the Father and the Son, but the Father also spoke 
to him by the mouth of the angel Moroni, who delivered to Joseph the 
plates from which the Book of Mormon was translated, which book 
contains a fulness of the gospel as delivered by Christ, our Savior 
himself to the ancient inhabitants of this American continent, and 
this in fulfilment of the predictions that there should be a restoration 
of the gospel by an angel, which thing could not have been, had there 
not first been a falling away. 

The organizing of the Church, ninety years ago today, was the 
beginning of the establishment of the Church and Kingdom of God 
that was to be set up, according to the predictions of the prophets, 
never to be thrown down nor given to another people. It is to fill 
the whole world. The perfection and efficiency of the Church or- 
ganization prove that Joseph was divinely inspired. By the mouth of 
John the Baptist the keys of the Aaronic Priesthood were conferred 
upon Joseph and Oliver which enabled them to baptize, a power and 
authority that was not known and that did not exist in the sectarian 
churches. 

The keys of the Melchizedek Priesthood also were conferred by 
Peter, James and John, enabling the Prophet, with those who should 
assist him, to accomplish all the work pertaining to this great latter- 
day dispensation. 

Moses committed unto him the keys of the gathering of scattered 
Israel from the four parts of the earth, and the leading of the ten 
tribes from the land of the north. Zion is being gathered in fulfilment 
of the predictions of the prophets under this spirit of gathering that 
came through Moses. 

Elias conferred the keys of the Abrahamic dispensation in which 
he lived, and Elijah the keys of the turning of the hearts of the fath- 
ers to the children and the children to the fathers, lest the whole earth 
be smitten with a curse. That spirit, too, is abroad in the world. 
Temples are built, and the work is being accomplished for the 
dead as well as for the living, and all these things, with the thou- 



136 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



sands of other great accomplishments under the direction and organiza- 
tion of the Prophet Joseph, prove him to be a true prophet of God. 

In view of the importance of this, the dispensation of the fulness 
of times, it is only reasonable to believe that our Father would reserve 
one of the greatest of those noble spirits who were faithful in their 
previous state of existence, to come forth and lead the people of this 
dispensation as his mouthpiece and prophet. This we believe was 
done, and that Joseph Smith was one of the greatest prophets that 
ever lived, and that his life's work was one of the greatest that ever 
a prophet accomplished. 

There is another evidence which is more convincing to me, even 
than all these, and that is the witness of the Spirit of God that comes 
through the Holy Ghost, bearing testimony to my soul. I am con- 
vinced in every fiber of my being that Joseph Smith was indeed a 
divinely inspired prophet of God, and that his story of the vision is 
true, and I bear this testimony to you today in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

A duet, "Hail to the brightness of Zion's glad morning," was 
sung by J. R. Boshard and Florence Meldrum. 

PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAWSON 

The opening remarks of the President at this conference were 
very inspiring and gave promise of a rich outpouring of the Spirit 
of the Lord upon the people. It has been so — a time of peace, a 
time of instruction, of thanksgiving and praise and of pure joy. 

ETERNAL AND TEMPORAL VALUES. 

I would like to say a few words this morning, my brethren and 
sisters, upon the subject of investments, and I will take for my text the 
saying of a noted writer to this effect: "Always distinguish between 
what is of eternal value, and of what is a mere temporal ease." This 
is a significant remark. It is worthy of the profoundest considera- 
tion. There are many things with which we come in contact, many 
things of importance, but there are some things that are more import- 
ant than others. 

This is the land of Zion in which we dwell. It is a blessed land, 
it is a fruitful land. The soil readily responds to the industry of 
the farmer, and by his toil means come into his possession. The wages 
of the laboring man today are very good. He gets a splendid reward 
for his efforts and thereby means come into his hands. It is true, 
that we are confronted with high cost of living, but notwithstanding 
this, with many of our people, perhaps hundreds and hundreds of 
them, there is a surplus, and, I believe, as remarked by Brother 
Stephen L. Richards, that with this surplus there comes the responsi- 
bility of trusteeship. The means that come into our hands are a 



PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAW SON. 



137 



direct blessing from the Lord and he expects us to expend them wisely 
and well and to be very careful in our management of affairs. I 
think that the Lord particularly expects us as a people to avoid debt. 
A man who is weighed down by a burden of debt might just as well be 
in prison, because it is to him a constant worry and anxiety. 

One of the first considerations that devolves upon us is to get 
out of debt. The Latter-day Saints should heed this counsel, for it is 
counsel that comes to us from time to time from the leaders of the 
Church. 

The mercantile world, the oil business, the mining fields, offer 
opportunity for investment of our surplus ; but, brethren and sisters, 
the very greatest wisdom and judgment should be exercised in the 
matter of investment. And when it comes to mining stocks it needs 
only to be said that this is a very risky business, and so the Latter- 
day Saints should be wise and prudent and not rush hastily into 
enterprises that spring up on every side. There is danger in it. Some- 
times offerings come to us from a distance, some great undertaking 
that reads well on paper, the prospectus of which is very fine. It 
is inspiring, it is enticing. Wonderful things, it is announced, will be 
accomplished if we will only put our money into it, and yet possibly 
we do not know a mortal thing about the people who are connected 
with the enterprise. Who is the president? Oh, well, we don't 
know. We have never seen him. Who are the directors in the com- 
pany? Oh, well, we don't know, but just look at the prospectus, see 
what it says. Isn't that sufficient? No, I say it is not. It is not 
sufficient at all. People ought not to go into those things without 
knowing something of the character of the people who are behind them. 
Now this is true also of enterprises abroad in the world that come to 
us. It is true, likewise, of enterprises at home, even right here in Zion. 
When investments are offered they should be subjected to the great- 
est scrutiny and careful investigation. We want to know, should know 
who is behind them. What is the character of the man who stands 
at the head? What is the character of the men who make up the 
board of directors, and who administer the affairs of the company? 
Are they safe men, are they strong men, reliable people of the com- 
munity? Well, if they are, then the risk is not so great, of course, 
and so, I think that it would be much safer for the Latter-day Saints 
generally to invest their means at home in enterprises that have 
originated among us, in enterprises that have been and are suc- 
cessful in which the stock is paying good returns. It is the results 
that we want. And that reminds me of a story. 

One man said to another : "What is Professor Jones doing now ?" 

"Oh, well, he is trying to decipher a Babylonian tablet." 

"Are there any results?" 

"Yes, his wife is down with nervous prostration, and he has sent 
his children to relatives." 

Very definite results. And so, when we come to invest our means, 
we want results, we want good results. A successful man from a 
worldly standpoint is a man who makes' good investments. An un- 



138 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



successful man is a man who makes unsuccessful investments and 
the results are poor and bring trouble and anxiety to him. Now, 
these things are very important. We have to deal with them. We must 
accumulate means for we have certain obligations that rest upon us, 
the support of our families, the education of our children, the main- 
tainence of our homes. The man who will not provide for his family, 
the Apostle said, is worse than an infidel, and so these obligations de- 
volve upon us. 

AN INVESTMENT OF ETERNAL VALUE. 

But the thing that I have been emphasizing might be regarded 
as something pertaining to a mere temporal ease. Let us pause for 
a moment, let us reflect upon some investments that have an eternal 
value. What think you of tithing as an investment? "Why, Brother 
Clawson," says someone in surprise, "you don't pretend to say that 
the paying of tithing into the Church is an investment. When a 
man puts his money into the hands of the Lord's bishop, or into the 
bishop's storehouse, and he doesn't get any apparent dividend from 
it, why, you don't call that an investment?" 

Yes, that is an investment of an eternal nature. 

"Oh, I think you are mistaken, Brother Clawson, about that. 
You know tithing pertains to temporal things and is a temporal law 
and there is nothing eternal connected with it." 

Oh, yes, I think there is a spiritual value connected with tithing 
and it is made very apparent, in the revelation upon that subject. 
The question arises, what is tithing for? We speak of it, we em- 
phasize it in our conferences, we urge the people to remember the 
law and to honor it. Now what is it for? We are not left in the 
dark regarding this matter. The Lord has made it clear. He gave 
the law. No man is responsible for it. The prophet of the Church, 
the president, is not responsible for this word from the Lord. "Tith- 
ing is for the building of mine house," says the Lord, "and for the 
laying of the foundation of Zion and for the priesthood and for the 
debts of the presidency of my Church." That is what it is for, and that 
has an eternal significance and fixed value, and I look upon it as a 
splendid investment. Is it not a privilege, is it not an opportunity 
to assist in the laying of the foundation of Zion? That is what we 
have been doing for ninety years. Nearly a hundred years we have 
been laying the foundation of Zion. Is it laid yet, is it fully laid, 
thoroughly laid ? I would not say it. I do not know, I think it will re- 
quire all of a hundred years and more to lay the foundation, be- 
cause upon it we are building the Church and Kingdom of God, 
which is never to be thrown down, and the work will never 
be given to other people. That is the kind of a foundation we must 
lay. You have had a hand in it, I have had part in it ; that is, if we 
have observed this law and other duties and obligations. Oh, it is a 
blessed thing. I think it will pay a good dividend. 

"And for the building of mine house" — here on this block is one

spiritual blessings will come to the Latter-day Saints, largely through 
the paying of their tithing and obligations. 

Now, I will tell you, we could not build a house of God without 
means and yet, when it is accomplished, the building itself is of least 
importance, all the means that went into it is of the least importance. 
It is the ordinances of the house that are of eternal value. And then 
again the law of tithing speaks of the Priesthood. There is an invest- 
ment for you of real worth, of most vital significance, the authority 
and power of the Priesthood. Could any man make a better invest- 
ment than to secure the Priesthood? "Yes, but Brother Clawson, can 
he buy this blessing?" No, no, he can not. "Well, how can he invest 
if he has no money to put into it ?" You can't get in that way. It is 
an investment that comes in a different form entirely. Well, what is 
required? Only faithfulness, a faithful life, devotion to the cause of 
God, obedience to his word, honoring his servants, and doing your 
duty, and that will entitle you to have a share in this great investment 
that is open to all the men of the Church from the least to the great- 
est. 

"And the debts of the Presidency of my Church." I do not take 
that to mean that the tithing is to be used for the personal obligations 
and debts of the leading men of the Church or the Presidency. You 
notice how this reads : "Of the debts of the Presidency of my Church." 
It means the obligations entered into for the Church by the Presidency. 

THE WORD OF WISDOM AS AN ETERNAL INVESTMENT. 

What think you, brethren and sisters, of the Word of Wisdom as 
an investment ? "Surely it is not an investment, is it ?" Oh, yes ; one 
of the brethren at this conference has emphasized the Word of Wisdom 
by saying that it might be regarded as the law of health, the great 
law of health. Well, is not that an investment worthy of our con- 
sideration? If we can go into anything, brethren and sisters, that 
will bring good health, that is the very best kind of a dividend there 
is. And what could we do? I submit to you, what could this people 
do, how much could they accomplish of this mighty work without 
good health? Well, now, as a people we are healthy. There may be 
exceptions to the rule, but we are entitled to the special blessings of 
the Lord in this respect if we observe his great law. "Yes," but some- 
one says, "you are emphasizing, my brother, investments of an eternal 
character. The Word of Wisdom, remember, is a temporal law and 
does not have anything particularly to do with eternal things." Well, 
I think, my brother, that you are slightly mistaken in that view. I 
grant you that the Word of Wisdom has a temporal side to it. It 
pertains largely to temporal things, to our physical health, the condi- 
tion of our bodies and so on. But there is also a spiritual side to the 
Word of Wisdom which possibly is more important than the temporal, 
for the Lord said that all Saints who remember to keep and do these 
sayings of the Word of Wisdom, walking in obedience to the com- 
mandments, "shall receive health in their navel and marrow to their 
bones." There is the temporal blessing and it is important and vital. 



140 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



"And shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even 
hidden treasures." And there is the spiritual side to the Word of Wis- 
dom. And these great treasures of knowledge will help us in this 
world and will follow us into the world to come and are of an eternal 
nature. We also have the promise that the destroying angel shall 
pass us by and not slay us. That does not mean, that no one among 
the Saints shall die and pass away. We are under the great edict of 
life, that is, sooner or later, we must lay down our bodies and pass into 
the spirit world, and the change will come to all of us ; but the prom- 
ise is made, nevertheless, and the Lord will have respect for his peo- 
ple. He will bless them and he will preserve them and carry them 
along until they shall have fulfilled the measure of their creation and 
accomplished their work, if they will observe to keep and do these 
sayings and render obedience to his law. 

MARRIAGE AN ETERNAL INVESTMENT. 

What think you, brethren and sisters, of marriage as an invest- 
ment? One of the most important steps that a man or woman can 
take in the world. There are two kinds of marriage. One is rather 
a poor investment, that is, it is not as good as the other. There is 
marriage for time ; there is marriage for time and all eternity. Here 
is the choice of two investments to every young man and to every 
young woman in the Church. Which will you have? That which is 
of eternal value or the thing that is of mere temporal ease? So I 
repeat, always distinguish between what is of eternal value and what 
is of a mere temporal ease." 

The Lord bless us and help us to make the proper choice and to 
do the right thing ; always to give ear to the voice of counsel, and walk 
in the way of life, is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER CHARLES H. HART 

(Of the First Council of Seventy) 
The strong testimonies given by the brethren during this con- 
ference, of the great vision, and developments connected therewith, 
and the unexpressed testimonies represented by those in attendance 
here, — are partly due to the gracious wisdom and foresight of our 
heavenly Father in carefully providing direct evidences sufficient to 
satisfy reasonable minds of the truths of these important events. There 
is no exact standard of the amount of evidence which should be suf- 
ficient to convince each reasonable mind. 

HOW EVIDENCE IS MEASURED. 

You cannot measure evidence or testimony by the ounce or by 
the pound, nor even by the number of witnesses, although the number 
may be of importance. I am persuaded that the Lord does not place 
a premium upon undue credulity. While he leaves a wise margin for 
faith, hope and confiding belief, he also provides proper evidence. 
We are told in the scriptures that, "The simple believeth every word, 
but the prudent man looketh well to his going." This is a good pro- 



ELDER CHARLES H. HART. 



141 



verb for the brethren to bear in mind when some oily-tongued agent 
comes to them with a beautifully lithographed certificate of stock in 
some "wild-cat" corporation, concerning which Brother Clawson has 
just told us. If they are in the frame of mind to believe every word 
and are not like the prudent man who "looketh well to his going," 
they will have time afterwards to repent of their over-confidence. 

In the coming forth of "Mormonism," the Lord provided ample 
testimony, — a goodly number of witnesses. As I said before, the 
number does not count for everything, because there is a more delicate 
test for reaching the truth than in the mere weight of numbers, al- 
though some importance is properly placed upon the number of wit- 
nesses. It was foreordained thtit there should be three special wit- 
nesses, besides Joseph, to the coming of the Book of Mormon. In the 
Constitution of the United States, two witnesses are necessary to con- 
vict for treason, and there must be two witnesses to the same overt 
act. Under the law of Moses, two or three witnesses were required 
to establish guilt punishable by death. (17 Deut. 6.) This rule was 
later perverted by the Jews, as the Talmud informs us that a witness 
though truthful might be punished if he were unfortunate enough not 
to have another witness to corroborate his story. 

I think the American frame of mind is somewhat illustrated in 
an event which occurred some years ago, wherein one of the large 
dailies of New York represented that it had performed a certain 
experiment in order to prove the incompetency of the editors of the 
magazines of the day, and asserted that the paper had sent out copies 
of good stories from Kipling, without disclosing the authorship, and 
that those stories had been rejected by magazines of supposed good 
judgment and literary skill. The statement went unchallenged for 
some time, until Mr. Edward Bok, editor of the Ladies' Home Journal, 
came forward and said : "We would like proof of that ; we would like 
to be shown." 

In connection with the coming forth of "Mormonism," for a 
long while the burden rested upon the testimony of Joseph alone, and 
it was a tremendous' weight that he carried, and how relieved he felt 
when there were others who were to share the responsibility with him ! 
Yet I take it that his uncorroborated statements, so far as having 
other witnesses to support him, would carry conviction to the earnest 
seeker of truth. What are jurors instructed to do when they are 
considering the weight to be attached to testimony which will result, 
perhaps, in the conviction for a high crime or misdemeanor? They 
are charged that they may consider the demeanor of the witness, his 
means of information, the opportunities which he has had for knowing 
the truth of which he testifies ; the interest, if any, which he has in the 
case, his intelligence, or lack of intelligence; and from all the cir- 
cumstances appearing upon the trial, determine what credence should 
be given to his testimony, and to give weight accordingly; that in 
case of a conflict in evidence they may believe one witness as against 
many, and that they are to search for the truth, believing that which 
carries conviction to them. 



142 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



THE TESTIMONY OF JOSEPH SMITH THE PROPHET. 

We have before us the printed record. We do not have the ad- 
vantage of hearing the oral word. Perhaps only a few present ever 
heard the oral testimony of those concerned. But we can read the 
printed word; and that is the means which the great courts of our 
land have, because our supreme courts are courts of appellate jurisdic- 
tion, and most of the cases considered by them come to them by ap- 
peal, and they do not see nor hear the witnesses but tbey read the 
printed record, and determine from that, the weight that should be 
attached to the testimony. You may read the testimony of Joseph, and 
the testimony of Oliver, and with no other testimony supporting it, 
it will carry conviction to your soul. 

To illustrate what I mean, my brethren and sisters, may I read 
a few words from the testimony of Joseph. He is comparing his re- 
sponsibility and knowledge with that of Paul of old, and he goes on 
to say: 

So it was with me, I had actually seen a light, and in the midst of 
that light I saw two personages, and they did in reality speak to me, and 
though I was hated and persecuted for saying I had seen a vision, yet it 
was true; and while they were persecuting me, reviling me, and speaking 
all manner of evil against me falsely for so saying, I was led to say in 
think to make me deny what I have actually seen? For I had seen a 
vision, and who am I that I can withstand God, or why does the world 
think to make me deny what I have actually seen? For I had seen a 
vision; I knew it, and I knew that God knew it, and I could not deny 
it; neither dared I do it, at least, I knew that bv so doing I would offend 
God, and come under condemnation. (Pearl of Great Price.) 

There is printed here as a note to the Pearl of Great Price, a let- 
ter from Oliver Cowdery, that rings with that same spirit of sincerity. 
It should carry conviction to the heart, it seems to me, of all who 
read it in sincerity, and with a desire to know the truth. 

IMPROBABILITY OF SUPERNATURAL EVENTS. 

Some will say : "What of the improbability of these supernatural 
events which were testified to by Joseph, and particularly by the 
three witnesses?" Well, the fact that an occurrence is improbable 
does not interfere with its being established. In fact, it is proverbial 
that "the unexpected happens." It is one of the established rules of 
evidence that the improbable may be established where the testimony 
is sufficient. The term improbable simply means what appears un- 
reasonable to the individual to whom the testimony is given, in the 
light of his knowledge and experience. As an illustration, a scriptural 
illustration of what I mean by establishing the improbable, — when 
Jacob was informed that Joseph was alive and was a ruler in Egypt, 
we are told in the scriptures that "Jacob's heart fainted, for he be- 
lieved them not;" but, of course, sufficient testimony was brought 
to prove what seemed to Jacob at first to be an improbability. So, if 
some of these matters seem to be improbable, it does not, under the 
rules of evidence, prevent the establishment of them. Besides, the 



ELDER CHARLES H. HART. 



143 



improbable is based on man's experience, but the things which are 
impossible with man are possible with God. 

I think Brother Joseph Fielding Smith reached the correct con- 
clusion that there is no middle ground between accepting Joseph as 
a sincere prophet of the Lord, or a conscious deceiver: for you can- 
not conceive of Joseph being deceived in the experiences of which he 
testifies ; that he could be baptized under the direction of a heavenly 
being, have other heavenly personages appear to him, laying their 
hands upon his head and conferring the holy Priesthood upon him, 
and he be deceived in all that, — deceived in a messenger appearing and 
showing the records and the precious relics contained in the stone 
box to which he was directed. It is out of the question to believe 
that he could be deceived, or that the three witnesses or the eight 
witnesses could be, in what they testify to. I grant that one man, 
or perhaps several, may sometimes be deceived in the sense of sight. 
You brethren and sisters perhaps have seen the phenomenon of the 
mirage of the desert. You have looked across a body of water and 
seen horses and cows that looked like poplar trees, or a train coming 
at a distance, which in the particular refraction of the light appeared 
many times as tall as it really was. But to suppose that these men 
could be deceived in what they said would be to assume the improb- 
able, I was going to say the impossible, that a large group of men 
would be deceived, not only in the sense of sight, but in the sense 
of hearing, and in the physical sense of touch as well; because all 
these senses were appealed to. 

FUTILITY OF ACCOUNTING FOR "MORMONISM" ON THE GROUND OF 
WILFUL IMPOSTURE. 

Then if you take the other alternative and try to account for 
"Mormonism" on the ground of wilful imposture, there are many 
difficulties that you encounter. Did you ever consider just what 
would be involved in looking at the case from that viewpoint? A 
great jurist, says : 

Where several persons conspire to commit perjury, there must # be 
concert, they must first be persons so depraved that they are willing to join 
in the commission of high crime and so lost to all sense of shame as to 
be willing to confess their infamy one to another; they must likewise 
agree not only upon the main body of their story, but upon its details and 
upon the order in which they occurred, and if, while they are undergoing 
the ordeal of cross-examination, defects in their story are exposed they 
will not dare to change it, for if they do, they will run the risk of being 
contradicted by their associates, and if they adhere to it, they know they 
will incur the hazard of detection together with all of its dangerous con- 
sequences. I. ; i il jSI-sJ.£J 

And in connection with the number of witnesses testifying, if 
the Prophet Joseph had been an impostor, he would have appreciated 
the danger of having more people in league with him. Increasing 
the number of witnesses would tend to increase the probability of his 
being exposed. 



1.44 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Another authority on evidence, the author of a great text book, 
reminds us of this: 

Increasing the number of false witnesses increases the probability of 
detection in a very high proportion: for it multiplies the number of points 
upon which their statements may be compared with each other and also 
the number of points where their testimony comes in contact with the 
truth, and therefore multiplies the danger of inconsistency and variance in 
the same proportion. 

Again, the burden of proof is on the party who alleges fraud. 
It is never presumed, because fraud is a crime. Men are presumed to 
do right. One of the strongest and most far reaching presumptions 
of evidence is the presumption of innocence, — the presumption of right 
acting. It is easier for a person to tell the truth than to tell a false- 
hood, because in telling the truth it is an act of memory, simply 
recalling the actual experience ; while falsehood involves invention, skill 
in invention, to make the story appear plausible. 

Who could read Joseph's utterances throughout his life, who could 
read, for instance, that little diary, yet unprinted so far as I know, 
written in his own handwriting, at the time he took his mission 
to Canada, disclosing the prayerful nature of his heart day by day, and 
say that such a person could possibly be a deceiver? Or who could 
imagine one offering the highest test of fidelity that mortal man can 
give, going chee'rfully and knowingly to his death, as a Socrates or* as 
a Christ, and so offering his life for his testimony, sealing his testi- 
mony with his life's precious blood, and not be sincere? Every act, 
every utterance of the Prophet, is in accordance with this rightful 
position as the great prophet of latter days, and every word of it is 
directly inconsistent with any assumption that he was not sincere, that 
he was not what he professed to be. 

For some years it was a matter of regret, serious regret upon my 
part as a boy, to think that some of the witnesses were weak enough 
to side-step from the straight and narrow path. But I think that even 
in that, there was a providence of the Lord in strengthening this case, 
because it is out of all question, in considering the attitude of Joseph 
toward those witnesses, both the three and the eight, and in con- 
sidering their attitude, to suppose that any such a thing as a conspiracy 
was involved. The case in support of the restoration of the gospel is 
very greatly strengthened by the witnesses, being disciplined and yet re- 
maining true to their testimonies. 

May the Lord bless us and help us to realize in every deed, day 
by day, not only while we are in this presence or in the congregations 
of the Saints, but every day, and all the time, that these great facts 
are indeed truths, and that a great responsibility rests upon each one 
of us to act in accordance with these convictions, and in accordance 
with the responsibility placed upon us to bear this testimony to the 
world. May the Lord bless us, and help us to perform that high 
mission to the world, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

We have with us this morning Patriarch Harrison Sperry, who 
came here in 1847, in my father's company, and we will be very 
pleased indeed to hear from him. He has more hair on his head, and 
less gray hair, than I have, although I think he is about eighty-nine 
years of age. He will tell us when he gets up here. 

PATRIARCH HARRISON SPERRY 

(Of the Granite Stake of Zion) 

Brother Ileber tells me that there are ten or twelve minutes foi 
me to speak. Yes, T came here in the c mpany of Brother Heber's 
father, in 1847 : and r think that I couid almost preach a sermon that 
I heard him preach over seventy-two years ago. I have been in the 
Church a long time. I was baptized about seventy-nine years ago. I have 
seen the Prophet Joseph Smith. I heard him talk. He was one of the 
most noble men that ever lived upon the face of this earth. I think 
he brought more knowledge to the human family than any prophet 
who ever lived upon the face of the earth. He brought more knowl- 
edge in regard to the living and the dead than all of the prophets 
that ever lived, even Moses himself, who talked with God, and so did 
that Prophet Joseph. He talked with the angel Moroni nine or ten 
times. Moroni told him some of the most wonderful truths that were 
ever told upon the face of the earth. When Joseph received the prin- 
ciples in regard to baptism for the dead, he entered the Mississippi 
river and commenced to baptize all that had come to him. The 
Lord cautioned him, and said : "Joseph, this must be done in the 
temple of the Lord, and a record must be kept." Then Joseph went 
to work and rushed the temple in Nauvoo with all of his might. I 
have been around that temple many a time, and what a noble edifice it 
was that was built there in Nauvoo. There is a long story that I 
could tell, but there isn't time. I have been here in these valleys 
now for almost seventy-three years. Brigham Young — I have been 
acquainted with him ; President John Taylor, — I was well acquainted 
with him : Brother Woodruff, — I was well acquainted with him : our 
farms joined together ; and Brother Snow, that noble man of God, well 
acquainted with him; Joseph F. Smith— well acquainted with him. 
When his mother had a little farm down here upon the country road. 
I went there and helped them to harvest their little grain. Joseph F. 
.was a little boy then, about nine or ten years old. I ate dinner with him 
and his noble mother, and Joseph told me: 

"Brother Sperry, I was born away up there in Missouri during that 
great trouble, and my mother laid me down upon a bed and spread 
some quilts over me, and when they came to me, Brother Sperry, 
my face was almost as black as your coat ; I was almost dead." 

Oh, Joseph, the Lord works in mysterious ways, doesn't he ? Oh, 
surely, surely. 

There was poor Mary with that little child when twelve thousand 
people were driven out of Missouri. Oh, that noble woman! I ate 



146 GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



dinner with her away down here, a noble woman; and when Joseph 
was called to go to the Islands, just a boy, just a little boy, only fif- 
teen years old, I said : 

"Oh, Joseph, you are going away over there across that mighty 
ocean, to a people that you don't know anything about." 

"Yes," said he, "and President Young gave me $10 in all." 

When he returned he said : "I went over there and I paid my own 
way; came back again, and then they sent me to England." 

"Why, Joseph, I can't keep track of you. You are here, and there 
and everywhere." 

God bless you, my people. God bless you noble ones, you brethren 
and sisters, and those who preside over the various quorums, and 
over the various missions of our land. May the peace of heaven rest 
upon you. I have been here in Utah a' long time. I have been in the 
bishopric here for forty-six years,labored and toiled with all of my 
might, and yet I feel sometimes I am just about forty years old ; but 
only eighty-eight years. I have had a wonderful experience in the 
earth. I am giving patriarchal blessings almost all the time. I don't 
know, I can't remember how many, but over a thousand, probably 
twelve hundred that I have given ; and yet giving blessings all the 
time ; but I want to do all that I possibly can. I wish I had the voice 
of the trumpet of the Almighty. I want to sound it to the nations of 
the earth: This is God's work! This is God's work! The great work 
of our Lord is going forth amongst the nations of the earth. It 
is wonderful, it is wonderful to me. When we look abroad and see 
what the Father has done for his Saints who came to this land, and 
when we look abroad and see where the gospel has gone all over the 
land everywhere, and see the blessings of our Father upon us — the 
beautiful homes, our children far and near by the thousands, oh, God's 
work is with us. Brethren and sisters, be faithful and true. Work, work 
on, for this is God's work; and may the peace of heaven rest upon 
you, Heber. I think that is all. God bless you. Amen. 

Choir and congregation sang "Praise God from Whom all bless- 
ings flow." 

The conference was adjourned until 2 o'clock. 
Prayer by Elder Alma Merrill. 



CLOSING SESSION 

The conference was called to order at 2 o'clock by President 
Heber J. Grant, who presided. 

The choir and congregation sang "Come, let us anew our jour- 
ney pursue." • 

Prayer was offered by Elder Lars Oveson, President of the 
Emery stake of Zion. 

Hester Davis Stevens sang a sacred solo, "One Hundred Years." 



ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN.

ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN 

(Of the First Council of Seventy and President of the California Mission) 

I have been impressed, my brethren and sisters, during this con- 
ference, in the same manner that a good brother was impressed that I 
heard make a report in one of the stakes of Zion a few years ago. He 
had just returned from Salt Lake City, where he had been in attend- 
ance at the general conference. He was one of the presidency of the 
stake where he resided, and while talking in one of the meetings of 
the stake conference he made a statement to this effect : his family 
had inquired of him on his return from Salt Lake City how he had en- 
joyed the general conference, and his answer was : "It was the best 
conference I ever attended in my life." And then he said: "The 
family smiled, and the children said: 'Why, father, we have heard 
you make that statement after every conference as long as we can re- 
member.' " He informed the congregation that he had been attend- 
ing general conference regularly for fifty-two years. I was very 
greatly impressed with his statement that after being in attendance at 
the general conferences of the Church on more than one hundred oc- 
casions he could return home and in truth say the last one attended 
"was the best conference I ever attended." A similar feeling of satis- 
faction has been in my soul during this conference. From the open- 
ing remarks that were made by President Heber J. Grant, when he pre- 
sented in so strong and inspired a manner the feelings of his soul in 
regard to the great work that God has established, I felt the Spirit of 
the Lord was present directing him and that an enjoyable time would 
be had in the conference meetings. As I have listened to the brethren 
who have occupied this position and who have borne testimony con- 
cerning the truth of the gospel, that feeling has increased in my soul. 

I praise God today, with my brethren, for the wonderful work 
that has been revealed by the Lord our God. I feel in my whole being 
that it has been established among men for the salvation of the hu- 
man family. It seems marvelous to me, my brethren and sisters, that 
I should enjoy the privilege that I enjoy here today of speaking in 
this great conference which is commemorative of the prophet's first 
vision one hundred years ago. I praise the Lord for the privilege 
of bearing testimony concerning the work of God this day. 

I have been thinking, while sitting on the stand looking at this great 
congregation, of the coming of my parents from abroad, about sixty- 
three years ago. The message of the gospel was sounded in the ears 
of my parents in a* far-off land, and they yielded obedience to the 
teachings of the servants of God a little more than sixty-five years 
ago. About sixty-three years ago they entered this valley in the same 
distressed condition that a great many other people entered the valley 
after they had passed through a very trying experience in crossing 
the plains. They landed here worn out by the long journey and in 
comparative poverty, and afterwards passed through the experiences 
common to those early pioneers who' came into this inter-mountain 
region a long time ago, when there was little of an inviting appear- 



148 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ance to be seen in this great desert valley. I thank God today that 
the principles of "Mormonism" had taken a firm hold of the affec- 
tions of my father and mother, and that to those principles they re- 
mained true through their lives, and that to their family they faith- 
fully taught the truth of the everlasting gospel, and bore unswerving 
record by word of mouth, and by example, that the work of God had 
indeed been restored to the inhabitants of the earth. To them I am 
indebted for the great privilege I this day enjoy. I believe in this 
restoration and in the necessity for the opening of the heavens, that 
the promises of holy prophets of old might be fulfilled, as has been 
declared by practically all of the speakers who have given instructions 
during this conference. 

I have here a little item that I will read that has impressed me 
upon various occasions. It was not written by one of our people; it 
was written by a convert, in fact, a priest of the Catholic Church. 
T feel sure it will be quite appropriate to read these words in this con- 
gregation. While visiting a great cathedral in Europe, I picked up 
a bumphlet many years ago at the time I was doing missionary service 
in the European mission. The booklet was entitled: "Why I am a 
Roman Catholic." The title impressed me. I thought I would like 
to know from a Roman Catholic point of view why an individual should 
be connected with the Roman Catholic Church. I had discovered from 
my own experiences, as no doubt many of you have, that when men 
who were out of the "Mormon" faith attempted to expound "Mormon- 
ism" they ofttimes presented malicious, and also grotesque ideas in 
regard to the "Mormon" faith. I have never in my life, so far as I 
remember, read from the pen of any non-"Mormon" writer a correct 
representation of the faith and doctrines of the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints. As I read the views of this priest in relation 
to his reasons for being a Roman Catholic, I was very greatly im- 
pressed with the following words : 

And again when Luther, Calvin, Henry the Eighth, and their followers, 
were starting in their mad career, either the true religion was then in 
the world or it was not. If it was, they committed grievous crimes in 
making new religions to oppose it. If it was not, they were powerless to 
create it. It takes a Christ, not a Luther, to create a Christianity. On 
either supposition, therefore, Protestantism is not the true religion of 
Jesus Christ. 

I think that is a true representation. If the religion of the Lord 
Jesus Christ was had among men in the period spoken of as the Re- 
formation, then the men that were referred to as reformers were 
guilty of grievous sin in attempting to establish new religions. This 
statement is in harmony with the word of God. It is the teaching of 
the holy Scriptures, as we can read in the epistle of the Apostle 
Paul when he wrote to the Galatians, I marvel that ye are so soon re- 
moved from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto an- 
other gospel : "which is not another ; but there be some that trouble you, 
and would pervert the gospel of Christ." The apostle then bore record' 
in the most positive and solemn manner that if they received any

other religion, or if either men or angels taught any other religion or 
doctrine than the religion that had been expounded to the people by 
the apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ, then they were to be accursed. 
So that whenever men, in any dispensation, attempt to introduce new 
religions, that differ from the gospel of the Redeemer, they are not 
doing the things that God, our Father in heaven, would have them 
do. I think we can all accept the teachings of the priest as presented 
in the words that I have read in your hearing. If the true gospel of 
the Lord Jesus Christ did not exist among men in the sixteenth cen- 
tury, it is a solemn truth that Martin Luther had no power to bring 
back the lost gospel and his fellow reformers were just as powerless. 
We have great respect for Martin Luther, and other good men among 
the reformers. I would not leave any wrong impression upon any 
mind. We believe that those reformers accomplished a splendid work 
in paving the way for that religious liberty that has come to so many 
of the children of men. But if the divine authority, the power to ad- 
minister in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ had been lost from 
among men, it is a truth that Martin Luther, no matter how good his 
motives might have been, or how good the desires of his associates, 
they were powerless to restore the authority and the religion of the 
Lord Jesus Christ. The Savior being the author of true religion 
was the only source of authority. If the plan of salvation was taken 
away from the earth, there was only one way by which it could be 
given to men again ; and that is clearly set forth in the words I 
have read to you. The Redeemer holding all power was the only being 
who could bring back to earth the lost gospel, which ever has been the 
power of God unto salvation. 

I rejoice with all my soul that at the opening of this dispensation 
the story of "Mormonism" is just as it is. Joseph Smith in the strong 
desire that was upon him to know the right path sought the Lord our 
God in humble prayer, that he might be directed aright ; and inasmuch 
as there was no man upon the earth exercising the authority of our 
Father in heaven, the story of the boy is in every way logical, when 
he declares that God himself made his appearance, with our Redeemer, 
the Lord Jesus Christ, and gave him the instructions that have been 
referred to in the discourses that have been delivered during this con- 
ference. There is no other way by which the authority that had in- 
deed been lost from among the children of men could be restored. 
Holy beings, who held this divine authority, and who had been or- 
dained to the Priesthood as mortal men, had been given the power to 
speak and act and minister in the name of the Redeemer of the world. 
These very men were sent again to earth and gave to Joseph Smith 
every key of authority they possessed. Let the world think what it 
may, and say what it will, that authority, in the manner portrayed 
in the words of Joseph Smith, was restored by the Lord our God, and 
in the restoration of authority the promises of the holy prophets have 
been fulfilled ; and the great work of the living God that was not only 
spoken of by our Father in heaven in the revelations given to the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, but that was spoken of by the ancient prophets

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



as "a marvelous work and a wonder" has indeed been established in 
this dispensation, and is the dispensation of the fulness of times. 
This work has been understood and comprehended more or less, by 
the prophets in all dispensations. It has now been revealed' according 
to the promise of the Lord God of heaven for the last time. It has 
been established by his wisdom and by his will, with the promise that 
it shall endure forever and forever, and so it shall be, as the Lord 
God Almighty lives. 

May our Father in heaven help us who are privileged today to 
assist in the establishment of that marvelous work, to be faithful, and 
steadfast, and determined, that we may bring to pass the purpose of 
God, and work out our own salvation, I humbly pray, through Jesus 
Christ, our Lord. Amen. 

ELDER HYRTJM G. SMITH 

(Presiding Patriarch of the Church) 

■ My brethren and sisters, in one respect I have not enjoyed this 
conference very much, because Lhave sat here with fear and trembling 
throughout every session of the conference. In other respects, I praise 
the Lord for his Spirit that has been with my brethren who have ad- 
dessed this conference, for I testify that their words have been di- 
rected by the Spirit of God for the strengthening of the faith of the 
Latter-day Saints and for the advancement of God's work upon the 
earth. 

I have in my heart a desire that all the faithful in Israel today 
shall be blessed of the Lord. I have in my heart a blessing for the 
Saints of God who have come to this conference and have so faith- 
fully remained in such goodly number, even to this last session, and 
I pray God to bless you, sustain you, strengthen your faith, provide 
for your necessities and help you, as my brethren and sisters in the 
faith of the Lord Jesus Christ, to carry out his purposes in the earth, 
to fulfil the wonderful work and mission which have been themes of 
this conference. 

I also desire to remind my brethren and sisters that the eyes 
of the world are upon us, upon you and upon this work, that we have 
been called upon to perform. Therefore, we should be as near to what 
we profess to be as it is possible for us to be. And although the ad- 
versary made an attempt to thwart the purposes of the Lord when 
Joseph Smith went into the woods to pray, he was overcome and 
his plan was set aside by the powers of the Father and of the Son, 
who came in glory and dispelled the agents of darkness and the very 
evil one himself. That evil influence still exists in the world, that 
battle between light and darkness is still going on. The adversary 
has not given up the fight. He is still sniping here and there and 
carrying on other plans to thwart the purposes of the Lord. In a 
revelation to the prophet, we are given counsel, advice and instruc- 
tion which, if we obey, will help us to triumph in this battle for the 
truth and for the right. 



ELDER HYRUM G. SMITH. 



151 



I read from section fifty-nine: "And that thou mayest more 
fully keep thyself unspotted from the world, thou shalt go to the 
house of prayer and offer up thy sacraments upon my holy day ; for 
verily this is a day appointed unto you to rest from your labors ; 
and to pay thy devotions unto the Most High. Nevertheless thy 
vows shall be offered up in righteousness on all days and at all times." 

Also, in section sixty-eight, further counsel and advice are given 
upon this same subject. The Lord has given a word to the parents 
who have children, directing how to care for them and to teach 
them: "For this shall be a law unto the inhabitants of Zion, or in 
any of her stakes which are organized ; and their children shall be 
baptized for the remission of their sins when eight years old, and re- 
ceive the laying on of the hands, and they shall also teach their chil- 
dren to pray and to walk uprightly before the Lord * * * 
And a commandment I give unto them, that he that observeth not 
his prayers before the Lord in the season thereof, let him be had in 
remembrance before the judge of my people." 

So, let me admonish you, my brethren and sisters, to observe 
the counsels given in these revelations, for they are the words of 
the Lord unto us today regarding this principle which will give us 
power and favor with our heavenly Father, in battling with the pow- 
ers of darkness, that we may triumph and secure the blessings pre- 
pared for the sons and daughters of God. 

Now, you may say, we do pray, we are a praying people, and 
that is true. The Latter-day Saints are a prayerful people, but we 
are admonished to pray not only for ourselves, but to pray always — 
and to pray for our enemies, also to teach our children to pray and 
to pray in season thereof, — pray night and morning, every day, in 
public and in secret. I am grateful that we have men and women 
who have been blessed with the spirit of prayer, whose hearts are 
filled with the desire to keep the counsels of the Lord. They are 
the leaders in Israel, and I admonish you, my brethren and sisters, 
to follow their counsels, because the Lord has always had leaders in 
Israel and he always will have as long as this work shall remain in the 
earth. 

I am grateful for the testimony of the Lord Jesus Christ that 
I have been blessed with, .for I feel in every fiber of my being 
that the testimony of Joseph Smith is true. I have never doubted 
from my earliest boyhood days that the story told by the Prophet 
Joseph is the absolute truth. I have always honored my birthright 
as far as I have been able to and think myself very fortunate in- 
deed to be numbered among those whom the Lord has honored with 
responsibility in his work, and for the testimony of the Lord Jesus 
Christ that has come to me, not alone through teachings but through 
diligent study and humble prayer. And never have I doubted the 
teachings of the leaders in Israel, nor my parents, concerning the 
life and mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith. I pray God to bless 
his memory and the work of the Lord which he has been the instru- 
ment in accomplishing and establishing upon the earth. 



152 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



I admonish my brethren and sisters to be more prayerful in the 
future than they have been in the past, and to be more diligent in 
teaching their children to pray, that we may triumph in the end over 
the powers of darkness, and be permitted to join in this glorious 
work with our Prophet on the other side and with all other prophets 
of God. I acknowledge the hand of the' Lord in his blessings unto 
me, and although a weak and humble instrument in his hands, I 
have observed many sacred testimonies which have come to the Lat- 
ter-day Saints through the words that have come to me as a servant 
officiating by virtue of the Holy Priesthood and by that authority, 
I bless the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and all the 
faithful members thereof, especially you, brethren and sisters, who 
have been given responsibility and leadership. My heart goes out 
to you in blessings from the Lord, because I say to you in his name 
that he is pleased with those who are true and faithful, with those 
who can stand up, as the brethren have in this conference, in the dif- 
ferent sessions thereof, and testify in boldness and in wisdom per- 
taining to the growth and truth of this work. God is at the helm. 
This is his work and not ours, although we are his agents, author- 
ized with power and with authority to carry it on. These are instru- 
ments for our guidance, and a principle of power with us and our 
children, my brethren and sisters, is prayer. May you take it home 
and cultivate it and practice it to the glory and honor of God and 
his work in the earth, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER RULON S. WELLS 

(Of the First Council of Seventy) 

The work of God is in very deed a marvelous work and a wonder. 
It began before the foundations of this earth were laid and that great 
and marvelous work is still in progress. It has to do with the sal- 
vation of our Father's children — all that ever have lived, in all the 
ages that are past and gone, and it has to do with all that now live 
and all of those yet unborn who shall yet come forth and have an 
existence upon this earth, or upon any other earth or planet; all of 
which have been made or created by tht Almighty for the express 
purpose of providing habitations for his children. "God moves in a 
mysterious way his wonders to perform." We live in the midst of 
those marvelous things and every student of history cannot review 
that which has transpired in connection with this world, without 
feeling in his whole being that God is moving in his majesty in bring- 
ing about his glorious purposes. He who created the heavens and 
the earth in the beginning, as we read in Holy Writ, did not regard 
that work as the goal of his labors. That was merely a preliminary 
toward the accomplishment of his great and glorious work, that 
marvelous work and a wonder. We read in The Pearl of Great 
Price what his great and glorious work is : "This is my work and 
my glory — to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS.

man." We heard from President Penrose that we were all the 
begotten children of God before we tabernacled in these bodies of 
flesh and bone, and ever since the coming of our first parents, 
Adam and Eve, in the Garden of Eden, this work of the Lord has 
been developing here upon the earth. Let no one think that the 
teeming millions that now inhabit the earth, even the wicked and un- 
godly, those who, through their sins, are bringing down upon them- 
selves such terrible woe and suffering; let no one think that their 
lives are all in vain, or that they have no part in the work of the 
Almighty, for they shall all be saved eventually in the consumma- 
tion of God's great work. Only those who are the sons of perdition, 
who deny the Son after the Father has revealed him, who sin against 
light and knowledge, shall be deprived of every degree of glory and 
salvation, but all the rest, even those that do wickedly, — and the 
world is full of them — now living upon this earth, after they have 
paid the penalty, even to the utmost farthing, for all the evil they 
have done, shall eventually be saved in the telestial, or the lesser, 
degree of glory, concerning which we read that it is so great that 
it surpasseth all understanding. And, therefore I say, their lives are 
not in vain, notwithstanding their wickedness. They have received 
their bodies of flesh and bone they have been schooled in 'this world 
of sorrow and sin; they shall be cast down and pay the penalty; but 
when that is done they shall be redeemed and receive a glory pre- 
pared for them, which, notwithstanding they may never come where 
God and his Christ dwell, yet nevertheless is so great that it sur- 
passeth all understanding. The opportunities for an exaltation in 
the presence of God, have been given by our Father in his mercy and 
goodness and offered to all those that would yield obedience t£ 
his gospel, and how grateful we ought to be for that. If the wicked 
are to receive such glory what then will be the glory of the faith- 
ful? 

We have been listening to the narration of a most wonderful 
event — the appearance of the Father and the Son to the boy prophet, 
Joseph Smith. Indeed, it is wonderful, and so have the events that 
have transpired in other dispensations of God's providence been 
wonderful. Think of the wonderful ministry of our Redeemer. One 
great American statesman when asked: "How can you believe in the 
divinity of Christ and in the miracles he wrought?" answered, "I 
find it much more difficult not to believe in them." 

I believe in the vision that was given to the prophet, Joseph Smith. 
I have always believed it all my life. I find it more difficult not to 
believe it. The evidences are so complete that not one shadow of 
a doubt remains with me as to the truth of that great and glorious 
event. Let no one confuse in their minds the two words "credulity" 
and "faith." They do not resemble each other. Credulity is a weak- 
ness ; faith is strength. Credulity is founded frequently upon false 
testimony, but faith is unfailing. Faith is listening to the whisper- 
ings of God unto our souls, and he that resists faith is fighting 
against God, and without faith it is impossible to please him, but 



154 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



with faith we can accept the truth, for the Lord manifests it by his 
unfailing and unerring- Spirit that bears witness of the truth. 

"There is a spirit in man, and the inspiration of the Almighty 
giveth him understanding." The Lord did not leave us alone or in 
darkness when he placed us here on earth. He opened a channel of 
communication that we might receive the truth direct from him. 
Faith then is the gift of God — the assurance which we receive from 
him of all that is true ; it is listening to the still small voice of God. 
Then through our faith, which is the natural impulse, he has placed 
in every human heart, God is striving to bring us back into his pres- 
ence, and will continue so to strive until we, shut him out by refusing 
to hearken to his voice, and, giving a more willing ear to the voice 
of the adversary of our souls, we fall into the ways of wickedness and 
sin. Both God and his arch enemy are striving with each and 
everyone of us. Let us have faith in God and hearken unto him and 
reject the. counsel of the adversary. What will faith avail us? Abso- 
lutely nothing unless it is united with the works of obedience to his 
divine will. 

Before me is a vast congregation of men and women, who be- 
lieve in the divinity of the call that came to the prophet, Joseph 
Smith; — the inspiration of the Almighty has given to their souls an 
understanding of the truth of this marvelous work in which we^are 
now engaged. Their very presence here is a manifestation of that 
faith. I find still further evidences of that faith in the sacrifices 
that our people have made and are making, in carrying the gospel 
message to the world in the free giving of their time and means; in 
their devoted and unselfish labors both at home and abroad; in the 
payment of their tithes and offerings ; in the building of temples and 
the performance of holy ordinances therein for the living and the 
dead, and in the erection of houses of worship and school buildings 
for the education and development and enlightenment of the people 
both young and old. 

Here then is a manifestation of a living faith in God ; in the glo- 
rious vision which he gave to Joseph and in the marvelous work which 
he has inaugurated through the instrumentality of this Latter-day 
Prophet, whom he raised up to usher in this great and glorious dis- 
pensation of his providence — the dispensation of the fulness of times. 
The way to exaltation in the presence of God, then, is through faith, 
combined with the works of obedience to his divine will. He desires 
that we shall live by faith. The time will come when all shall know 
him, even from the greatest to the least — when every knee shall bow 
and -every tongue confess that Jesus is the Christ. Some will be 
converted by outward evidences. The Savior said to Thomas, who 
would not believe without seeing the print of the nails and the wound 
in his side, — "Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast be- 
lieved; blessed are they that have not seen and yet have believed." 
Some are blinded by their prejudices and by the sophistries and false 
philosophies of men; and men and women who have been thus de- 
ceived, not through any fault of the Lord, but because they failed 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS. 



155 



to hearken to the voice of the ever-striving Spirit of God, or, in 
other words because they had not faith, which means simply they 
were not living in communication with the Lord, which is the priv- 
ilege of every child of God, and not to thus live and hearken to the 
whisperings of his voice is resisting his efforts to bring us back to 
him.. Then let us live by faith and couple that faith with the works 
of obedience ; have faith in God and put your trust in him. Have 
faith in his servants and hearken to their counsel. 

With all my soul I believe in the restoration of the gospel of the 
Lord Jesus Christ through the instrumentality of the prophet, Joseph 
Smith. I know that it is the power of God unto salvation and if we 
live in accordance with its teachings we shall receive God's greatest 
gift unto his children — Eternal Life in his presence, which is the 
greatest glory and promise, and is made only to those who are valiant 
for the truth, who live by faith and reject not the counsels of God ; a 
glory which the wicked and ungodly shall not attain ; a glory far 
superior to the terrestrial glory, which shall come to the many hon- 
orable men and women of the earth, who have been blinded by their 
prejudioes and sophistries and vain philosophies of men ; a glory that 
is to be enjoyed exclusively by those who live by faith, who hearken 
to the voice of God and render obedience to his divine will, even the 
celestial glory, the highest of all. All the Father hath he giveth 
unto such. 

May we all attain unto this glory, I pray in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

ELDER SEYMOUR B. YOUNG 

(Senior President of the Council of Seventy) 

My brethren and sisters, I have been impressed during this con- 
ference with the weight of testimony that has been given by those 
who have addressed us in regard to the divine mission of the Savior 
of the World and also of the mission, the sacred mission, of the prophet 
Joseph Smith. 

In his autobiography we read: "As we were translating from 
the plates, we came across the sentence in relation to baptism for the 
remission of sins, and so impressed were we with this sacred principle 
we immediately repaired to a secret place and prayed unto the Lord 
concerning the administration of baptism for the remission of sins." 

And when searching the record of the Book of Mormon I felt 
impressed to seek for the evidence that is there produced, in regard 
to the ordinance of baptism. In the eleventh chapter of 3rd Nephi I 
found the full direction and explanation of this beautiful subject. 
The few Nephites who were gathered around the temple were 
conversing together in regard to the changes of nature that had 
been produced by the upheavals of the earth during the crucifixion of 
our Savior. And then, as they were conversing and comparing the 
events that had recently transpired, impressed as they were that the 



156 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



time of his crucifixion had passed, that the time of his rest in the 
tomb had passed, and that he had been resurrected, they all at once 
heard a voice, and at first they did not understand what was said. 
And a second time they heard the voice, and then the third time they 
looked up into heaven from whence the voice proceeded and they saw 
a man descending from on high, clothed in a pure white robe. And 
the Savior came and stood in their midst, and he called upon Nephi, 
so the record says, and Nephi stood before him and the Savior gave 
him the commission to baptize in his name, to immerse in the waters 
of baptism and so impressed was Nephi with this great power and 
with the condescension of the Savior to him that he fell down before 
the Lord and kissed his feet. Others were also appointed to minister 
in this scared ordinance, so the record proclaims. You are well 
aware, my brethren and sisters, of the history. 

In answer to the prayer made by the Prophet Joseph, at this 
time, came John the Baptist, the forerunner of the Christ, the great 
prophet that had the privilege of ministering baptism to our Lord ; 
and he conferred upon Joseph and Oliver, the Aaronic Priesthood, 
which gave them the power to teach and minister in the principles of 
the gospel, and to baptize for the remission of sins. 

In the first chapter of 3rd Nephi we have a very direct ac- 
count of the evidence of the birth of the Savior. The Lamanite 
prophet, Samuel, predicted that the time would come when there 
would be a witness of the birth of the Savior^manifested upon this 
land, manifested to the Nephites and to the Lamanites ; and it is re- 
corded that those who were members of the Church were in the 
minority to that degree that their enemies proclaimed to them that 
if the sign that was predicted by Samuel, the Lamanite prophet, was 
not immediately fulfilled that all those who believed in this prediction 
should be put to death. Nephi went out into a secret place and pleaded 
with the Lord to know if this sign would be given of the coming of 
the Savior, that at his birth there should be a day and a night and 
another day without any darkness between the two days. As Nephi 
was praying to the Lord with all his heart, bowed in sorrow because 
of the distress and the destruction that was threatened to come upon 
his people, the Lord whispered to him: "Lift up your head and re- 
joice; be of good cheer, for this very night shall the sign be given, 
and tomorrow come I into the world." So the history continues, 
that very night the sun went down as usual, but no darkness followed, 
and when the sun arose again in the morning there had been no dark- 
ness upon the face of the land. Then the believers and the faithful 
Church members knew that Christ was born. Then the enemies that 
had threatened their destruction knew that they were thwarted in 
their designs and they became frightened and were inspired with the 
feeling of fear and the desire to make peace with those who had been 
faithful. Many of them repented of their sins and were added to 
the Church, so says the record. 

In the Mutual Improvement Association of the Church they have 
adopted a slogan for this year. That slogan is: "We stand for spirit- 



ELDER SEYMOUR B. YOUNG. 



157 



ual growth through attendance at sacrament meetings," and the 
members endeavor to induce others to do so with all the ability that 
they possess. In the eighteenth chapter of 3rd Nephi, this same glo- 
rious record that I have alluded to before, we find that the Savior 
visited the Church and instructed the people how to officiate in the 
sacred ordinances of ministering the Lord's Supper. It is recorded 
that he said to his disciples : "Bring bread and wine." And while 
they were gone for the bread and the wine he called to the people and 
bade them to sit down in groups upon the earth, and when the bread 
and the wine came he took the bread, blessed and brake, and gave to 
his disciples and said to them : Eat of this in memory of me, and 
inasmuch as ye shall do this and remember me and the offering that 
I have made, you shall have my spirit always to be with you. And 
when they had partaken he commanded them to give to the multitude. 
And then he took the wine and blessed it and when the disciples had 
partaken he commanded them to give to the multitude, and he said : 
"As often as ye shall do this in memory of my blood which was shed 
for you, you shall have my spirit to be with you." 

My brethren and sisters, I am glad that I am present at this 
splendid conference. I have listened to some of the greatest testi- 
monies during the sessions that have been held. I have listened to 
inspired men who have spoken as they were moved upon by the Holy 
Ghost, in testimony of the divinity of this great work, in testimony 
of that great man who, as a little boy, went before the Lord in hum- 
ble prayer and asked that he might know which was the true Church, 
for he was impressed with the desire to be a member of that Church, 
and you know the answer that came to him. It has been rehearsed 
here during this conference, and you know the condescension of our 
Father and of his Son Jesus Christ, when they appeared to the boy 
and gave him the necessary information, and answer to his question. 
The same spirit inspired the Prophet Joseph when he wanted to 
know of his standing before the Lord, three years after his first 
vision, and again he prayed to the Father that he might know and 
the Lord sent his messenger again. The Nephite prophet this time 
came and visited and gave him a high commission. Then, at the 
time that he wanted to know in regard to the principle of baptism for 
the remission of sins for the third time he went before the Lord. He 
went to that unfailing source of intelligence and inspiration, and he did 
not appeal in vain, and the Lord, according to the record, sent his 
messenger to give him the desired answer and information. 

And when he was in prison in Liberty jail, Clay county, Missouri, 
he again sought the Lord in fervent prayer, beseeching him with all 
the anguish and sorrow of his soul : 

"Oh God! where art thou? And where is the pavilion that covereth 
thy hiding place?" 

"Oh Lord God Almighty, Maker of the heaven and earth, * * * stretch 
forth thy hand; * * * let thy hiding place no longer be covered; let 
thine ear be inclined; let thine heart be softened * * * toward us." 

"Remember thy suffering Saints, O our God \ and thy servants will 
rejoice in thy name forever." 



158 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



"My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions 
shall be but a small moment." 

"And then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high. * * * 

"Cursed are all those that shall lift up the heel against mine anointed, 
saith the Lord, * * * they are the servants of sin, and are the children 
of disobedience themselves." * * * 

"Let thy bowels also be full of charity towards all men, and to the 
household of faith, and let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly, then 
shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God, and the doctrine 
of the Priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as the dews from heaven." 

"The Holy Ghost shall be thy constant campanion, and thy sceptre 
an unchanging sceptre of righteousness and truth, and thy dominion shall 
be an everlasting dominion, and without compulsory means, it shall flow 
unto thee forever and ever." 

I testify to you that Joseph Smith was and is a Prophet of God, 
that Jesus Christ is the Savior of the World, that his Church is on 
the earth today and that this people are led by a prophet of God, I 
give you this testimony with all my heart and soul, in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 



. ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS 

(Of the First Council of Seventy) 

(Owing to the unavodiable absence of Elder Roberts from the Confer- 
ence on Monday and Tuesday, he was not given an opportunity to speak; 
hence, on request of President Heber J. Grant, this address, given at an- 
other meeting, during the Conference, is here presented) : 

I wish to say, my brethren, that I appreciate, beyond any power 
of mine to express it, the opportunity afforded me to say just a word 
to you at the invitation of President Grant. You may be assured that 
my absence through two days from the General Conference was un- 
avoidable. 

THE MORMON BATTALION MONUMENT. 

There is one matter that I think I ought to mention here — and 
I do so with very great pleasure — and that is, you will remember that 
at a similar "meeting to this, six months ago, I was granted the privi- 
lege of presenting the matter of making a drive to raise the funds for 
the Mormon Battalion Monument. The State had appropriated $100,- 
000 provided the commission raise $100,000 from other sources. With 
the consent of President Grant, I presented the matter six months 
ago. You doubtless remember the very fine spirit in which that sub- 
ject was received by you, and what a very hearty response it met with. 
Well, I now have to say to you that in December the State Com- 
mission made the necessary organization throughout the counties of 
Utah, and throughout the stakes of Zion, outside of the counties of 
Utah, but we have been conducting this campaign for funds under 
very discouraging circumstances. We began right in the midst of the 
holiday season, and shortly after in very many of the communities the 
"flu" broke out and hindered our work. In addition to that, it seemed 



ELDER B. H. ROBERTS.

to me that never before were the people called upon to meet so many 
demands made upon their generosity, as at that time. "Drives," four 
and five deep, followed upon ours but' notwithstanding all these dis- 
advantages, through the very excellent response from the stakes of 
Zion, I, can say to you that the amount that is now in the banks, and 
that which has been reported to us, as being in hand, but not yet sent 
up to our treasurer, — the account being kept open in the hope that 
further additions will be made, — satisfied us that we now have con- 
tributed, of this $100,000, from seventy to seventy-five thousand dol- 
lars ; and I have not a doubt but that we shall be able to make such ap- 
peal to those who have not yet responded — as we think, to the fulness 
of their generosity — that will easily make up the remainder of that sum, 
and that it will be deposited with the State treasurer in time to make 
available the State's appropriation for the monument. 

I thought it was only fitting to make this report to you since you 
took so splendid a part, and responded to the appeal with such spon- 
taneity, that you ought to know the progress we have made. We are 
now so near to the top of the hill, that I am very sure we shall reach 
the summit of it splendidly, and, in due time, we shall be able to com- 
memorate one of the greatest historical events connected with our 
pioneer history, and establish a monument of it for all future gen- 
erations. 

TESTIMONY. 

Now, in relation to my joining the rest of the brethren in testi- 
mony concerning God's great latter-day work, mentioned by President 
Grant. Here, if anywhere, I feel entirely at home ; and I experience 
the thrill that comes from a consciousness of being, with you, one of 
the sons of God. With all my heart and soul I thank God, the eternal 
Father, that he has given to me a sure testimony of his existence, his 
being, and the kind of being he is. For to me he stands revealed through 
Jesus Christ, our Lord ; the Christ, resurrected and immortal, is the 
exact image and likeness of the Father's person; that as the Son is, 
so also is the Father; and that united with them and bearing witness 
to the children of men of their existence, is that personage of the 
Holy Ghost, a personage of spirit, with whom we may have fellow- 
ship, into whose fellowship we have been inducted by the holy ordi- 
nance of confirmation, the laying on of hands, by which we have 
access unto him and the light and intelligence and power and glory 
that emanate from him; and from the Father, and from the Son, and 
from the Holy Ghost. Thereby proceeds forth from these, to fill the 
immensity of space, the Spirit of the living God, in whom we may live 
and move and have our being. As we live and move and have our 
being on a summer day in the glorious sunshine, so in the everywhere 
presence of God about us, our souls may be in touch and in harmony, 
in union and fellowship with the Holy Trinity, through fellowship 
with the Holy Ghost. 

I rejoice in those great and fundamental truths, and I thank God 
that he has given me a knowledge of these great doctrines, and the

truth of the whole gospel of Jesus Christ, including a knowledge of 
the truth of the blessed atonement, by which the mercy of God 
is introduced into the economy of God with reference to the human 
race, making forgiveness of sin possible, and man's fellowship with 
God a reality through the ordinances of the gospel. I know that these 
things are true, for God has given me the witness of them. Looking 
back over my life, I may say to you, though I may at times and in 
part have wandered from God, that is, I may have displeased him 
by the manifestation of my human weakness and imperfections, yet 
God in his mercy has never left me; and I can speak of and rejoice 
in the fellowship of God today, and in the clearness of the knowledge 
of God and of these great doctrines of the gospel, I have referred to, 
with all my soul. I know that God lives ; that Jesus is the Christ ; 
that the gospel is true ; that his Church is established, no more to be 
destroyed; that the elements of preservation and continuity are in 
it, and will continue, and it will enlarge; it will grow stronger; its 
foundations are laid broad and deep, and it will remain in the earth 
to function for God in the work of salvation for the children of 
men, its glory increasing, its power enlarging, until it shall deliver 
such a message to this world for God, that it will lead to the re- 
demption of the human race. In these things, my brethren, I rejoice 
with you, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 

(Of the First Council of Seventy) 

University of Utah, April 6, 1920 

President Heber J. Grant, 
Salt Lake City. 

My dear President Grant: — I have been called this morning to 
attend an important meeting of the Board of the State Industrial 
School at Ogden. I am compelled, therefore, to ask to be excused 
from the sessions of the conference today. I regret this very much, 
for I was anxious to attend the meetings, particularly on this sixth 
day of April. 

The general theme of this conference has been a spiritual uplift 
to me. As the days and years add to my little knowledge of life, the 
beauty of the gospel of Jesus Christ grows. The vision of God the 
Father and the Son Jesus Christ to the boy Joseph Smith in the spring 
of 1820 is the one event that has ushered in a new period of the 
world's history. Ancient days were then left behind, and modern 
days began. It was the most natural thing in the world for God to 
reveal himself to a child whose mind was pure and who had not 
learned the theories of philosophy of that day. I look upon Joseph 
Smith as the greatest prophet of all history, for his was the work of 
the greatest age of man's development since the fall of Adam. 

May we all go forward with the testimony ringing in our hearts 
that Jesus Christ is the Redeemer of the world; that Joseph Smith 
is a prophet of God; that the Priesthood of God has been restored; 
that the Book of Mormon is a record of the fathers of the American

Indian preserved to us for this age by the power of God ; and that 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has been established 
by the divine power of the Lord. 

May we turn to the glorious doctrines of the resurrection, and 
give our hearts to God, that he may give us life everlasting. May 
we each day have God's holy blessing, to perform the duties of the 
hour. As we stand before the ever-increasing responsibilities of life, 
may God make us humble before them. May we all seek in our 
hearts and minds the Divine Guidance, that we may learn the path 
of larger service and wider usefulness. May we serve the Master 
by serving his children. 

I trust, President Grant, that the day may be happy for you and 
for all assembled in divine worship. My heart is ever with you in the 
work of the Lord. 

Sincerely your brother, 

Levi Edgar Young. 
PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

Announced that there were 20 minutes of time left and that he 
desired to hear from four brethren of the authorities who had not yet 
spoken at the conference : 

ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 

(Of the Presiding Bishopric of the Church) 
I thought while our Patriarch was talking that he had one ad- 
vantage over me, in that this was not the first time he has been 
called upon to face such a congregation. Sunday, President Penrose 
stated that he approached the task of speaking with grave concern. I 
tried to imagine what my feelings would be if I should be called upon 
to occupy this position. I can now assure you that my imagination 
paints a very poor picture. 

I rejoice, my brethren and sisters, in the opportunity I have had 
of attending this conference and of hearing the testimonies that have 
been borne to us, and I bear witness to you, this day, that I approve 
of all that has been said, that in my heart it finds a lodging place. It 
is not difficult for me to know in my soul that Joseph Smith did, 
in very deed, see the Father and the Son. It is not difficult for me to 
understand that he did, under the hands of Peter, James and John, 
receive the holy Priesthood. You might say, How do you know? 
I find an answer to that when I am called upon to act under the 
authority of the Priesthood which has been conferred upon me, and I 
lay my hands upon the heads of the sick and bless them by that au- 
thority, commanding disease to depart and health to be restored, and 
I see the blessing almost instantly fulfilled. I then know whence 
that power comes, for I have no right in and of myself to cast out 
disease. When I exercise the right which has come to me through the 
Priesthood to act for God, who acknowledges that right, it is not dif- 
ficult for me to understand these things. 

Some time ago we had a brother come from the islands, away

down in the South Sea. I had the pleasure of taking him through 
the hospital. I started at the boiler room. He was very much in- 
terested in the mechanical workings of the institution. I showed 
him the placing of coal in the fire box, the turning of the water into 
the boiler, the creating of steam through contact with the heat and 
water. I explained to him how the steam, going through a dynamo, 
produced electricity, which was carried into the building on wires. He 
could not understand how that could be, so I tried :to explain further. 
I showed him as we approached the operating room the cotter iron, 
how it became red hot when the electricity was turned on. I showed 
him the electric light; the operation of the elevator, and many other 
things for which electricity is being used. We finally ended with the 
ioe machine. I drew my hand along one of the pipes and scraped 
off some snow. As I put it into his hand, he looked at me and 
said, "Take me away quick, you are driving me crazy." He quit ; he 
was unwilling to investigate further. Had he studied diligently and 
faithfully 'he could have known for himself how these things were 
done. 

I know, my brethren and sisters, that this is the work of the 
Lord. I know that the men who have been chosen as leaders in Israel 
are men of God, that they have authority to act for him, here on 
earth, and that they do so act under his guidance and his direction. 
I bear testimony to you that I have faith in this work. I have faith 
in the gospel, and I know that just so far as I am faithful and dili- 
gent, exerting myself to keep him commandments, I will be given 
strength and ability to overcome evil. 

May God bless us, my brethren and sisters. May we be faithful 
in this work, is my prayer and I ask it in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

ELDER JOHN WELLS 

(Of the Presiding Bishopric of the Church) 

My brethren and sisters, I thank the Lord that he has given 
me a testimony and a knowledge of the truth of the gospel. During 
this conference my heart has been thrilled with the testimonies that 
have been borne by my brethren. The story of the first vision of 
the Prophet, of the visit of the Father and the Son to him, never tires 
me. I love to hear it, I love to muse about it . To me it is as 
sweet as the story of the birth of Jesus Christ. When my brethren 
testify to these great truths, my soul is filled with gladness because 
the Lord has given me a testimony like unto those that I have listened 
to. When we listen to those who testify to the divine mission of 
the Prophet Joseph Smith and the truth of the gospel of Jesus 
Christ, no matter how humble their walks of life may be, if we are 
attuned to the same spirit, our souls are full of gladness because of 
their testimonies. This is the reason that when we leave conference 
we always say that this has been the best conference we have ever had. 



ELDER JOHN WELLS 



166 



I thank my heavenly Father that I belong to a Church that 
has placed upon me the duty of working out my own salvation ; 
where I can labor in the cause of the Master; where 1 can be one of 
the ministry, serving him and assisting to bring about his purposes 
on the earth. 

I am glad to say to you that the Lord has given me an assurance 
beyond doubt that this great latter day work is his work. He gave 
me a testimony of the divinity of the Book of Mormon before I be- 
came a member of the Church. I remember in my younger days, 
reading that passage on the last page but one, of that wonderful rec- 
ord which the Lord has given to us, known as the Book of Mormon. 
In this passage he told his servant that those who would read it in 
faith with prayerful hearts if they would ask the Lord if it was 
true, it should be manifested unto them. I need no arguments, nor 
philosophy, nor opinions to convince me of the truth of the Book of 
Mormon. The bringing forth of this book was one of the great 
works of the boy prophet, Joseph Smith, which was brought forth to 
the world before he was twenty-four years of age. It has stood the 
test of critics, historians, and our opponents for all these years. It 
was translated not by any power of Joseph Smith; he didn't claim 
that, but rather through the power and inspiration of the Lord, and 
I hope my brethren and sisters will return to the habit of reading 
the word of God because this book, the Book of Mormon, contains the 
fulness of the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. 

May the Lord bless us that we may go home with renewed faith, 
may our tithes and offerings to the Lord increase. If we want to see 
temples dotting this land of Zion, this choice land above all other 
lands, let us remember that it can be done by the payment of our 
tithes and offerings. If we want beautiful houses of worship, let us 
pay our tithes and offerings. If we want to be content in this 
land that it shall be a land of Zion unto us, let us pay our tithes and 
offerings. The Lord has said to his servant, the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, that, "If my people observe not this law to keep it holy, and by 
this law sanctify the land of Zion unto me, that my statutes and 
my judgments may be kept thereon, that it may be most holy, behold, 
verily I say unto you it shall not be a land of Zion unto you." Zion to 
a Latter-day Saint means peace and contentment. 

May we go home with a spirit of the work of God in our hearts, 
and with a desire to do better in the future to bring about his mighty 
purposes in the earth, I ask it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, 
our Redeemer. Amen. 

ELDER SAMUEL O. BENNION 

(President of the Central States Mission) 

I feel, my brethren and sisters, that I have never attended a con- 
ference where more men have borne testimony to the divine mission of 
the Prophet Joseph Smith and the work of the Lord than at this 
conference. I appreciate the privilege that the Lord has granted me 



164 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



in being present at this time. I know that God lives and that Jesus 
is the Christ and that Joseph Smith was and is a prophet of God. I 
know that those mighty men who followed him — Brigham Young, 
John Taylor, Wilford Woodruff, Lorenzo Snow, Joseph F. Smith, 
have been, and that Heber J. Grant is now divinely appointed to lead 
Israel in these the last days and that the power of the Lord has rested 
upon them as leaders in Israel ; that God our eternal Father will 
never forsake his people; that he will continue to be with those men 
and women who honor him and keep his commandments. If they 
serve him, he will give everyone an individual testimony that they 
may know that he does live, that he is present among the children 
of men wherever his Priesthood can be found. I positively know that 
the Lord revealed his Priesthood in these the last days. I know that 
the words he spoke unto the bishop of this Church, Bishop Partridge, 
when he was called to the ministry, are true : 

Thus saith the Lord God, the Mighty One of Israel, Behold, I say 
unto you, my servant Edward, that you are blessed, and your sins are 
forgiven you, and you are called to preach my gospel as with the voice of 
a trump; 

And I will lay my hand upon you by the hand of my servant Sidney 
Rigdon, and you shall receive my Spirit, the Holy Ghost, even the com- 
forter, which shall teach you the peaceable things of the kingdom (Doc. 
and Cov. 36:1, 2). 

Lie laid his hands upon Bishop Partridge by the hands of his 
servant Sidney Rigdon, and that is the order in this Church ; when 
men are appointed and called and chosen to act in the name of God, 
whether they be serving as the elder who travels abroad or the high 
priest at home, Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God, calls and or- 
dains them by his own personal supervision, as he has organized 
his Church here in the earth. I pray God to bless each and every 
one that we may have the power and spirit and desire to serve him and 
that we may pray in our homes, and pray individually, that we may 
know, ourselves, that God lives, and that he rules and reigns in the 
heavens above and in the earth beneath. I ask it in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

ELDER WINSLOW FARR SMITH 

(President of the Northwestern States Mission) 

In the 15th Chapter of I Samuel we read: "Hath the Lord 
as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the 
voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to 
hearken than the fat of rams." It is in pursuit of my calling as a min- 
ister of the gospel, as a missionary in the Church of Jesus Christ, that 
I stand here in obedience to the call that has come, to bear my 
testimony. 

To me there is nothing in life comparable with the feeling, the 
faith, the knowledge that the gospel of Jesus Christ is true. To feel 
and know without a doubt that one hundred years ago this spring 



ELDER WIN SLOW FARR SMITH 



165 



God in his mercy to his children opened the heavens and permitted 
the great truth of his personality and the truths of his gospel, his plan 
of salvation, to be made known to the children of men, is a real bless- 
ing. To me the joy of working and preaching that gospel in the world 
is beyond anything earth offers. The joy, the satisfaction, the great 
pleasure of being a missionary, a bearer of his word to the peoples 
of the world, to know the responsibility of working with the young 
men and the young women of Zion in preaching this great gospel mes- 
sage is a rare privilege. 

I say, my brethren and sisters, to obey is better than sacrifice. It 
is the obeying of the call, not the sacrifice that is made, that makes 
these men and these women mighty. When God gives a command, 
that command has a purpose. I read in the holy scriptures that, 
"Though be were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which 
he suffered, and, being made perfect, he became the Author of eternal 
salvation unto all them that obey him." 

The gospel of Jesus Christ is the biggest thing in the world today. 
A testimony of that gospel is the most precious possession that a 
human soul can have. To stand up and bear that testimony is the 
greatest privilege that comes to any Latter-day Saint. Unto you, my 
brethren and sisters, unto every member of this Church and especially 
to those who have been specifically designated to be missionaries 
is the great responsibility of declaring to the world that God has 
spoken from the heavens in these the last days. There is nothing 
under heaven to compare with it. What is wealth, what is position, 
what is influence, if in gaining these things you jeopardize your place 
with God? I say, unto you, my brethren and sisters, is this respon- 
sibility given. 

The command has come to you. You must obey, there is no other 
way under heaven whereby you can be saved. There is no other 
name under heaven whereby you may obtain salvation. Knowing 
this to be a fact, and being spurred on by the testimonies that have 
been borne during this conference, dare you stand back, dare you let 
the adversary conquer you, dare you let pass any opportunity to de- 
clare that God has spoken from the heavens in these the last days? 
I declare to you as a servant of the Lord, as a missionary in his great 
cause, that nothing that you will ever possess will give you the satis- 
faction of retaining, by righteous living, by obedience to his law, by 
obedience and respect to the Priesthood, that testimony which has 
been given you, and which has been greatly strengthened during this 
conference. God bless you. Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

The Government of the United States is endeavoring to the very 
best of its ability to encourage the people to be thrifty and to save. It 
is trying to overcome the wave of extravagance that at present 
seems to be sweeping over the country, notwithstanding the high 
cost of living. 



166 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



IN THE INTEREST OF ECONOMY, NO LARGE PARTY WILL BE TAKEN TO 

THE SACRED GROVE. 

We desire to announce that the Church authorities are in full ac- 
cord with this campaign of the Government in favor of thrift. In 
view of the present conditions and of the marvelous and wonderful 
rendition of the "Vision" last night in this building, the cantata by 
Professor Evan Stephens, it has been deemed wise — in view of the 
immense amount that it would cost to carry a large number of people, 
probably a thousand, judging from the many applications that have 
come to us — not to take a large party to the Sacred Grove. We feel 
it would be an expense that ought to be avoided ; and therefore only 
a small company, if any company at all, will visit that sacred spot. 

We had here" last night the most magnificent audience that has 
ever been in this building for any entertainment of any kind or de- 
scription. The receipts were larger, although the admission was only 
50c, than when we have had the world-renowned artists of the country 
here, charging $2 and $3 admission. Hundreds, yes more than a 
thousand, I am sure, were turned away last evening. 

THE "VISION," BY STEPHENS, TO BE REPEATED IN JUNE. 

We expect to repeat "The Vision" again during the June confer- 
ence, and to make that occasion as memorable as this conference. We 
believe that more good will come from this conference and from the 
June conference than by having an excursion to the Sacred Grove.

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I want to indorse with all my heart the very wonderful testi- 
monies that have been borne here. I want to say that there has been 
a response in my heart to these marvelous testimonies. I want to pay 
my tribute of respect to the splendid audience that was here last night 
and to the wonderful rendition of the "Vision" by the choir. I desire 
to thank Professor Stephens and each and every one of those who 
took part in that very remarkable rendition, and to pray God to bless 
them and inspire them, that when it is repeated the same wonderful 
spirit may be with them. I am grateful for the splendid speech that 
was made here last night upon the "Vision," brief, but to the point, 
by Elder Melvin J. Ballard. I pray that the spirit and inspiration 
of the living God may accompany each and every one of the Latter- 
day Saints to their homes. It is the spirit that giveth life. I re-

ioiced in listening to the testimony of our Patriarch whose great 
grandfather was the father of the Prophet Joseph Smith and of the 
Patriarch Hyrum Smith, who lost their lives as a testimony for the 
divinity of this work. 

My heart was filled when I thought of the missionary labors 
time and time again of John Henry Smith, as I listened to the wonder- 
ful five-minute testimony of his son. They say that "Mormonism" 
is dying out in the second and the third generations; but "Mor- 
monism" is progressing and growing day by day, year by year. This 
is no mushroom growth but it is the growth of the sturdy oak. We 
have in very deed the truth. God lives; Jesus is the Christ, Joseph 
Smith was a prophet of God and he is a prophet of God. He stands at 
the head of this dispensation. He did see God, he did receive a 
message from the Redeemer of the world. We have the truth. May 
God help us to live it, I ask in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

We will now sing the hymn, "O My Father." The great majority 
of this audience I am afraid are not acquainted with the old English 
tune, by which tune Aunt Eliza R. Snow said she loved to hear her 
hymn sung, better than any other. The choir will lead us in singing 
the hymn by that tune. 

I was once asked by Professor John J. McClellan, "Why did you 
learn 'O My Father' by the old tune instead of the Moody and 
Sankey tune?" I said: "Because it is all wool and a yard wide and 
the other is shoddy." He said : "Had you been a musician, you could 
not have made a better criticism." 

The choir and congregation sang, "O my Father," to the old 

tune. 

Conference was adjourned for six months. 

Benediction was pronounced by Elder Bryant S. Hinckley of 
the Liberty Stake of Zion. 



Professor Anthony C. Lund, conducted the singing in the Taber- 
nacle. Professor John J. McClellan played the accompaniments, 
interludes, etc., on the great organ, assisted by Edward P. Kimball 
and Tracy Y. Cannon. 

The stenographic reports of the discourses in the Tabernacle 
were taken by Elder Franklin W. Otterstrom, assisted by Clyde Ras- 
mussen ; in the Assembly Hall and the Bureau of Information by 
Elder Frederick E. Barker, and Fred G. Barker.

AVE you ever stopped to think how much time 
^ * we spend in planning what we shall put on 
(^ and what we shall put in our children's bodies 

|Qr and how little in planning what we shall put 

in their minds? They go to school, to be sure, 




but that is for only five hours a day for approximately 185 
days a year. What of the years before they begin to go to 
school, what of the hours and days each year in which they 
are not under instruction? Have wei any deliberate plans 
to care for the mind's growth as we care for the body's? 

It is just as important that children shall read good" 
books as it is that they shall learn to read at all. It would 
be hard to find any one who would declare that it is un- 
necessary for children to learn to read. Yet reading in it- 
self is not the end we seek, but only a means to the end. 
The goal of all education is the enrichment of life, and a 
child's reading carefully guided will deepen and strengthen 
his future ability to make the most of himself and his op- 
portunities. 

To really love books so that they may be woven into 
the warp and woof of his life a child should have his own 
individual library, which grows year by year with his 
growth, yet which contains friends to whom he will return 
time and time again, secure in the knowledge of a happy 
companionship, full of pleasant associations. A large num- 
ber of books is not esesntial to have, but a few should be 
added each year and the standard of choice should be kept 
high. — Seattle Public Library Bulletin.

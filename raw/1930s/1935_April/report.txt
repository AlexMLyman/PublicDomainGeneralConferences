A THRILLING STORY 

of Century One of 

CHURCH HISTORY 

ERE is a new story of "Mormonism," told with a com- 
pleteness and charm that will thrill Latter-day Saints 
with a pride of achievement and at the same time 
win the admiration of the critic, be he friend or foe. In a 
COMPREHENSIVE HISTORY OF THE CHURCH, B. H. 
Roberts has done a masterful piece of research and has set 
down the record of Century One — 1830 to 1930 — in a bril- 
liant appraisal of momentous events. The reader with a 
sentimental interest will be fascinated with this narrative 
of truth stranger than fiction; the reader who approaches 
the new work with the critical vision of the historian will 
find it fair in statement, authentic in fact, copious in detail 
and sound in judgment. 

A COMPREHENSIVE HISTORY OF THE CHURCH was 
written by Elder Roberts at the instance of the First Presi- 
dency of the Church, with a commission to make it exhaus- 
tively complete, from the remotest beginnings to the close 
of the Centennial Conference of April 6, 1930. The final 
volume ends with an account of the Conference itself, mak- 
ing the history technically inclusive of all that happened in 
Century One of the organized existence of the Church. Thus 
it is a fitting commemoration of one hundred years of strug- 
gle and achievement. 

This monumental work is not to be confused with any former 
history, journal or chronicle. Though its nucleus is the his- 
tory of "Mormonism" published a few years ago in 
AMERICANA, running serially for six years through that 
magazine, yet this History is NEW — new in its wealth of 
material, new in method of treatment and new in its physical 
representation of the book maker's art.

MORNING MEETING 
Friday, April 5, 1935. 

When the time for commencing the Conference arrived the large 
auditorium and galleries of the great Tabernacle were filled, nearly every 
seat being occupied, with people from the various stakes and missions 
of the Church. 

The first session began promptly at 10 o'clock a. m., at which time 
President Heber J. Grant announced that the Relief Society Singing- 
Mothers, under the direction of Charlotte O. Sackett, would furnish the 
music for this meeting, and would join with the congregation in singing, 
as an opening number, "We thank thee, O God, for a prophet." 

After the singing of this hymn, the invocation was offered by Elder 
Clifford E. Young, President of the Alpine Stake. 

The hymn, "God Moves in a Mysterious Way," was sung by the 
Relief Society Singing Mothers, Harold H. Bennett, soloist.

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

It is a real pleasure to have the opportunity again of assembling with 
the Saints m general conference. All of us undoubtedly rejoice in the 
remarkable growth of the Church. 

CHURCH GROWTH 

I recall that we did not have thirty stakes when, fifty-two years ago, 
I was made a member of the Council of the Twelve. I recall that when 
visiting Rexburg, then a branch of a ward in Cache Valley, we had but 
1300 people north of Cache Valley; we now have, I am sure, more than 
100,000 in that section, counting those that are in Canada. 

Just before becoming one of the Apostles I traveled from Tooele to 
Salt Lake City, then through Salt Lake, Davis, Weber and Box Elder 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT

stakes to Brigham City, and two days and a fraction west, sleeping on the 
ground two nights, to visit a branch of the Grantsville ward of the Tooele 
stake of Zion. We now have half a dozen stakes west of Brigham City. 

GRATEFUL FOR CHANGE IN SENTIMENT 

I rejoice in the organization of new stakes in California, and of one 
in New York. When I think of the opposition toward the Church in 
early days by the people of New York; of the opposition toward our 
people in Ohio, and in Far West ; of their expulsion from Missouri under 
an exterminating order of the governor of the state; when I think that 
Joseph Smith and others of his companions were condemned to be shot 
by order of a court martial, I am grateful for a change in sentiment 
toward our people. 

When I think of Nauvoo, the largest city in Illinois at that time, with 
20,000 inhabitants, that the people had to leave that city, and that after 
Brigham Young and the able-bodied men had left the remnant were 
driven out by a mob, I am grateful for the change that has taken place. 
No tongue can tell and no pen can paint the hardships that our people 
endured in Missouri and Illinois. 

During the three long years that I presided over the European and 
British missions I was unable to get a single, solitary article into any 
newspaper in any part of the British Isles, refuting some of the vilest 
and most wicked slanders that were circulated about the Latter-day 
Saints. Today throughout the entire British Isles reporters attend our 
meetings and make honorable and straightforward reports regarding 
them. 

At the time of the organization of a stake in New York the leading 
newspapers of that great city gave us splendid notices, and there were 
no unfavorable comments. When I think of these things and of the 
wonderful growth of the Church, from about 200,000 when I was made 
an apostle to more than 700,000 today, my heart is filled with gratitude. 
When I realize the good will that was extended to me upon the occasion 
when I spoke, in 1920, before the Knife and Fork club at Kansas City, 
at which time I was given the privilege of talking an hour, while the 
other two men on the program — one of them the president, I think, of a 
university near Chicago — were each given but half an hour, and I was 
advertised as the principal speaker, this having taken place ten miles 
from where our people were located at the time they were driven out by 
the exterminating order of the governor of the state, my heart is full of 
gratitude and thanksgiving. I believe that today the name "Mormon", 
if a man is living in accordance with the teachings of the Gospel of Christ, 
is a certificate of good-will and character, as far as those are concerned 
who know the Latter-day Saints. 

THE GIFT OF FAITH 

I am grateful that from the time I was a child until the present I 
have been blessed with the gift of faith, which is a gift from God. I

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



recall many things as a young man I did not understand, and could not 
comprehend, yet which I believed and believed firmly. One of the 
things which I believed, but which seemed to be an impossibility, was the 
statement that every ear should hear and every eye should see. 



SPEAKS TO WORLD 



/ rejoice that only last Saturday evening — or I should say Sunday 
morning at 12:30—7 had the privilege of broadcasting over Station KSL 
a message from the Latter-day Saints to the people of the world, and that 
later in the day a cablegram was received all the way from Tokio, Japan: 

"Snowing, thousands enjoying program." 

I have been requested by several people to furnish them with a copy 
of that speech, and I have decided to read it here today in order to get 
it into our record: 

I am delighted to have this opportunity to send my message of love 
and blessing to the Latter-day Saints throughout the world, and to all 
others who may be listening in. 

If time permitted I am sure my listeners would be interested in 
'hearing all of the Articles of Faith of the Church of Jesus Christ which 
I represent tonight, and our "Declaration of Belief regarding Govern- 
ments and Laws in general." 

The fifth Article reads: 

We believe that a man must be called of God by prophecy, and by the laying 
on of hands, by those who are in authority to preach the Gospel and administer 
in the ordinances thereof. 

CLAIM OF AUTHORITY 

We claim that authority and declare to all the world that John the 
Baptist, who held the keys of authority to baptize, restored the Aaronic 
priesthood, and bestozved it upon Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery; 
also that Peter, James and John, Apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ, 
restored the higher or Melchisedek priesthood, by ordaining these same 
men to the Apostleship. 

The eleventh Article of Faith reads: 

We claim the privilege of worshiping Almighty God according to the dictates 
of our own conscience, and allozv all men the same privilege, let them worship how 
where, or wlxat they may. 

The thirteenth Article reads in part: 

We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous and in doing 
good to all men . If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praise- 
worthy, we seek after these things. 

REGARDING GOVERNMENTS 

Quoting from "A Declaration of Belief:" 

We believe that governments were instituted of God for the benefit of man; 
and that hehelds men accountable for their acts in relation to them, both in making 
laws and administer -nig them, for the good and safety of society. 

We believe that no government can exist in peace, except such) laws are framed 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



9 



and held inviolate as will secure to each individual the free exercise of conscience, 
the right and control of property, and the protection of life. . . . 

We believe that all men are bound to sustain and uphold the respective gov- 
ernments in which they reside, while protected in their inhernt and inalienable 
rights by the laws of such governments ; and that sedition and rebellion are 
unbecoming every citizen thus protected, and should be punished accordingly ; and 
that all governments have a right to enact such lazvs as in their own judgments 
are best calculated' to* secure the public interest; ai the same time, however, holding 
sacred the freedom of conscience. . . . 

We do not beleive it just to mingle religious influence^ with civil government, 
zvhereby one religious society is fostered and another proscribed in its spiritual 
privileges, and the individual rights of its members, as citizens, denied. 

OUR MESSAGE TO THE WORLD 

What the world needs today more than anything else is an implicit 
faith in God, our Father, and in Jesus Christ, his Son, as the Redeemer 
of the world. The message of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints to the world is that God lives, that Jesus Christ is his Son, and that 
they appeared to the boy Joseph Smith, and promised him that he should 
be an instrument in the hands of the Lord in restoring the true Gospel 
to the world. I quote from a Vision given to Joseph Smith and Sidney 
Rigdon: 

And this is the Gospel, the glad tidings, which the voice out of the heavens bore 
record unto us — 

That he came into the world, even Jesus, to be crucified for the world, and to 
bear the sins of the world, and to sanctify the world, and to cleanse it from all 
unrighteousness ; 

That through him all might be saved whom the Father had put into his power 
and made by him. 

Who glorifies the Father, and saves all the works of his hands, except those sons 
of perdition who deny the Son after the Father has revealed him. 

And again from the same Vision : 

And we beheld the glory of the Son, on the right hand of the Father, and re- 
ceived of his fulness; 

And saw the holy angels, and them who are sanctified before his throng, wor- 
shiping God, and the Lamb, who worship him forever and ever. 

And now, after the many testimonies which have been given of him, this is, the 
testimony, last of all, which we give of him: That he lives! 

For we saw him, even on the right hand of God; and we heard the "Voice 
bearing record that he is the Only Begotten of the Father — 

That by him, and through him, and of him, the zvorlds are and ivere created, 
and the inhabitants thereof are begotten sons and daughters unto God. 

WIDE MINISTRY 

It has been my great privilege to bear this testimony in England, 
Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Germany, France, Holland, Belgium, Switzer- 
land, Italy, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Canada, Mexico, in the Hawaiian 
Islands and in far-off Japan, and to lift up my voice declaring that our 
Heavenly Father and his beloved Son have again spoken from the 
heavens, that the Gospel of our Redeemer has been restored to the earth, 
and to bear witness that I know that God lives, that I know that Jesus 
is the Christ, the Son of the living God and the Redeemer of mankind, 



10 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



and that I know that Joseph Smith was the instrument in the hands of 
the Lord in restoring the everlasting Gospel. 

My appeal to all members of the Church who possess this same 
testimony is so to live that other men seeing their good deeds shall be 
inspired to investigate the Gospel of our Redeemer. 

Words fail me in expressing my heartfelt gratitude to God for the 
radio, which gives me this opportunity of bearing my testimony to all the 
people of the tvorld of the restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. I 
pray the Lord to bless all mankind in these troublous times, that wisdom 
may be given to men in every land so to live that peace may come to 
the peoples of the zvorld. 

(End of radio address to world.) 

GRATEFUL FOR FAITH 

I am utterly at a loss to express my gratitude for the faith that 
I had as a child that the day would come when every ear should hear. 
I am grateful also for the faith that I had at that same time that every 
eye should see. Some years ago it was my privilege while in New York, 
and while in a large building twenty or .thirty stories high, to talk to my 
daughter and my granddaughter by television, they being three or four 
miles away at the time, and I saw them perfectly. 

READS ARTICLES OF FAITH 

I am grateful indeed for every blessing that has come to me be- 
cause of the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, the plan of life and 
salvation, and inasmuch as what, I am saying is being broadcast I am 
going to read all of the Articles of our Faith, although I suppose that 
every soul within the sound of my voice in this building and all 
Latter-day Saints throughout the world are familiar with these Articles, 
and nearly all our children can repeat them. I remember learning 
them as a little child in the Sunday school, but as there may be many 
people in different parts of the world who are hearing what is said here 
today, as I said in my message to the world, I would like to repeat all of 
the articles. Time would not permit my doing so then as I only had ten 
minutes, and kept within the limit given to me. 

We believe in God, the Eternal Father, and in his son, Jesus Christ, and in the 
Holy Ghost. 

When we say that we believe in God we mean that we believe 
in him as an individuality, as actually the Father of Jesus Christ— not 
a congeries of laws floating through the universe without form and void, 
but we believe him to be the Father of Jesus Christ. He is the God whom 
we as Latter-day Saints worship; and we believe Jesus Christ to be, 
not only one of the great moral teachers, the greatest the world has ever 
known, but the Son of God, the Redeemer of mankind, that he came 
to earth with a divinely appointed mission, to die on the cross, in order 
that you and I and all eventually may have part in the resurrection. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 11 



We believe that men will be punished for their own sins, and not for Adam's 
transgression. 

In other words, "as in Adam all die, so in Christ shall all be made 
alive." 

We believe that, through the atonement of Christ, all mankind may be saved, 
by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel. 

NEED OF OBEDIENCE 

We believe emphatically in what it says, "by obedience to the laws 
and ordinances of the Gospel." We have no faith in death-bed repent- 
ance. We have no faith that by making a confession just before death 
we can be saved. 

We believe that the first principles and ordinances of the Gospel are : First, 
faith in the Lord Jesus Christ ; second, repentance ; third, baptism by immersion 
for the remission of sins; fourth, laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy 
Ghost. 

We invite men to read a book entitled "Articles of Faith" which 
contains the scriptural references to sustain our position. 

We believe that a man must be called of God, by prophecy, and by the laying 
on of hands, by those who are in authority, to preach the Gospel and administer 
in the ordinances thereof. 

As I have already stated in my address to the world, we claim that 
authority. 

We believe in the same organization that existed in the primitive Church, 
namely, apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers, evangelists, etc. 

INDIVIDUAL TESTIMONIES 

There would be no need of believing in these various officers 
unless they have the inspiration of the living God and magnify the offices 
they hold. Unless Joseph Smith was in fact and in very deed a prophet 
of the living God, the whole structure called Mormonism falls. But we 
know, it is not a matter of belief. Latter-day Saints have individually 
almost without exception been given testimonies of the divine mission 
of the Prophet Joseph Smith. Hundreds and thousands, yes, hundreds 
of thousands of people who have never gathered to Zion, who have 
never lived in a stake of Zion, from the midnight sun country of 
Scandinavia down to South Africa, have been blessed with individual 
testimonies in answer to earnest prayer, that God lives and that Jesus 
Christ is in very deed his Son, also that Joseph Smith was a prophet of 
God. 

The statement made by the Angel Moroni before the Church was 
born, that Joseph Smith's name should be had for good and evil all 
over the world, has been fulfilled, notwithstanding the fact that the 
statement at the time was ridiculed and Joseph Smith branded as an 
ignoramus. 

PATRIARCHAL BLESSINGS 

Unless the evangelist or patriarch is able, under the inspiration of 



12 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



God, to give blessings which are fulfilled, then there is nothing gained 
by believing in evangelists. As a little child I received a patriarchal 
blessing in which I was promised practically the very things that have 
happened to me all my life. When I was a young man presiding over 
the Tooele stake of Zion, the patriarch of that stake blessed my little baby, 
who was then six months old, and promised her that she should live 
to become a mother; that she should live to become one of the leaders 
of her sisters. Subsequently when she was in a dying condition from 
diphtheria, a spiritualistic medium decreed her death. Thank God for 
the priesthood that is upon the earth and the authority of that priesthood. 
George Q. Cannon and Hiram B. Clawson being in Washington at the 
time, I sent for them to come and administer to my little girl, who, as I 
recall it, was then between twelve and thirteen years of age, and they 
promised her that she should live and become a mother ; and George Q. 
Cannon said something I had never heard before, neither have I heard it 
since. 

He said : 

The adversary, the destroyer, has decreed your death, and made public an- 
nouncement of it, but by the authority of the priesthood of the living God that we 
hold we rebuke that decree and promise you life. 

THE ADVERSARY'S DECREE REBUKED 

I thought time and time again of that remarkable statement. The 
day that I was to leave Washington, the lady who kept the boarding house 
where we were staying was away and her husband was in charge. 

He said : 

Mr. Grant, I cannot resist the temptation to tell you that when your children 
became sick my wife visited her medium — she believes in spiritualistic mediums — 
and her medium told, her that she saw in her home two little girls; that the older 
one was taken sick nigh unto death; that the next little girl was taken sick and 
was nigh unto death. She finally saw the older girl recover, then she saw the little 
girl die, and she saw her body taken to a railroad station ; she saw it taken on a 
train through many large cities, and stop in a large city, and change cars. She saw 
it cross a large river [you all know that one has to cross the Mississippi river to 
come here] she saw it pass through some more cities and cross another large river, 
and then travel through a sparsely settled country. 

(Forty years ago the country west of the Missouri was rather 
sparsely settled). 

She then saw the train climbing mountains, mountains, mountains, going west 
all the time. She then saw it go south for a short distance [from Ogden to Salt 
Lake of course.] She then saw it stop in a valley almost completely surrounded 
by mountains, and then the body was taken to the hill side and deposited in the 
grave. 

Thank God for the power of the priesthood that rebuked the decree 
of the adversary, which decree had been made public. 

BLESSINGS FULFILLED 

As I stated before, the patriarch in Tooele blessed this girl when a 
babe six months of age and said that she would live and become a mother. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



13 



He afterwards said that he would like to give me a blessing, and in that 
blessing he promised me that I should be chosen as one of the leaders 
of this people and become a leader of great magnitude, and not until 
after I became the President of the Church did I ever mention what he 
said to me, and the impression that came to me at the time. 

He said : "Brother Grant, I saw something that I dare not put in 
your blessing." 

And that still small voice that I have heard so many times in my life, 
making no noise, no sound, said to me, "and you shall live to presjide 
over the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints." 

I was ashamed of myself that I should imagine such a thing. I 
never breathed it, I never mentioned it to a soul until after, in the 
providences of the Lord, that position came to me. 

We believe in the gift of tongues, prophecy, revelation, visions, healing, inter- 
pretation of tongues, etc. 

THE GIFT OF TONGUES 

There is no need of believing in these things unless we have them. 
I was a child playing on the floor in a Relief Society meeting (my mother 
was president of the Thirteenth ward Relief Society for thirty long 
years and only resigned because of her hearing having failed) when 
Eliza R. Snow blessed by the gift of tongues each of the presidents that 
happened to be in that meeting, and Zina D. Young gave the interpreta- 
tion. After doing this she turned to the child (myself) playing upon 
the floor, and gave me a blessing, and Zina D. Young gave the inter- 
pretation. 

My mother often said to me. "Heber, behave yourself and you will 
some day be an Apostle." 

I laughed and told her I had no ambitions along that line. I said : 
"Get it out of your head. Every mother thinks that her son will be the 
President of the United States, or something wonderful. I do not want 
any Church position, I want to be a business man." 

"Never mind," she said, "if you behave yourself you will be an 
Apostle." 

When I was made an Apostle she asked me if I remembered that 
meeting. I told her I did. 

"Do you remember anything that Sister Snow said ?" 
I said : "No, I did not understand her." 

"Of course you did not, because she was speaking in an unknown 
tongue. Did you understand anything that Aunt Zina said ?" 

"Only one thing, mother, I remember that as she was talking she 
lifted her hand and said that I would grow to be a big man, and since I 
have grown tall, I have often thought of that remark of hers." 

She said: "She did not say anything of the kind. She said you 
should grow to be a great big man in the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints, and become an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ." 

She then said : "Do you remember being in a gathering in Brother 



14 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Heber C. Kimball's home where there were a great many people, and 
after the dinner Brother Kimball picked you up and put you on the 
table and talked to you ?" 

"Yes." 

"Do you remember anything he said ?" 

"Not a word. All I remember is I thought he had the blackest eyes 
I ever looked at, and I was frightened." 

"Well, he prophesied that you should become one of the apostles 
of the Lord Jesus Christ, and live to be a greater man in the Church than 
your own father; and that is the reason that I have told you that if you 
would behave yourself you would some day be an Apostle. I realized 
that if you did not behave yourself you never would attain to that posi- 
tion, no matter what you had been promised." What she said conforms 
to a revelation of the Lord which says : 

There is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this 
world, upon which all blessings are predicated— And when we obtain any blessing 
from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated. 

I could go on relating evidences of the gift of tongues. 

OTHER ARTICLES 

We believe the Bible to be the word of God, as far as it is translated correctly; 
we also believe the Book of Mormon to be the word of God. 

A great banker in New York said to me after reading Colonel R. 
M. Bryce Thomas' pamphlet, "My Reasons for Leaving the Church of 
England and joining the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints" : 
"Mr. Grant, I am an agnostic, but a student of the Bible, if I believed 
the Bible to be the word of God, I do not see how I could be an honest 
man if after reading this pamphlet I did not join your Church, because 
the scriptural evidences in support of your position cannot be contro- 
verted." 

We believe all that God has revealed, all that he dees now reveal, and we 
believe that he will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the 
kingdom of God. 

We believe in the literal gathering of Israel and in the restoration of the 
Ten tribes; that Zion will be built upon this (the American) continent; that Christ 
will reign personally upon the earth, and that the earth will be renewed, and receive 
its paradisiacal glory. 

We claim the privilege of worshiping almighty God according to the dictates of 
our own conscience, and allow all men the same privilege, let them worship how, 
where, or what they may. 

We believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers and magistrates, in 
obeying, honoring and sustaining the law. 

god's PLAN 

May the Lord help us to sustain the law, and may we obey the law 
of God and leave alone those things that the Lord has told us are not 
good for us. I beg of all of you, young and old, to read the Word of 
Wisdom, and after reading it to get down on your knees and pray to 
God to help you to observe it. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT

The nation is in an awful condition today financially. God gave us 
a revelation for the temporal salvation of the people, and if millions and 
billions of dollars of money were not expended for the things which 
God says are not good for man, peace, prosperity, health, vigor of body 
and of mind would be enjoyed by all the people of these United States. 
The Word of Wisdom is God's plan for the salvation of the people 
temporally, and he lias said so. He has said that it is his will, and if we 
lived up to the will of God, peace, prosperity and happiness would come 
to this nation and to the whole world, — if there were no tea, coffee, 
tobacco, or liquor used in the world. 

Those who are not keeping the Word of Wisdom will say that they 
get sick and tired of hearing such talks. They will get it from me as long 
as I have breath. 

We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing 
good to all men ; indeed we may say that we follow the admonition of Paul : We 
believe all things, we hope all things, we have endured many things, and hope to 
be able to endure all things. If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report, 
or praiseworthy, we seek after these things. 

May God bless us one and all, as I said in my address to the world, 
who have a knowledge of the divinity of this work, to live it, that our 
lives may teach it, is my humble prayer, and I ask it in the name of 
Jesus Christ, our Redeemer and Savior, Amen. 

ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 

Of the Council of the Tzvelve Apostles 

As I listened to the inspirational address delivered by President 
Heber J. Grant, and the excellent music that thrilled our hearts, the 
thought came to me that we are not far from heaven. I am wonder- 
ing whether the late President Charles W. Penrose was listening 
when that fine old hymn which he composed, "O Ye Mountains 
High," was sung this morning. I believe that the leaders of the 
Church who have passed on, are not far from us. A poet said : 

'Tis the sunset of life gives me mystical lore, 
And coming events cast their shadows before. 

MOVING TOWARD A GLORIOUS IDEAL 

The times are out of joint. The forces of evil are stirring up 
agencies, which if left to go unchecked, will destroy civilization and 
the hope's of humanity. I believe that despite all the troubles that 
are in the earth the world is moving toward a glorious ideal, for 
we believe "that Christ will reign personally upon the earth; and 
that the earth will be renewed and receive its paradisiacal glory." 
God is displaying "his rainbow fair against the swarthy clouds." 

The glorious second coming of Jesus Christ has been foretold 
since Adam went out of the Garden of Eden. This bright luminary 
is eternally shining in the heavens; it is sustaining world-weary

hearts. By the vision of faith true followers of the Redeemer behold 
God watching over his own. "Behind a frowning providence He 
hides a smiling face." 

Colonel Lawrence of Arabian fame tells of an Arab sheik, who 
after hearing the western scholar recount the wonders revealed by 
the telescope, said : "You foreigners see millions of stars and nothing 
beyond. We Arabs see only a few stars — and God." Better a 
little learning with God than much learning without him. To be 
learned is good, the Book of Mormon admonishes us, if we obey 
the counsels of God. 

The second advent of the Savior is part of the plan of salvation 
by which men may become the sons of God. The Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints was established and dedicated by the 
power of God for the sublime mission of preaching the everlasting 
Gospel to prepare the world for the glorious second coming of the 
Son of God in judgment. 

god's purposes will be accomplished 

Conditions in the world today resemble a huge seething caldron. 
The perplexities and distress of nations are causing men's , hearts 
to fail them for fear. What is going to be done? Are God's pur- 
poses going to fall to the ground unfulfilled? No! I believe with 
all my heart that there is much work to be done in the world 
before the coming of the Lord. Using the marvelous discoveries 
of science, such as the radio and improved and faster means of 
travel, the Lord will grant to all his children the opportunity of 
hearing the Gospel for he wills that none of his children shall 
perish in ignorance of the plan of life and salvation. And he. will 
give the world a season of peace and rest in order that the Gospel 
shall be universally proclaimed. 

The world is an armed camp. It seems to be the time when 
kings desire to go forth to war. Their words, as the Bible says 
"are as smooth as butter" but deep down in their hearts there is 
war. Only the grace of God can save the world from a cataclysm 
that threatens to destroy civilization and bring despair to human- 
ity. God grant that the statesmen in the nations who are pleading 
and working for peace shall have the power of God to be with 
them so that by their labors distress, agitation, disrespect for law 
and desire for war shall fade out of the minds of men. 

IN THE PROMOTION OF PEACE 

An able editorial in our morning paper yesterday set forth 
that the cost of crime in its social aspects and in its disregard for 
aw is a more tremendous problem than this depression and the 
high taxation under which the people are groaning. The Latter-day 
Saints should always be first and foremost in promoting peace 
not only in the hearts of their neighbors but also in their own 
hearts. The peace and good will we have for all men will go out

of our communities and be a mighty factor in inclining warlike 
men to the paths of peace. 

EVENTS PRECEDING CHRIST'S SECOND ADVENT 

Two great and awful events are foreshadowed in St. Matthew, 
Chapter 24, and also in the 21st Chapter of St. Luke, namely the 
destruction of Jerusalem and the end of the world, which is the 
destruction of the wicked. Jesus wept over the people who per- 
ished in the flood, as he wept over Jerusalem, for he loves mercy 
more than judgment. The events which preceded the destruction 
of Jerusalem came with terrible suddenness. 

The prophecies in the chapters cited came by the will of God. 
The Savior said to the people of his day: "Ye can discern the face 
of the sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the times?" There 
are many who say that the Lord delays his coming. A certain 
writer, in a skeptical spirit, said that the Apostle Paul was "ob- 
sessed" with the idea of the imminence of .Christ's second coming, 
because Paul said to the Saints of his day : "Let your moderation," 
that is meekness and a forgiving spirit, "be known before all men : 
the Lord is at hand." The skeptic ridicules this prophetical declara- 
tion and derisively says that nearly two thousand years have 
elapsed and the Lord is not yet at hand. But this fateful prophecy 
was fulfilled to the very letter, for ten years later the Lord was at 
hand to execute judgment on the Jewish nation. The sufferings 
of the Jews as detailed by Josephus, an eye witness, are certainly 
without parallel in human history. One million Jews perished in 
the siege of Jerusalem ; uncounted multitudes were destroyed in 
other cities. It was a day of the Lord to that unfortunate people. 
The Jewish nation was destroyed. 

A DAY OF THE LORD 

A day of the. Lord is a period fixed by him to execute judg- 
ment upon the nations of the earth. There have been many such 
days. Such days are a foretaste of the coming great and dreadful 
day of the Lord. Before the destruction of Babylon, Isaiah thus 
prophesied to the people of that wicked city : "Howl ye : for the 
day of the Lord is at hand." Babylon's pride was humbled in utter 
desolation. It was a day of the Lord unto that corrupt city : his 
judgments were executed upon her. When the Savior was crucified 
the Western Hemisphere was visited by terrible tempests, thunder, 
earthquakes, whirlwinds and fire, resulting in a great and terrible 
destruction. This awful disaster killed many people. The survivors 
in one place cried : "Oh, that we had repented before this great and 
terrible day." It was a day of the Lord unto the Nephite people. 

I believe that the Civil War was a day of the Lord ; so also 
was the World War and the epidemic of influenza. This world- 
wide depression is a day of the Lord, but no one of these days is 
that great and dreadful day of the Lord which is to come at the 
end of the world. ,

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



WAR A PENALTY FOR CRIMES 

A regiment of Northern soldiers stormed a Confederate fort. 
The young Federal commander fell mortally wounded outside the 
breast works. He was carried to a Southern hospital. His dying 
wish was that his sword be girded on his body and that his coffin 
be covered with his country's flag. He asked the fair Southern 
nurse to sing a verse of the Star Spangled Banner. Southern chiv- 
alry and Southern beauty gratified the requests of the Union of- 
ficer. Then the dying soldier said: "War seems an awful thing. I 
suppose it isn't half so much a crime as it is a penalty for the 
crimes that bring it on." 

Why will not the people of the world engage in national and 
international repentance and humiliation? God is not responsible 
for our calamities. He has pointed out the means of escape. If we 
will turn our faces towards him and repent this depression will 
vanish like magic. Let the spirit of the Prince of Peace be firmly 
fixed in the councils of the nations and observed; then all talk 
about war will cease, and nations shall no longer learn war for 
their "swords shall be beaten into plowshares and their spears into 
pruning hooks." 

WHEN THE GREAT DAY OF THE LORD COMES 

■ Now brethren and sisters, the great day of the Lord is coming. 
It is going to be a terrible day. The wicked are going to be de- 
stroyed, and when I say the wicked I do not mean everybody out- 
side the Mormon Church. There will be countless millions of 
people not of this Church spared because they are not ripe in in- 
iquity and to them we will preach the everlasting Gospel and bring 
them unto Christ. When Jesus Christ comes there is going to be 
a glorious resurrection of the dead. The Millennium will be inau- 
gurated and men in every land and every clime shall live in peace. 

THE MONSTER WE CREATE 

We ourselves are the creators, in a large measure, of our 
troubles. Once, so the old story goes, a medical student determined 
to build a monster out of the cemetery and dissecting rooms. He 
did so, and the thing assumed life. This horrible monster killed the 
student's bride and strangled his best friend. Is there a lesson in 
this for us? This disrespect for law, this encouraging the liquor 
traffic, this disregard for the Sabbath Day, indifference to business 
obligations, neglect of duty to God and country (we believe that 
no man can be a true Latter-day Saint unless he is a loyal citizen 
of the splendid republic in which we live and of which we are 
proud)— this monster which I fear we are building out of these 
grievous ills, will if not eliminated, strangle the youth of the land 
and destroy the flower of our manhood. May God help us all to 
work to sustain law and order and to protect our young men and 
young women.

You fathers and mothers are not living for yourselves any-

deeds, in the making of good laws your desire to have your children 
protected by every safeguard, and ere long the Millennium, whose 
sun is already brightening the hills of coming time, will dawn upon 
us and peace and joy shall be in every heart, and the Redeemer 
shall reign from the rivers to the ends of the earth. War shall be 
abolished. God hasten that day, I humbly pray in the name of 
Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

On one accasion the Master, speaking, as you will find it recorded in 
Matthew 7th Chapter, 21st verse, said "Not everyone that saith unto me, 
Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven ; but he that doeth 
the will of my Father which is in heaven." 

LEARNING OF GOD'S WILL ESSENTIAL 

I regard it as the responsibility of every man and woman who has 
the holy privilege of dwelling upon this earth, provided by someone who 
gives us our life, our being and existence in this world, to learn the 
purposes of the Almighty in placing us here, to learn the will of God, 
and to do it. Apparently it is difficult, however, for men in this age to 
interpret the will of God. In past times it has been clearly understood ; 
however, now there is misunderstanding and that will has been confused. 
No one will dispute the right of the Creator to determine the terms under 
which men have their right of living in this world and also in a world 
that is to come. Under our law we grant to any person who holds 
property the right to set up in a will the terms under which children or 
heirs may inherit. No matter how much we may disagree with the condi- 
tions we cannot inherit unless we subscribe to the terms of the will. So, 
no matter how much we ourselves may disagree with the will of the 
Almighty he has the right to set up the terms, and he that attempts in 
any other way to inherit shall be regarded as a thief and a robber. 

As I have said, the difficulty is that men do not understand the will. 
It is confused by the multitudes who seek to interpret it, one saying^ lo, 
this is the way, and another some other way ; and so hundreds of institu- 
tions claiming to represent the Lord and interpret his will confuse the 
minds of men. I regard every word that Jesus Christ gave men as 
essential for their proper understanding of the will and purposes of the 
Lord. I believe that Jesus Christ preached at least a thousand sermons. 
He was constantly at work and that would have been no more than an 
average of a sermon a day. I cannot think of a single utterance that 
fell from his lips that is not important to the understanding of men in 
this day, as well as in the day when it was given. Unfortunately we do not 



20 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



have all these precious words. They were not recorded until years after 
they were uttered. These gospels were compiled many years afterward, 
and only out of the dim memory of 30 or 40, and in some instances 60 
years, was the story that Christ gave men recorded. If we eliminate the 
duplication of that story, all that Jesus gave us, so far as it is recorded, 
could be confined to seventeen pages of the New Testament. This could 
be read in an hour and fi f teen minutes. 

And then there are the addresses of the apostles who made clear 
many questions concerning which men's minds are now confused and 
we have only fragments of these addresses. . 

AUTHORITY TO INTERPRET DIVINE WILL PROVIDED 

It was the design and the purpose of the Almighty to leave someone 
on the earth to interpret his will and to execute it. If you discover that 
the will of your father or your grandfather names you as an heir, you 
must secure your interest and enter into it in the proper way. You can- 
not subscribe to the terms of the will in the presence of your friends 
and then possess the property. You must go before a competent judge, 
one with the authority to represent the dead owner or maker of the will, 
and in his presence conform to the terms of the will, and he gives you the 
right and title in behalf of the original owner who has passed away. 

Just as this is true in the affairs of men it is also true in the things 
of God. There must be someone who can properly interpret and legally 
execute the will of God. It was clear in the minds of the Apostles that 
they were vested with the right and authority to represent the Master. 
And these twelve men whom he called and selected also had authority to 
execute his will. For this reason Paul said in Ephesians, Chapter 4, 
Verses 11 to 13 : 

And he gave some, apostles, and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and 
some, pastors and teachers ; For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the 
ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ : Till we all come in the unity of the 
faith. 

Here was authority appointed to interpret the will, so that one 
should not say "I am of Paul," and another "I am of Apollos." Is 
Christ divided? No! He himself said once to those who followed him 
that if they were not one they were not his ; and he earnestly prayed 
that they might be one. 

But we know that these apostles were taken by death, and we also 
know that they left no successors. I know that here is a controversial 
point. 

AUTHORITY NOT BESTOWED UPON SUCCESSORS 

I desire to repeat what I said in this pulpit August 12, 1928, and for 
twenty-five years have been proclaiming. (Brother B. H. Roberts used 
effectively a similar argument in 1931 in his radio address.) The men 
of that generation knew more, far more, about what Christ intended and 
what the apostles actually did than we know from the witness and testi- 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 



21 



mony of the Twelve themselves. I propose to show that the authority 
vested in the Twelve, with three of them at their head — Peter, James and 
John — was not bestowed upon successors. First of all, if Peter did go to 
Rome and establish a branch of the Church and appointed the first 
Bishop as his (Peter's) successor in the apostleship he would have told 
his associates of the Twelve about it. There is no record that he made 
any such reference. He did come back and tell them those very remark- 
able circumstances under which the Gospel went to the Gentiles and 
every other circumstance of importance, but of this more important 
matter — far more important for his associates in the Twelve to know 
about, that he had appointed a successor to himself to whom they must 
look — he made no such explanation and reference. So I reach the con- 
clusion that the Twelve did not know or recognize these Bishops of 
Rome as Peter's successors. Neither did the people of the Church, be- 
cause following the death of Peter the Church looked to the surviving 
apostles, and the last of these was John the Beloved, and though he was 
banished on the Isle of Patmos they still looked to him. They sought 
him and rescued him and brought him back, and he went from church 
to church and they heard his word as the very word of God. They did 
not recognize the Bishops of Rome as Peter's successors, but this John, 
the surviving apostle. 

JOHN RECOGNIZED AS THE LEADER 

The Lord himself did not recognize these Bishops of Rome as 
Peter's successors, but he did recognize his surviving apostle John who, as 
one of the Presidency, held the keys of the kingdom with his associates 
Peter and James ; for upon the Isle of Patmos the revelations of the Lord 
were given to this apostle setting forth the will of God to the churches 
of Asia, and showing what should come to pass in the last days. 

Now do not understand that I do not regard these Bishops of Rome 
as good men in the Church of Christ. The first Bishop of Rome, a local 
officer, was Saint Linus who presided from the year 67 to the year 79 
after Christ. He was succeeded by St. Cletus. He presided from 79 
to 91 over that local branch of the Church. He was succeeded by Saint 
Clement, the first, who presided from the year 91 to the year 100 after 
Christ. They were faithful, good men in the Church of Christ, local 
officers but not Peter's successors or presiding officers over the Church. 
And this John outlived all three of these Bishops of Rome and was still 
upon the earth when they were dead and gone. The Church and God 
recognized him as the leader, the last of all the apostles, and no one sets 
up a claim, so far as I know, of authority coming to them from this 
John. It is necessary to dispose of him in order to bring these Bishops 
into a place of presiding authority. 

RESTORATION OF AUTHORITY ESSENTIAL 

This leads me to say therefore that it was essential, since those who 
had the authority to interpret the will of God and to execute it had 



22 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



passed away, to reestablish it upon the earth. It has been the proclama- 
tion of this Church now for more than one hundred years that the holy 
apostleship that was once given by the Master to the disciples of old has 
been restored. We proclaim that in this generation Peter, James and 
John did come to the earth and lay their hands upon the heads of Joseph 
Smith and Oliver Cowdery, and bestowed upon them the holy apostleship 
with all of its rights and authority; and that every man who has been 
ordained an apostle in this Church, each and all of them, has received his 
authority in an unbroken chain back to those who held the keys from 
the Master himself ; and further that one hundred years ago last month 
the Council of Twelve Apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ was once 
again established in the earth. From that day until this they have been 
officiating with the right and the authority to interpret the will of God. 
These volumes that I hold in my hand, the Book of Mormon and the 
Doctrine and Covenants, contain those precious things which Jesus once 
gave to men that were not recorded and have been given again. He has 
made clear his will by these revelations. 

I do not stand with my associates to claim that we are perfect men 
at all, but I know these men from President Grant down to the last of 
those who hold the holy apostleship, and I know they are men who have 
the love of God in their hearts. We may have our imperfections, but I 
know that the inspiration of the Almighty vindicates our claim. Those 
former apostles of Christ, most of them from the humble walks of life, 
were lifted up by the power of their holy calling to become giants in the 
earth and their words of wisdom are quoted and shall be until the ends 
of time. 

DELIVERANCE FROM PRESENT ILLS THROUGH OBEDIENCE 

So, my brethren and sisters, the men who have led this Church 
claiming the right of the apostleship have shown a wisdom and power 
beyond the ordinary man. If this generation had listened to them we 
would have been in an age of peace, happiness, and brotherhood long 
before this time. I want to say to you Latter-day Saints, so near as we 
are to men bearing this holy authority, many of us have eyes and see not, 
and ears and hear not. I call upon you to listen to these men whom God 
has appointed to interpret his will and to execute it. There is no peace 
or safety for the Church except in following their leadership. God has 
vindicated them in the past, he is vindicating them today, and thus we are 
custodians of the sacred will of God and have the right and authority to 
speak in his name. We have no motive in our hearts except the love of 
men. In our hearts is the same love that was in the heart of him who 
loved men so much that he died for them. We have in our souls a desire 
to bless and not to curse ; and especially you Latter-day Saints, whether 
you be rich or poor, I want you to know that in the hearts of these men 
there is no spirit to disregard the humblest of your wants or needs, and 
that if you will listen to their counsel in this conference as they shall be 
prompted and inspired to call your attention to matters of vital import-

ance, the needs of the hour, and follow that counsel, I promise you in the 
name of the Lord deliverance from your own difficulties and peace and 
safety and ultimately salvation in the kingdom of God. May he grant it 
to us through obedience to his divine authority reestablished in the 
earth, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER RULON S. WELLS 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

May the Lord grant me his spirit while I stand before you. 

I recall a very important passage in that matchless sermon, 
the greatest of all sermons — the sermon delivered by the Saviour 
of the world upon the Mount. This particular passage seems to 
me to be all inclusive. Said he — "Be ye therefore perfect even as 
your Father which is in heaven is perfect." It seems to me that 
this comprises the entire sermon, but what a wonderful undertak- 
ing it is to become perfect even as our Father which is in heaven 
is perfect. That is the true goal towards which every true follower 
of Christ should strive. 

The difficulty in attaining his perfection is great, and some- 
times people stand appalled at the very thought of it. Did the Lord 
really mean that we should become perfect? Do not accuse our 
Saviour of being guilty of folly or of teaching that which he did 
not expect to be followed. 

There are two things that are positively essential to the at- 
tainment of that goal for, without them, it would be impossible. 
The Lord knowing this endowed us with those two things that we 
might become perfect. What are they? They are: First, "The Free 
Agency of Man" and second, "The Knowledge of Good and Evil." 
They are fundamental with us. The Lord inspired the writer of 
the Declaration of Independence to put them into that wonderful 
document, wherein it declares that "all men are created equal and 
have been endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, 
among which are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness." These 
are the things that are essential to the attainment of perfection. 

Let no one think that they constitute perfection, nor that the 
freedom of will — the power to think, to determine and to do the 
thing one wills is perfect salvation. It is not. Nevertheless these 
two things are positively essential to the attainment both of per- 
fection and salvation itself ; but whether we shall reach that goal or 
not depends entirely on the use we make of them. If, in the ex- 
ercise of our free agency, we choose the good and reject the evil, 
we are surely preparing ourselves for salvation ; but if on the con- 
trary we choose the evil and reject the good, we are just as surely 
on our way to damnation. 

These two things are God-given attributes. We inherited them 
from our divine parents. They are not the gift of any government 
— they are our inalienable rights with which we have been endowed 



24 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



by our Creator and we may not rightfully be deprived of them by 
any human power. 

Our first venture in the application of these attributes occurred 
in the Garden of Eden. The Lord planted a garden in the east of 
Eden with wonderful trees, among which were the "Tree of Life" 
and the "Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil," and we read : 

And the Lord GJod took the man, and put him into the Garden of 
Eden to_ dress it and to keep it. And the Lord God commanded the 
man saying: "Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat; But of 
the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it, for in 
the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die." (Gen. 2:15, 16, 17.) 

Partaking of the fruit of the "Tree of Knowledge of Good and 
Evil" was forbidden ; not because this knowledge was undesirable, 
for, on the contrary, it was very much to be desired for without 
it man could not become perfect; but because the Lord intended 
that man should exercise his own free agency with which he had 
been endowed thus causing him to assume the full responsibility 
for his own acts be they good or evil; and knowing the dangers 
that await all those who have thus been endowed, and the disaster 
that comes to those who fail, the Lord forbade him and gave him 
full warning that the failure of his venture, should it so be, might 
not be attributed to divine intervention. No ! Adam and his pos- 
terity must now assume full responsibility. 

The sin of Adam consisted in yielding to the temptation of 
the devil and breaking God's commandment; therefore he and his 
posterity must suffer the penalty, which was death. "For the 
wages of sin is death ; but the gift of God is eternal life through 
Jesus Christ our Lord." (Romans 6 :23. ) 

What was the forbidden fruit? I do not think it was an apple, 
a pear or a peach, or anything else of that nature. The result of 
partaking of the fruit is set forth in Genesis 2 :22 : "And the Lord 
said: Behold the man is become as one of us, to know good and 
evil." And now lest he should put forth his hand and partake also 
of the tree of life and live forever in his sin he drove the man out 
of the Garden and placed Cherubim and a flaming sword to guard 
the way to the tree of life — another marvelous tree the fruit of 
which is eternal life which God in his unbounded love bestows 
upon those who love him and keep his commandments. 

Two wonderful trees bearing wonderful fruit — both are good 
and are designed for the perfecting of God's children. To me they 
appear as figures of speech. 

First: The tree of knowledge of good and evil, the fruit of 
which is implied in the name of the tree— the "knowledge of good 
and evil." This is a figure denoting the spirit of Christ or the light 
of Christ. 

In proof of this I quote the following scripture : 

In him was life; and the life was 'the light of man. 

And the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it 

not. 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS 



25' 



That was the true light which enlighteneth every man that cOmeth into the 
world. (John 1 :4, 5, and 9.) 

Again : — 

And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and 
men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. (John 
3:19.) 

And again : 

For behold the Spirit of Christ is given to every man, that he may 
know good from evil. (Book of Mormon, Moroni 7:16.) 

Second: The tree of life, the fruit of which is also implied in 
the name of the tree 'Eternal Life.' God's greatest gift to man, 
but not while under the bondage of sin, for Cherubim and a flam- 
ing sword still keep the way to the tree of life. And what is this 
tree that bears such precious fruit? 

This figure denotes the "Love of God." 

"For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, 
that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting 
life." (John 3:16.) 

Again in the Book of Mormon — -1st Nephi 11 : 25 — it is given defin- 
itely that the tree of life is the "Love of God." 

The fruit of the tree of life is sweet beyond all comparison. 
The fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil is bitter be- 
cause God gave unto man that he should act for himself and choose 
between good and evil. This is the "bitter cup" of an earth life ex- 
perience. We are told in II Nephi 2:15-23 that there needs must be 
opposition and that there could have been no progress had not 
Adam transgressed by partaking of the forbidden fruit. Let me 
read these enlightening paragraphs in full : 

"And to bring about his eternal purposes in the end of man after 
he had created our firs-t parents, and the beasts of the field and the fowls 
of the air, and in fine, all things which are created, it must needs be that 
there was an opposition; even ithe forbidden fruit in opposition to the tree 
of life; the one being sweet and the other bitter. * * * 

And now, behold if Adam had not transgressed, he would not have 
fallen; but he would have remained in the Garden of Eden. And all 
things which were created must have remained in the same state in which 
they were after they were created; and they must have remained forever, 
and had no end. 

And they would have had no children; wherefore they would have 
remained in a state of innocence, having no joy, for thep knew no misery; 
doing no good, for they knew no sin." (II Nephi 2; 15; 22; 23.) 

And furthermore the divine purpose would have been defeated for 
there would have been no posterity. Read also Paragraph 25 : 

Adam fell ithat men might be; and men are, that they might have 

joy. 

But what could the knowledge of good and evil avail us if we 
were not free to choose and how could we choose without that 
knowledge? There is no virtue in doing good under compulsion; 
and likewise there is no vice in doing evil under compulsion, and 
without knowledge of good and evil there could be no sin ; for 



26 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



where there is no law, there can be no condemnation. Now, these 
two things must work together for the perfecting of mankind. 

In all this that I have said, and more particularly in what I 
have read from the revealed word of God, the divine purpose with 
regard to mankind is made as plain as day ; namely that we might 
become "perfect even as our Father which is in heaven is perfect." 
But what a tremendous undertaking and what a perilous venture 
for mankind ! To have a knowledge of good and evil and be en- 
dowed with freedom to act according to our own free will. 

I have read of the perils of the sea and have greatly admired 
those dauntless voyagers and early explorers who sailed out into 
the great unknown- — the boundless and uncharted ocean. These 
brave and courageous men were the heroes of my boyhood days. 
How they battled the winds and the waves and the mountains of 
ice, to say nothing of the mutiny of their ofttimes rebellous crews 
who being less courageous sought safety in return to their native 
shores. 

But these dangers and perils are as nothing when compared 
with those encountered by man when he launched his barque or 
set his sail for his voyage upon life's sea. 

"Paddling your own canoe" is a noble undertaking. Having 
our free agency and a knowledge of good and evil might be a 
simple affair if there were no opposing winds ; but the devil came 
also with all his temptations, allurements and deceptive lies to 
entice men to sin and lead them away from God, for as already 
stated, there must needs be opposition and hence our problem is 
to exercise our free agency in choosing between good and evil 
which we are able to do by reason of the knowledge we have ; but 
"A little knowledge is a dangerous thing" said the poet — "Drink 
deep or taste not the Pierian spring." 

In order to get a clear understanding of the dangers and perils 
of our earth life experience, let us consider for a few moments the 
havoc and disaster wrought upon mankind as a result of the con- 
flict between the forces of good and evil. Think of the murder of 
Abel by his brother Cain and the curse of the Almighty that fell 
upon the latter and his posterity as a result; think of the wicked- 
ness of the world in the days of Noah: 

And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, 
and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil 
continually. 

And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth . . . 
(Gen. 6:5, 6.) 

So great was the wickedness that God destroyed the whole 
race excepting only Noah and his family by sending the greatest 
deluge the world has ever known. 

Consider Sodom and Gomorrah and the slaughter of the inno- 
cents in the days of Herod, and the massacres of Genghis Khan 
and of the Hugenots, on the eve of St. Bartholomew. Consider 
the "great world war" and the millions of lives that were sacrificed. 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS 



27 



Then think of all the murders, the adulteries and robberies — of the 
kidnapings and burglaries, and the evils of avarice and greed and 
all the whole category of crimes with which the world has been af- 
flicted and all because men, in the exercise of their free agency un- 
der the temptations and deceptions of the devil, have chosen the 
evil rather than the good ; have loved darkness rather than light. 
No wonder then that God who foresaw the whole drama of human 
life warned Adam of its dangers and perils, and of its trials and 
tribulations and finally of death, for said he : "In the day thou 
eatest thereof thou shalt surely die." 

Thus wickedness grows rampant in the world until the earth 
is ripe for the hour of God's judgment when "all the proud and 
they that do wickedly shall be as stubble and I will burn them up, 
saith the Lord of hosts, that wickedness shall not be upon the 
earth." 

This is indeed a gloomy picture of the great conflict which 
is still raging in the world, and one might well be struck with 
terror if there were not a brighter side. One might well complain 
against the Lord who made him, for driving him out of his presence 
into a wicked world to shift for himself against an evil foe, even 
the arch-enemy of God, the adversary of our souls, unless at the 
same time he fortified him for the conflict and offered him the nec- 
essary protection. 

Let no one think that God has failed in this. No indeed ! He 
has provided for our full safety and a successful voyage across the 
perilous sea of life. He gave us holy commandments and warned 
of dangers ahead. He was on our right hand and on our left. He 
pointed out the right way and he warned against the wrong way ; 
but he used no compulsion ; he let us choose for ourselves because 
his plan is to prove us and see "if we will do all things whatsoever 
the Lord our God shall command us." But what is most important 
of all, he gave us a Pilot who knew the reefs, the rocks and the 
shoals of the sea, who commanded the waves and the winds 
and they obeyed. "For God so loved the world, that he gave his 
only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him should not per- 
ish, but have everlasting life." (John 3:16.) All things, whatsoever 
the Lord, our God shall command, are embodied in the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ. Therefore the path of safety is : Believe in the Lord 
Jesus Christ, repent and be baptized everyone of you for the re- 
mission of your sins, and get the gift of the Holy Ghost by the 
laying on of hands by servants of God who have been commis- 
sioned of Jesus Christ to perform these sacred ordinances. 

To believe in him is choosing the good — to repent is rejecting 
the evil, therefore; "Resist the devil and he will flee from you. 
Draw nigh to God and he will draw nigh to you." (Jas. 4:7-8.) 

This is the proper use of these two divine attributes, the "Free 
Agency of Man" and the "Knowledge of Good and Evil," with 
which God has endowed us and which are positively essential to 
the attainment of our goal, — perfection. This is also the way to 



28 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



secure the remission of our sins and the gift of the Holy Ghost 
which is the spirit of truth that leadesh unto all truth, and if we 
get it and keep it by right living, it will surely lead us to the "Tree 
of Life" which is the "Love of God" the fruit of which tree is sweet 
beyond all comparison. "The Tree of Life" is also known as the 
"Well of living water springing up into everlasting life." (John 
4:14.) 

Attaining to these heights means perfection. 

"Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in 
heaven is perfect." 

May the Lord safely pilot us into that haven of safety even 
the "Love of God" where perfection reigns supreme. — Amen. 

The Relief Society Singing Mothers sang an anthem, "The Lord's

ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

I desire to speak on "Orthodoxy" or more definitely on the subject, 
"Being Orthodox." 

I am led to believe that this subject is timely and of some general 
importance by many expressions which have reached me, coming from 
both young and mature people in the Church, which seem to indicate 
that there is something of an aversion to being considered orthodox. 
Not infrequently does one hear it said, "Yes, I am a member of the 
Church. I think it is all right, but I don't pretend to be orthodox." 

TRUE DEFINITION OF ORTHODOXY 

The manner of making such a statement, or others like it, usually 
carries the implication that the one who takes this position regards being 



ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 



29 



orthodox as something of a stigma or blot on his intelligence. He 
seems to think that orthodoxy is opposed to broadmindedness and in- 
dicates contraction of view. From the technical definition of the word, 
of course, this interpretation is erroneous. Orthodox means, "correct 
or sound in doctrine; holding the commonly accepted faith." 

I am not, however, particularly concerned with the technical mis- 
interpretation in the use of the term, — what interests me, and I believe 
it to be important, is the attitude on the part of members of our Church 
which prompts them to seemingly take some pride in the assertion that 
they do not hold to the "commonly accepted faith." 

CLEAR THINKING NECESSARY 

I can not help believing that much of this attitude results from 
misconception of Church doctrine and illogical thinking in consequence 
thereof. I feel sure that many who express skepticism are not really 
as, skeptical as their talk would indicate, and that some who think them- 
selves skeptical could easily remove their doubt by a little clear thinking. 
There is something else that both parties need which I will mention 
later. 

Now what is requisite to be "correct and sound in the doctrine" of 
our Church ? To what must we subscribe ?! In answer to this question 
I might, with propriety, quote the thirteen Articles of our Faith, which 
have stood as our guide for such a long period of time and which are 
so comprehensive and enlightening. But I am not going to do this. 1 
am going to try to simplify and condense the answer. The answer I 
propose is this : Accept Christ and Joseph Smith. I mean, of course 
to accept the Savior for what he said he was, and likewise to accept 
Joseph Smith for what he said he was. If we can really do this, our 
doctrine will be orthodox. 

INTELLIGENT BELIEF CONSISTENT 

One can not accept the Divine Sonship of Jesus Christ without 
acknowledging the Eternal Fatherhood of God — nor the Father and 
the Son as revealed, without the Holy Ghost. There is certainly no con- 
sistency in accepting Christ as Lord, without accepting the whole of 
his Gospel as divine. I have never been able to understand how intel- 
ligent, educated men could reconcile the logic or illogic of accepting 
the authenticity of that portion of the record of the Savior which sets 
forth his incomparable teachings and philosophy, and at the same time, 
deny the correctness of the same record which proclaims his Divine 
Sonship and Lordship. What justification is there for credence in a 
part of the record and not all of it; or believing some of the things the 
Master said and not all that he said? I admit that it may be easier, 
in that it requires less faith, to accept some parts, rather than other 
parts, but from the standpoint of the authenticity and validity of the 
record itself, which is admittedly the source from which we obtain our 
knowledge and information of the Christ, how can one part be true 



30 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



without all being true? To that question I have never been able to 
discover a satisfactory answer. 

Then too, the part of the record which the so-called higher critics 
and some of our skeptical friends would discredit, while accepting other 
parts, is the most important and surely the most vital thing connected 
with the Redeemer's work and message. 

TRUTH A REQUISITE 

Was he what he said he was? I think all thoughtful persons 
must agree that the significance of his Lordship is infinitely greater 
than the ethics of his teachings. Of course, it is easier to believe in 
the Golden Rule than in the virgin birth or the transfiguration. We can 
understand the one far better than the other. It takes faith to accept 
the things we do not understand. Perhaps on that very account, they 
are of more importance and lasting benefit to us, because they require 
and develop faith which is the very genius and essence of the Savior's 
life, work and mission. No student of the scriptures, I believe, will 
deny that. 

Perhaps it will not be too much of a digression from the theme to 
ask the question at this point : Why is it so difficult to accept things on 
faith ? I think I can suggest an answer. It is because we are so conceited. 
Men of the world are in the world only because they adopt the philosophy 
of the world which is the philosophy of self sufficiency. It is not a 
humble philosophy — it is highly egotistical. It makes men themselves 
the arbiters of all things. They look to no higher source than themselves 
for the solution of all questions. 

Such a philosophy is diametrically opposed to the philosophy of 
Christ which is that of faith. When men adopt his philosophy they are 
humble — they acknowledge an intelligence far superior to their own and 
they seek guidance and wisdom from that source. When they adopt 
the philosophy of faith, they come out of the world, for the world, as 
a term in theology is not a place but a condition or state of mind and 
feeling. It requires courage to come out of the world and adopt the 
philosophy of faith. Sometimes it subjects one to ridicule and the 
contempt of friends which are harder for most men to endure than 
physical pain; but because a thing is hard to do or hard to believe is 
no assurance that it is not right. 

NOT HARD TO HAVE FAITH 

I am one, however, who believes that it is not so hard for most 
people to have faith and accept spiritual realities if they will but let 
their minds and their native inclinations pursue their natural bent. I 
think that altogether too often we permit thinking complexes and 
sophisticated reasoning to warp our intuitive judgment and entrammel 
the spontaneous feelings and emotions of our souls. So, when I pre- 
scribe the acceptance of Christ as a condition of orthodoxy, I mean an 
acceptance without reservation — a whole souled, intelligent, joyous ac- 



ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 



31 



ceptance of him that proclaims him, Lord, Savior, Redeemer and 
Mediator with the Father and lays claim on his mercy, his grace and 
his love for all the finer things we know in life. What hope — what 
peace and satisfaction such a full acceptance of the Christ brings to 
the heart of man, only those who have received a testimony of Jesus 
will ever know. 

ACCEPTANCE OF JOSEPH SMITH 

Now the next thing is to accept Joseph Smith — to believe in him as 
a prophet and ordained servant of the Lord Jesus Christ. Many of 
the things which have been said about the Savior, apply with equal 
force to the Prophet. The record which he left is more full, more 
recent and far more susceptible of verification than the early Gospels. 
Many have assailed the record but no one has ever succeeded in dis- 
crediting it. Many thousands to whom the record has come have not 
believed it but the thousands who have believed have furnished in their 
lives and work verification and support which thoughtful observers 
can not ignore. 

The Prophet's own story requires faith for its acceptance as does the 
account of the Savior. It deals with unusual and supernatural experi- 
ences which relatively few have ever enjoyed but which no one has 
ever had the actual knowledge to deny. 

LAME ATTEMPTS 

I have known a few people and I have heard of others who attempt 
to explain the extraordinary manifestations to the Prophet in ways 
other than he accounted for them. I have always felt that such at- 
tempted explanations were lame, unwarranted and pure conjecture, 
and sometimes conspicuously anomalous because, while attempting to 
explain away the phenomena of the divine manifestations to the Prophet, 
an effort is made to uphold the validity of his teachings and doctrine. 

There are a few who assert that it is immaterial whether or not the 
Prophet's account of himself is true, and sufficient to know that the 
organization which he initiated and the doctrines he taught are salutary 
and helpful. Some go so far as to indicate that they would prefer 
to pass over the miraculous story of the Prophet Joseph and repose 
their faith and confidence in Brigham Young, his leadership and accom- 
plishments. These are some of the views held by those who are counted 
unorthodox. 

_ The views certainly are not orthodox and I think they are not 
logical nor consistent. I lay it down as fundamental that the vitality 
and validity of the work of our Church stands or falls with the verity 
of Joseph Smith's own story. 

RIGHT OF SUCCESSION 

Wjhat would be the efficacy of our priesthood, had he not received 
the divine bestowal as he said? What of all the ordinances, the cere- 



32 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



monies, the work of our temples if the source is impugned? Brigham 
Young freely acknowledged that not only his authority but the doctrines 
which he taught and the genius of the organization which he carried 
forward all came to him from and through the Prophet. The man who 
stands at our head today is where he is only because he comes in rightful 
succession from the Prophet and exercises the authority handed down 
to him from that source. 

FUNDAMENTALS UNCHANGED 

It is true that the Church has developed some new methods and 
organizations since the days of the Prophet but there is nothing funda- 
mentally essential in doctrine or organization which we have today 
that was not given to us through the Prophet Joseph Smith. 

I am sure it is not necessary to mention further reasons why it is 
absolutely necessary to accept the Prophet Joseph Smith, his testimony 
and his work as a condition to full fellowship in the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints ; nor do I expect that I shall encounter any 
considerable disagreement with what I have heretofore said. I believe 
the conclusions which I have stated are not susceptible of successful 
contradiction. In fact they may seem so obvious as scarcely to warrant 
any discussion. 

INDIFFERENT AND CRITICAL MEMBERS 

There is another phase of this subject which is not so obvious and 
on which I wish to make a few suggestions. I believe tha\t there 
are many people in the Church, who, deep down in their hearts, have a 
conviction of the divinity of the Church and its work, but, for one 
reason and another, seldom, if ever, acknowledge this conviction, even 
to themselves. In many cases, such people have come from Latter-day 
Saint homes and have had early training in the organizations of the 
Church. Then they have become inactive and finally indifferent or 
critical. Most of this class still claim membership or at least admit 
membership but they acknowledge that they are not orthodox and 
seem rather proud of it. 

I wish I could help them analyze their own condition because 
I believe if they would take the trouble to do that, it would be the 
first step toward a new and happier life for them. I have a feeling 
that most of the class which I have just described are not entirely happy 
and contented with their hike warm, partial allegiance to the Church, 
especially at such times as they may seriously ponder the matter. They 
realize without my telling them that their position is inconsistent with 
any logical deduction they can make. They know that the challenge of 
the Gospel is such that it means everything to one who embraces it, if 
it means anything at all. If they are parents, they are often very 
pleased to have their children receive the benefits of Church training. 
They are concerned for the welfare of their children and they know 
that the influence of the Church is good. Why is it then, that they 



ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 



33 



do not or can not call back into full force their testimony of the truth, 
enjoy the companionship of the Holy Spirit and rejoice in the associa- 
tions of the Church ? 

I am not sure that I can answer this question for many, but I am 
sure that each can answer for himself, if he will but frankly look into 
his own life, feelings and conduct. I think I can promise to each that 
if he will scrutinize himself as critically as he does the authorities and 
the procedure of the Church he will discover the reasons which underly 
his own disaffection. This is not so easy to do and not nearly so 
interesting as it is to criticize others. One seldom has company when 
he is analyzing himself and the conversation he carries on with himself 
is never very scintillating. The parties to the conversation, — he and 
himself, know all the facts and they have to be so brutally frank that, 
sometimes it is really painful to listen in. But when the conversation 
centers about others with sympathetic company it isn't necessary to 
have more than a mere smattering of the facts to make a colorful, in- 
teresting story. 

DISPOSITION TO CRITICIZE 

Now I'm not complaining that the authorities and policies of the 
Church are subjected to criticism. If the criticism were constructive 
and if it could reach those who could remedy defects when they are 
shown, it might be very profitable. It is my desire, not so much to save 
the Church from criticism as to save the critics from themselves. I 
know without being told that the men who administer the affairs of the 
Church in both general and local capacity are men with human frailties 
and. imperfect wisdom and judgment. I know too that they are humble 
men and that they diligently and prayerfully seek to give to the service 
of their fellows the best that is within them. There may be a few excep- 
tions but they are very rare, indeed. With such a disposition manifest 
in our leaders and officers, surely it is not going too far to ask /for 
forbearance of judgment and kindly, tolerant consideration and particu- 
larly a full investigation of the facts before adverse criticism is either 
entertained or uttered. I believe that if we could once and for all abandon 
the practice of long range, ill considered, intemperate criticism, thou- 
sands of people would save themselves, their faith and others; — and 
relatively few in this Church would regard themselves or be regarded 
as unorthodox. 

TRUE WORSHIP OVERCOMES CRITICISM 

Worship is an essential part of religion. Who can go to a place of 
worship and enjoy the sanctifying, refreshing_ influence which comes 
from prayer, songs of praise, communion with the Saints and the 
lovely spirit which pervades a reverential assembly, if his mind is filled 
with critical thoughts. In fact, when he is in such a condition he does 
not enjoy worship and he ceases to attend the meetings of the Church. 
It is surprising how rapidly disintegration of faith sets in. Skepticism

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



and doubt follow and sometimes apostasy, but more often indifference. 

I wish I could say something to check those who are on the road to 
indifference, and I wish I could call those who have already gone far 
astray back to the faith and the fold of the Church. I recognize that 
my words, however deep my feelings may be, can do but little and that 
each must do the things that are necessary for himself. I do want 
to hold out encouragement, however. I can give positive assurance 
that everyone whose spiritual progress is being retarded by critical 
thoughts, doubt and skepticism can remove the obstacles if he but has 
the will to do it. I can likewise give assurance that anyone who will 
make this effort will be amply and richly rewarded all the days of his 
life. 



A PLEA TO THE INDIFFERENT 

We need the services of the able men and women in this Church 
who regard themselves as being unorthodox. Some of them are among 
the brightest and most capable people that we have in the Church and 
many are of excellent character. Not a few are in the professional and 
business world and have permitted their vocations to so completely 
occupy their time and attention that they have neglected their oppor- 
tunities and duties in the Church,— in consequence of which, they find 
their affection to the great cause has waned and their faith has declined. 

Come back, you lawyers, doctors and men of affairs— we. need you 
and you need us. Your faith is not dead, it is but sleeping. You know 
that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and you know that Joseph 
Smith is a prophet. That knowledge was given to you to bring you 
joy and faith. It will condemn you and bring you misery if you do not 
heed it. I plead with you, my dear brethren and sisters, who are not 
in this conference today, who are seldom in any meeting of the Church 
if m any way my words shall reach you, come back to those who love 
you. You will find open arms to receive you. You are not ostracized 
because you have departed from the straight path of duty— you belon°- 
to a Church which is the Church of Christ, with the Christian virtues 
of mercy, forgiveness and tolerance. Many of you have entered the 
new and everlasting covenant— that great compact with God, our Eternal 
father, as first party, and all of us, his children as second parties by 
virtue of which you are to receive blessings and joys that pass 'the 
understanding m return for keeping his commandments. Do not for- 
feit your rights— they are much too important to you and your loved 
ones. You can not afford to set an unworthy example— your children 
will see it— other men's children will be influenced by it— it will fill 
you with remorse to know that you have led one soul astray. 

. , 1 need not remind y° u of all that you should do, your hearts will 
guide you if you will but consult them. If you are not ashamed of 
the Gospel, criticism and doubt will leave you,— faith and love will take 
their place. You will bless humanity and God will bless you

ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

As some of you know, I have been absent for a short time from the 
city, and I am very glad and happy to come back. I am glad that I came 
back "right end to," because I have been in doubt and a good deal of 
uncertainty about what they call life. 

I am not disposed to talk about death — to me it is a gruesome sub- 
ject ; I am willing to try to encourage the other fellow, but I cannot get 
much happiness out of it for myself. 

I stand before you Latter-day Saint people, not knowing why I 
should be fearful, or doubtful, or uncertain. In April — this conference 
time — I have been in the First Council of the Seventy for forty-two 
years, and I have stood in this Tabernacle from time to time during those 
long years and have failed in attending but very few conferences. 

You may think that what I am going to say is personal, but I am 
given to talking about personal things. Brother Claude Richards wrote 
a book in which he assembled together forty talks that I have made in 
this Tabernacle under the direction of the brethren of the Authorities. 
Of course, those talks were approved or they would not have been 
printed. I have been absent in California, and have had plenty of time 
to think. The brethren of the Authorities have been exceedingly lenient 
and kind to me, and when I get the blues — which I do occasionally, I 
become melancholy without much trouble — at such times I read this 
J. Golden book. If you could get as much faith and joy and hope and 
encouragement out of it as I did, it is worth $2.50. 

It is not because things are printed in it that I have said, that I 
make this statement, but I know just as well as I know the sun sets that 
there are in that book testimonies and things that I never could repeat. 
Under the influence of the Holy Spirit in talking to the people, God 
gave me the spirit of testimony. I have read those testimonies — there 
are forty of them, forty talks — and I challenge you to find one of them 
in which I did not get the spirit of testimony, the spirit of my office and 
calling as a witness for God. I ought to be happy and I am. 

I am verging on my eighty-second year. I have the same living 
testimony today that I had when I began this work. I have the same 
testimony that I had when I stood in Virginia proclaiming the Gospel 
of Jesus Christ to the people just fifty years ago. I am telling you good 
people I have had a full life of experience, having a wife and six chil- 
dren, with all life's joys, struggles, hardships and sacrifices. I am tell- 
ing you plainly and frankly that the greatest joy, the greatest peace, and 
the greatest happiness I have ever had in my life have come when speak- 
ing under the spirit of testimony. I have felt that thrill throughout my 
being. It is a joy and happiness that cannot be expressed. 

I stand before you unafraid and just as humble as a child. I marvel, 
I wonder, I cannot understand why I have lived as long as I have. I am 
proud in representing the First Council of Seventy, in which Council I 
have been associated for forty-two years. I look back with joy and pride 
and thank the Lord from the bottom of my heart that I have been one so 



36 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



favored as to associate not only with the brethren of the First Council, 
but also with the Council of the Twelve and the Presidency of the 
Church. We have now — outside of Brother Rulon S. Wells, who is 
about the same age as myself, though perhaps much stronger physically — 
more vigorous men in the First Council than for some years. 

I hereby testify they are men well chosen ; they are men I am proud 
to associate with ; they are men who are worthy and capable ; they are 
men who have the Gospel of Jesus Christ burning in their souls. All I 
desire, if I never speak again, is that they live up to the tradition of the 
Seventies. I am of the old school and declare that the revelations in 
Section 107 of the Doctrine and Covenants are just as clear, just as un- 
derstandable, just as comprehensive as the noon-day sun as to the calling 
of the Seventy. There need be no contention regarding the matter; 
there need be no difference of opinion. It is fixed, it is settled, it is 
fastened, as to the calling of a Seventy. He is a special witness of the 
Lord, the bearer of the message, under the direction of the Twelve 
Apostles, and it is his duty and calling to go out into the world and preach 
the Gospel continuously. 

I have in my pocket now, yellow with age, the teachings of Jesus 
Christ to his Apostles and to the Seventies, and I know of no revelation 
that changes or annuls Christ's teachings one whit. I do not criticize nor 
find fault with the methods by which we preach the Gospel, but I know 
just as well as I know I live and breathe that if you have the faith God 
will provide the way. 

When we think we can preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ without 
sacrifice, without hardship, without persecution, then we have changed 
the whole plan. I used to tell our Elders in the South: "You let these 
Christian churches alone and if you do not you will bring on yourselves 
persecution. I am telling you Elders" — (and I told it to them in the 
woods where they would not forget it) — "if you will go out under the 
influence of the Holy Ghost and testify that God is the Father, that 
Jesus is the Christ, that Joseph Smith is a Prophet of God, you will get 
all the persecution you can stand." 

I am a living witness that this is true, for the devil hates that testi- 
mony, and he tried to destroy my father and others of the brethren when 
they opened that great mission in England. Everything in his power 
was done. When Heber C. Kimball returned to the Prophet he was 
alarmed and wondered if he had done anything that was wrong. The 
Prophet told him: "No. You were so close to the Father that there 
was only a thin veil between you and God, and whenever the Elders of 
Israel are to accomplish a great work, the devil gets in his power." 

I pray the Lord to bless you good people. I have been in California 
living among those people there ; I attended two of their stake confer- 
ences, I partook of their spirit ; they have the same spirit, the same love, 
the same kindness that we have here, and it repaid me for my trip to 
associate with those good people. I am telling you, in a burst of confidence 
that they do not want to come back, either ; they like that country, and I 
do not blame them. 

May the Lord bless you and the brethren of the Authorities, whom

I sustain as fully and completely as I know how. I pray for these bless- 
ings in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER WILFORD W. RICHARDS 

President of the North Central States Mission 

On the first day of November, 1831, the Prophet Joseph Smith re- 
ceived a revelation. That revelation came to be Section one of the Doc- 
trine, and Covenants. It stands as the Lord's preface to that great and 
wonderful book. I desire to read briefly from this section, beginning with 
verse two, as follows : 

For verily the voice of the Lord is unto all men, and there is none to escape ; 
and there is rio eye that shall not see, neither ear that shall not hear, neither heart 
that shall not be penetrated. 

And the rebellious shall be pierced with much sorrow ; for their iniquities shall 
be spoken upon the housetops, and their secret acts shall be revealed. 

And the voice of warning shall be unto all people, by the mouths of my disciples, 
whom I have chosen in these last days. 

And they shall go forth and none shall stay them, for I the Lord have com- 
manded them. 

Behold, this is mine authority, and the authority of my servants, and my 
preface unto the book of my commandments, which I have given them to publish 
unto you, O inhabitants of the earth. 

This represents the challenge to the present dispensation. We 
carry the glad tidings to God's children in all the earth. I am grateful to 
be in that field of service which has to do with the carrying of the voice 
of warning to the people of the world. I am grateful to be associated with 
the calling of the priesthood, that gives me the responsibility as well as 
the blessings and inspiration associated with the life of a missionary. 

I am happy to have followed, in the North Central States Mission, the 
work of President John G. Allred and President Arthur Welling. They 
were both able and courageous men, champions of truth. Elder Welling, 
my immediate predecessor, did a wonderful work in that mission, and has 
many friends. His testimony has been borne up and down those states 
and two Provinces of Canada, wherever opportunity was afforded. I am 
grateful for the spirit which he left there, for the companionship which 
he gave me, as I was introduced into that mission some nine months ago. 

The people have not forgotten the blessing and service which came 
to them through the association of Elder Melvin J. Ballard, on his trip 
through the mission in June and July of last year. They are inquiring 
when again they shall have the blessing and companionship of another 
member of the General Authorities of the Church. They send to you, 
my brethren of the General Authorities of the Church, their love, their 
devotion and their spirit of loyalty. They are grateful for membership 
in this Church, and have attempted to show that gratitude in the past year 
in many ways, one of which is marked more particularly by the payment 
of tithes, to the extent of an increase of fifty-five per cent oyer the year 
previous. They are rallying to support the truths of this dispensation,

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



the ideals and ambitions of the standards of the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints. 

We have associated there with us some sixty missionaries, your 
sons and daughters, and they are doing a service of which we are proud, 
and of which you too, I am sure, are proud. They are reflecting the 
homes from which they came. They are reflecting the teachings they 
have received in the organizations of the Church, in the wards and stakes 
of Zion in which they have lived. They are going forward according to 
the commandments of the Lord in this dispensation, two by two, bearing 
their testimonies with fortitude and purpose, and are thinking always 
of the things which they may be able to accomplish to magnify their 
callings and to bring credit and joy to our Father in heaven and to the 
Church. 

We have in the North Central States Mission five full-term mis- 
sionaries who are in other parts of the world, and one who has this day 
appeared preparatory to a missionary training course, that he too might 
go to the foreign land of Norway and bear his testimony in the land of 
his birth, among his own people. 

The work is progressing in the North Central States Mission. The 
Lord has been kind to us, and merciful, inspiring our missionaries to dili- 
gence, even a new diligence, we believe, in the service of the Church. 
They are finding many people who are interested in hearing the story of 
the Gospel, and are opening their homes, in many instances, to cottage 
meetings and to conversations. They are really interested in knowing 
that for which the Latter-day Saint missionary stands, and the cause 
which he represents. 

. In the northern part of North Dakota, one of our special mission- 
aries, Brother Armin Hill, a teacher in one of the state schools there, 
has developed an interesting situation. He found friendship among the 
young people of a certain church. They invited him to assist them, 
which he has done using a good deal of our M. I. A. program. Just 
recently, through the illness of the minister of the church, Brother Hill 
has been appointed temporarily in charge of the congregation, with pretty 
much of a free hand to teach and do the things which he desires to do. 

We have had opportunity recently to go upon the grounds adjacent 
to the University of Minnesota, and there meet with a hundred or more 
young people, students of that university, at their invitation, to explain to 
them the background of faith and the principles of the Gospel of Tesus 
Christ. 

We are grateful for all of these opportunities, and see the hand of 
the Lord m the ministry of the missionaries in our mission. 

The State of Minnesota and some parts of the country in its vicinity 
have particularly impressed us as being a field where people are religious. 
1 here are three hundred and twenty-five churches in the city of Min- 
neapolis. They have a system of week-day religious education, which is 
interesting to us, in which our own children are able to participate. 
There is a state law in Minnesota which provides three hours of released 



ELDER WILFORD W. RICHARDS 



39 



time from the schools each week for the use of religious education. This 
has interested me, especially since I have been associated in this work 
at home. 

The Lord has opened the way for men and women to be happy, to 
serve him and each other, and to rejoice in the great privileges that have 
come in this dispensation, but our hearts must be, right. 

I am reminded of a little story, an incident rather, related by an 
author, Preston Bradley. He tells of a young child disturbing her 
father during the reading of his morning newspaper. He, turned to her, 
taking a piece of that paper upon which was a map of the world, torn in 
pieces, and said : "Now, my daughter, see if you) can put that together." 
She did so in such a brief period of time that he was surprised. So he 
questioned her, he said : "How could you do it?" She said-: "Why, 
Daddy, on the other side of the paper was a picture of a man. I put the 
man together and the world came out all right." 

Perhaps after all there is something of a challenge in that incident. 
At least, I have accepted it myself as a missionary. This good old world 
of ours, if we can put the men together properly it will come out all right. 
And so the missionaries of the North Central States Mission are attempt- 
ing, in their humble way, to find their place among mankind, and so to 
inspire them with the privileges and opportunities of living the truths of 
the Gospel of Jesus Christ, to the end that they and all of us may con- 
tribute to the happiness, and the simplification of these many complex 
problems in our social and political life of today. 

May God bless you, my brethren and sisters, especially you parents 
of missionaries, struggling in your efforts to maintain them there. We 
have many testimonies of the assistance of the Lord in connection with 
that work financially. May you not tire. May you be not discouraged. 
Your sons and daughters are doing a work that will fully justify every 
effort you can make for them in the cause of righteousness. 

I desire to bring to this conference, to you, my brethren and sisters, 
the love and appreciation of the missionaries and Saintsi of that mission, 
and to the Authorities of this Church, those who labor so diligently in this 
work. We have trust and confidence in them. I give it to you at this time 
as their message, asking God's blessing upon all. I do it in the name of 
Jesus Christ, Amen.

Singing Mothers, violin obligato by William Hardiman. 

ELDER LeGRAND RlICHARDS 

President of the Southern States Mission 

I am very happy, my brethren and sisters, in having the 
privilege of representing the good people and the missionaries of 
the Southern States Mission. It is needless to say that I am 
proud to be honored of the Lord and my brethren to preside in 



40 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



that great mission of the Church. I have had a very delightful 
time while laboring there. I realize that the mission is accom- 
plishing a great deal for the Church and for the people of the 

11 j been kd t0 sa ^ durin g m y missionary work in 

that land, that if this Church had made no other contribution to 
the great work of the Lord in the earth than its missionary sys- 
tem, it would be something that all the world might envy I 
realize that a great responsibility rests upon the Church in car- 
rying on this missionary work. When the Prophet Joseph re- 
ceived the glorious revelations that came to him, he also received 
a great responsibility, for the message was to be carried into all 
the world. 

After the crucifixion of our Lord, when he tarried anions his 
disciples, he said that unto him was given all power in heaven 
and upon earth. And he said, "Go ye into all the world and 
preach the gospel to every creature, baptizing them in the name 
of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost; and lo I 
am with you always even unto the end. of the world." I want 
to bear testimony to you this day that every day in our mission 
there are evidences that the Savior of the world has not forgotten 
the promise thus made to his disciples. I realize that those unto 
whom he spoke were not privileged to tarry until the end of the 
world, but those who have followed after, with the same divine

and a good sister there told me this story : She said she had a 
friend in that city who was a member of the Church, and this 
friend said that her grandfather was the one man in the county 
in which he resided in former days who would receive our 
Mormon missionaries in his home. One day her cousin said to 
his grandfather, "Grandfather, the next time those Mormon mis- 
sionaries come here if you receive them I will slap them in the 
face." And, she said, "True to his promise, the next time they 
came he did slap one of them but the Elder did not retaliate." She 
said, "That man's mind left him and he became an idiot, and he has 
been in the insane asylum ever since." 

I could stand here and relate to you for a long time the evi- 
dences that the Lord is with his missionaries guiding them in 
their work. I feel that it is a glorious privilege for our boys and 
girls to be engaged in this great work of the Master. I also want 
to bear testimony to you that it is improving their lives. A week 
ago last Monday, at a priesthood meeting at which a small group 
of missionaries were present, one missionary bore testimony that 
since his arrival in the field six months before, his father had 
started attending Sunday School and priesthood meeting, and he 
said that he had received a letter from his Bishop stating that the 
attendance at sacrament meeting had increased because heretofore 
they had not had a missionary out in the field for some time. An- 
other young man arose and said that during the six months he had 
been there, his father had mastered the habit of using tobacco to 
which he had been addicted for forty years. I wish it were pos- 
sible for every boy in this Church of proper age and proper con- 
duct, to have the privilege of going into the mission field. As I 
stand before you today and realize that 30 years ago this month 
I left my home to go on my first mission, and realize what a con- 
tribution that was to me and my life, I thank the Lord for that 
great privilege. I would not want a son of mine to live through 
mortality without having the privilege of doing the thing that I 
did. I would like him to know the joy and the thrill that come 
when one is privileged to bear testimony of the restoration of the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ to those who have not had the privilege of 
enjoying the blessings and the gifts of the Gospel. 

I know that the Lord is with his people. I know that the 
Lord is with the missionary work. I want to read to you just a 
few words in closing from the Prophet Joseph Smith — a vision 
that he saw in the Kirtland Temple January 21, 1836, the day 
upon which Father Smith was ordained a Patriarch. The Prophet 
Joseph saw in glorious vision his brother Alvin, David W. Pat- 
ten and others, in the Celestial kingdom, and these are the words 
he records in the Church History : 

I saw the: Twelve Apostles of the Lamb, who are now upon the earth 
who hold the keys of this last ministry, in foreign lands-, standing together 
in a circle, much fatigued, with their clothes tattered and feet swollen, with 



42 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



their eyes cast downward, and Jesus standing in their midst, and they did 
not behold Him. The Savior looked upon them and wept. 

I am sure that as we read the account of how the early 
apostles went forth to preach the Gospel, we can visualize them 
as the Prophet Joseph did, with their clothes tattered and their 
feet swollen, and the Savior of the world was there, according to 
his promise — "Lo, I will be with you always, even unto the end 
of the world." 

He said further: 

I also beheld Elder M'Lellin in the South, standing upon a hill, sur- 
rounded by a vast multitude preaching to them, and a lame man standing 
before him supported by his crutches; he threw them down at his word and 
leaped as a hart, by the mighty power of God. Also, I saw Elder Brigham 
Young standing in a strange land, in the far south and west, in a desert 
place, upon a rock in the midst of about a dozen men of color, who appeared 
hostile. He was preaching to them in their own tongue, and the angel of 
God standing above his head, with a drawn sword in his hand, protected 
him, but he did not see it. 

I want to testify to you, my brethren and sisters, that when 
your boys and girls go out into the ministry of the Lord the 
power of the Almighty God goes with them. He is raising up 
friends unto them on every hand. He is breaking down prejudice. 
He is opening the doors of the honest, and truly, as he said to 
the Seventies when he sent them forth, "He that receiveth you, 
receiveth me, and he that rejecteth you rejecteth me." Is it not 
a glorious privilege for our youth to go forth so endowed by 
the powers of heaven, so commissioned, and with the right and 
authority to speak in the name of the Lord? 

I pray the Lord's choicest blessings to be with his people 
throughout the world. It seems to me that a new day is dawn- 
ing; it seems almost as if the time were here when nations might 
be born into the Church over night. 

One of our missionaries sent this report a few days ago: He 
said he had had a long talk with a Methodist minister, and at 
the close of the conversation, the minister said, "My boy, you 
may have the very thing I have been looking for. I do not be- 
lieve the teachings of my church, nor have I taught them to my 
people. I have told my congregation repeatedly that I believe 
that in this day the God of heaven would send forth a Church 
different from anything else we know of today." 

What a glorious privilege to be able to bear testimony that 
the God of heaven has done that very thing, and that we do not 
have the work of man. I testify to this ; I know that God lives. 
I know that he hears and answers prayers. I know he is in this 
work. I know that Joseph Smith was a prophet of the true and 
living God. I leave that testimony in his name, Amen. 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH

ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

I am very grateful, my brethren and sisters, to be identified with 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It doesn't seem very 
long since I bore my first testimony. It was at the time of my baptism, 
or when I was being confirmed. I had been reared in a Latter-day 
Saint home and had been taught to pray by a devoted mother. I was 
made to understand that we are children of our Heavenly Father. Then 
I was baptized, when eight years of age, and became a member of the 
Church. And by the way, I was baptized in old City Creek on the north 
side of this block. 

a child's faith and understanding 

At the fast meeting that was held after I had been confirmed a 
member of the Church a dear old auntie, who long since has gone home, 
asked me, "Don't you want to bear your testimony?" I had heard 
others bear their testimonies, but I had never thought of bearing mine. 
I arose to my feet and I was just as sure then that I belonged to the 
Church of the Lamb of God as I am today. I was only a child, and that 
brings to my attention the fact that the Lord has given to our people a 
commandment that we are to teach our children to pray and to walk 
uprightly before him. He has said that parents in Zion having children 
shall teach them the Gospel of Jesus Christ and faith in God, and see 
that they are baptized and have the hands of the servants of God laid 
upon their heads for the bestowal of the Holy Ghost when eight years 
of age. And if we as parents fail in this duty the sin will be upon our 
heads. 

There are many people who have believed that it is not possible for 
children to understand at eight, but I stand here today as a witness that 
I had that understanding as far as it was possible for me as a child to 
know. 

THOSE WHO DILIGENTLY SEEK HIM 

We are living in a time when the world needs faith. Men and women 
throughout the length and breadth of this earth lack faith and they 
certainly lack understanding. The Lord in his mercy has given that 
to us and in the very first section of the Doctrine and Covenants, 
referred to here today, he warns us of the things that are to happen. He 
tells us of the difficulties that will arise, and later places upon the 
membership of this Church the obligation to divide with our Father's 
children the assurance of the blessings of eternal life. 

There are many great church organizations in the world, many 
devout men and women living according to the will of our Heavenly 
Father as they understand it. Reference was made by the preceding 
speaker to the faithful pastor of a church who believed that the Lord 
would speak to the world and would raise up His Church.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



All men who will live up to the light that the Lord has offered 
to them and seek him in earnest prayer will have their hearts touched, 
their minds will be influenced, and opportunity will be offered to 
them to know that God has spoken again. 

THE GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST 

When the Savior was upon the earth he went to and fro among the 
people, not with a loud voice, making a great noise, but in humility he 
went about blessing the children of men. His disciples too visited among 
the people, teaching and blessing them. The Gospel of Jesus Christ is 
a gospel of blessing, not a gospel of boasting, not a gospel of fault-finding 
and criticism, but a gospel of industry, purity, obedience, peace, love, 
chanty, kindness, faith and patience. Therefore, as members of his great 
Church we ought to be exemplars in this regard to all the world. 

TEACHING IN THE HOME 

I regret that there are among us some men and women who neglect 
their opportunities to live and teach the Gospel in their homes, and the 
result is that their children grow up without an assurance of the divine 
mission of Jesus Christ. They fail to observe the commandment that 
God gave to teach our children these things that are necessary. Fathers 
and mothers, teach your children as directed. What a joy it ought to be 
to you to teach your little children how to pray, to draw them near to our 
Heavenly Father, to let them feel the influence of his presence, to know 
that he can hear and answer prayer. What a joy it ought to be to the 
Latter-day Saints to gather around their own firesides and under the 
influence of family prayer call down the blessings of the Lord. 

THE TRUTH MADE MANIFEST 

The trouble with mankind today is that they are depending upon 
the wisdom of men. They are seeking the influence and association and 
direction of men who are teaching their own philosophies, and many of 
these philosophies are vain. The Lord offers to all of us opportunity to 
know his will, to know what our duty is in order that we may obtain 
eternal life. This is not a militant church to which we belong. This is a 
church that holds out peace to the world. It is not our duty to go into 
the world and find fault with others, neither to criticize men because they 
do not understand. But it is our privilege, in kindness and love, to go 
among them and divide with them the truth that the Lord has revealed in 
this latter day. 

How humble we ought to feel, not boastful ; how grateful we ought 
to teel, not selfish, when we realize that from among the millions of God's 
children we have been gathered, and the truth has been made manifest 
unto us and we are made to understand the purpose of life, to realize 
where we came from, why we are here, and the opportunities that God 
Has prepared for us to go hence and enjoy eternal life in the celestial 
kingdom. Ought that not to cause us to feel humble? And surely the 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 



45 



Spirit of God will be in our souls if in humility we desire to divide with 
our fellows the blessings of life. 

GREATER THAN SECULAR KNOWLEDGE 

A plea has been made by Brother Richards of the Southern States 
Mission that we send our sons and daughters into the mission field. We 
spend a very great deal of money giving them the opportunity for edu- 
cation in the secular institutions of the world. We feel it is a great privi- 
lege to have our boys and our girls graduate and receive a degree in the 
universities of •the world, and it is. But I say to you that there is no 
university that I know of in the world that will give to the human family 
the knowledge that God lives, that will plant in the lives of the children 
of men an assurance of eternal life, unless it be the one that belongs to 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. This is not because 
good men and good women do not desire to know. They do not and 
can not teach the Gospel because they have not received it. But we have 
received it, and with that reception there comes to us a tremendous respon- 
sibility. 

BLESSINGS THROUGH MISSIONARY SERVICE 

It has been a joy to me to see men and women economize and plan 
in order that their children may go into the world. Within the last few 
weeks a young man from an outlying settlement left to go into the 
mission field, and his two sisters who are employed here in Salt Lake City 
are sending him part of their small salaries that he may enjoy the blessing 
of a mission. He is the first of a large family of children to go into 
the mission field to disseminate the truth, and yet he is a descendant of 
those who received the Gospel from the early Elders of this Church. I 
know the joy that will come into the hearts of . those two fine women who 
have faith to give their means to their brother in order that he ma)' 
serve the Lord in the field. They will receive the blessing that comes 
from teaching the Gospel, as far as it is possible to receive it without 
personal service. 

As I go to and fro in the mission field I see the development of these 
fine young men and women who are unselfishly serving, and realize that 
not only do they learn the language of the countries in which they labor, 
but they know that they have a gift from the Lord to disseminate a truth 
that the people may not obtain in any other way. 

ALL MUST HEAR THE GOSPEL 

We are living in the latter days, in the time when the Lord said that 
the world would be afflicted by pestilence and earthquakes, that the sea 
should heave itself beyond its bounds, that there should be thunderings 
and lightnings, and wars and rumors of wars. Surely the scriptures are 
being fulfilled, but before the earth shall be cleansed and purified and 
prepared for the second coming of our Lord, his Gospel must be pro- 
claimed to all the nations of the earth. His sons and daughters must 



46 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



carry the message of life and salvation that means everything to those 
who are in darkness. 

Do we realize that every man is in the image of God and is a son of 
God, and every woman his daughter? No matter where they may be, 
they are his children, and he loves them and desires their salvation.' 
Surely as members of this Church we cannot sit idly by. We cannot 
receive the beneficent favor of our Heavenly Father that is bestowed 
upon us, the knowledge of eternal life, and selfishly retain it, thinking 
that we may be blessed thereby. It is not what we receive that enriches 
our lives, it is what we give. It is not the things that come to us without 
effort; it is that which results from work that rejoices our souls. 

THE PURPOSE OF THIS ASSEMBLAGE 

We are met in this marvelous tabernacle under the influence of the 
Spirit of the Lord, not as an ordinary convention ; we are .not assembled 
here to be taught by men the things that they have obtained in the schools 
of the. world, but we are here to wait upon our Father in heaven, your 
father and mine, the Father of our spirits, the Author of our being, the 
one who gives to us everything that we enjoy; and we are here to wait 
upon him knowing that he has promised us that if even two or three shall 
meet m his name he will be there, and that to bless them. 

Surely we have been blessed this day. The Spirit of God has been 
poured out upon us. My heart has been warmed and filled as I have 
looked out into this great audience to see men and women who have come 
trom the various parts of this great nation and some from other nations. 

I see now a group of our brothers and sisters from the far-off 
Hawaiian Islands who have come that long distance. Why ? In order 
that they may worship God at the headquarters of the Church, that they 
may partake of the inspiration of the Lord as it flows through his ser- 
vants who may be called to teach. I feel from the bottom of my heart 
to say, God bless you, my brethren and sisters, for making this long 
pilgrimage ; bless you all who have forsaken your homes temporarily and 
have come up to worship. You have not come for sight-seeing you have 
not come to partake of the influences that are found in the theatres and 
amusement halls of the world, but you have come up to worship. 

What a priceless privilege to worship our Father in heaven in the 
name of Jesus Christ, his Son ! Ought we not to be grateful ? It seems 
to me that as I look into your eager, upturned faces and realize what the 
Lord has done for you and for me, there are no words of mine that can 
adequately express the feelings of our hearts as we are filled by that 
power that comes from him. 

I know that God lives. I know that Jesus is the Christ. I know that 
this is the work of our Heavenly Father, established by his beloved Son. 

ZrlLl T ,t 6 V n f gfeat C T hurch or ? aniz aitons and in all schools of 
learning truth is taught, yet I do know that all the truth that is 
possessed by all of them that is necessary in preparation for eternal life 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 



47 



in the celestial kingdom is a part of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, our Lord, 
and has been bestowed upon us, if we have the desire to receive it. 

THE IMPORTANCE OF SACRED MUSIC 

We have listened to sweet voices that have entertained and entranced 
us. I think it is delightful to hear as we have a chorus of "Singing 
Mothers." And it is pleasing also to have a chorus of singing fathers 
in the priesthood quorums. I am grateful for a Church that teaches the 
joy and encourages the sweet influences that come from music. So im- 
portant are the hymns of the Church that our Heavenly Father appointed 
the Prophet's wife Emma to select hymns that were appropriate for 
sacred services. We do have excellent hymns in this Church. Even our 
Primary children, beginning in their tender years, are taught not only 
to sing the songs of the world, but they are taught to sing the praises 
of our Heavenly Father and to give thanksgiving in the music that is 
prepared. What a comforting, uplifting influence there is in music. 

AN INCIDENT IN THE SOUTHERN STATES * 

Brother LeGrand Richards has spoken for the Southern States 
Mission. Many years ago, two humble Elders laboring in that mission 
were walking through the woods and finally came out into a clearing 
where nestled a humble cottage, the home of friends. Overlooking this 
clearing was a hill covered by large trees. It had been a warm day. When 
the Elders arrived, instead of sitting in the house they took their chairs 
out on the shady porch to visit with the family. They didn't know that 
they were being watched or that danger threatened. They were there as 
servants of the Lord. They had come through a section of the country 
that was unfriendly and having found a home where the family was 
friendly they were grateful to the Lord for it. 

They were asked to sing and they selected one of our hymns, "Do 
What is Right." You know the hymn. And as they sang it, even as 
they started to sing it, there arrived on the brow of the hill above them 
a mob of twenty horsemen. They had come there with the determination 
to drive those missionaries out. As they came to the top of the hill they 
heard those missionaries singing. The leader of the mob got off his horse. 
He looked down among those trees and saw the roof of the house. He 
could not see the Elders. They continued to sing. One by one the men 
got off their horses. Gradually they removed their hats, and when the 
last note had died away and the Elders had finished their singing the 
men mounted their horses and rode away, and the leader said to his 
companions, "Men who sing like that are not the kind of men we have 
been told they are." 

OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO DISSEMINATE THE TRUTH 

My brethren and sisters, this is God's work, established for the salva- 
tion and exaltation not of a few but for all men and all women who will 
accept it, preparing us for a place in the celestial kingdom, offering op- 



48 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



portunity for all our Father's sons and daughters eventually to dwell 
with him. 

Now, knowing that and realizing the responsibility of disseminating 
that truth among the children of men, how anxious you ought to be, how 
anxious I ought to be that my own household be in order, that the mem- 
bers of that household be prepared, if they are called upon, to go to the 
uttermost corners of the earth and disseminate this truth, to the end that 
men and women may know of a surety that God lives and that we are 
all his children. 

Think of the difference between hope and knowledge; think of the 
difference between desire to know and positive assurance. Our Heavenly 
father has promised us that if we will receive the ordinances of his Holv 
House, if we will partake of the influences that come as a result of 
obedience to his Gospel, we may know, as we know that we live, that God 
lives, that Jesus is the Christ, that his work is upon the earth and that we 
are preparing ourselves here for eternal happiness ; or if we fail to take 
advantage of our opportunities, for eternal regret. 

IN OUR OWN COMMUNITIES 

Brethren and sisters, you who live in the organized stakes of Zion 
when you go home from this conference take with you the spirit that you 
find here If there be those who are careless, renew your efforts and en- 
courage them to live the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Inconvenience your- 
selves, if necessary, to bring those who are careless and indifferent into 
close contact with the worship of the Lord as carried out in our chapels 
and temples. Let us do this earnestly. 

The time is short. Not very many years remain for some of us in 
mortality If we are to do the work of the Lord we must be about our 
1'ather s business. There isn't a man here, not a woman here but is called 
to labor, to do good m the world and to bless the communities in which 
we live. Oh, how happy we will be if we avail ourselves of our oppor- 
tunities and serve our Heavenly Father by serving mankind. 

GRATEFUL FOR PRIVILEGES 

God bless you, my brethren and sisters. I thank you for the comfort 
and satisfaction that you have given to me. I am grateful for the privilege 
I have of mingling with you in your homes and in the houses of worship 
throughout the land. 

President Grant, I am grateful to you and to my brethren here for 
the privilege that I have of associating with you, each and every one for 
he encouragement and the help that you give to me. God bless 'you 
brethren from the mission fields. You have a marvelous work to perform 
and our Heavenly Father will magnify you and bless vou in proportion to 
your faithfulness. 

I pray that the Lord will bless us all, that we may be worthy of our 
high cabling and the opportunities that he has offered to us as fathers 
<md_ mothers, as parents and children. Let us be what God would have 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 



49 



us be and Zion will arise and shine and our Heavenly Father will multi- 
ply our opportunities and blessings. 

Not very long from now the summons will reach every one of us. 
Our earth life will be complete and we will stand on the other side of the 
Great Divide. Oh, how I pray that when that time comes we shall face 
our record unashamed and unafraid because we have magnified our call- 
ings and been worthy of our membership in this Church. 

That the Lord may add his blessing, I humbly pray, in the name 
of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER RUFUS K. HARDY 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

My beloved brethren and sisters, I have had the feeling today, 
somewhat, that I had many years ago ; in fact, when I was a 
child I stood here in this building; then the experience of childish 
humility which comes from having made mistakes, overwhelmed 
me. 

Brother Evan Stephens had four boys who he thought could 
sing, and so he made a quartet. Those four boys were Heber Al- 
dous, Horace Ensign, Zeb Jacobs and myself. He had told the 
other three that they should repeat the chorus, but he didn't tell 
me. So when the chorus was sung once I turned around and took 
my seat, and the other three were left standing. I felt so humiliated 
that that finished my aspirations in the line of vocal music. 

I am grateful and indeed happy for the privilege of being 
here and partaking of the spirit of this conference and the splendid 
influence which is here with us. I know that some of you have 
traveled many miles and made sacrifice to reach this place, and 
there keeps coming into my mind the thought of the old Jewish 
pilgrims who anciently went to their synagogues, a people who 
were beset with privations, misfortune, torment, all manner of 
humiliation, and as they went to their temples, they tried to divest 
themselves of those thoughts which tended to take their minds 
from the worship which they intended to perform. It is claimed 
that on the soles of their sandals, the soles of their shoes, these old 
Jews wrote the name of their enemy and in walking to their syna- 
gogue left the name and also the memory of that which had per-- 
plexed them, in the dust, and so sat and worshiped with a clean 
heart and a free, untrammeled mind. 

We may do the same here. We may leave behind us those 
little besetting, annoying things that would take our minds from 
the important issues of this blessed conference and this great gath- 
ering, that we may do that which we have set out to do, worship 
God and his Son Jesus Christ; that we may worship that Christ 
who came from glory, came from the realms above, from the celes- 
tial courts, to be born here on earth in a manger amid humble, 



50 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



meek and lowly circumstances ; that Christ who went forth and in 
his power and in his majesty healed the sick, protected the weak, 
befriended the helpless ; that Christ who with just a word accom- 
plished what no physician has yet accomplished. 

You recall the leper who came to him and said "If thou wilt 
thou canst make me clean." Christ said: "I will; be thou clean." 
Instantly the leper was healed, and went his way rejoicing. 
Thousands of institutions have been established in the world for 
the purpose of taking care of incurables ; but one word from Christ, 
and there were no incurables— the Christ who left his message in 
word of mouth and in action; the Christ who, on that hill, the 
mount, has declared that unto us which shall ever live and 'ever 
ring in our ears, his Sermon on the Mount; the Christ who took 
the ordinary things of life, and around them wove truth, such won- 
derful, glorious truths that today they live. 

You think of the foxes and you think of Christ. You think 
even of the bird, a little gray sparrow, and you think of Christ. 
There comes to your mind this statement : "Are not two sparrows 
sold for a farthing?" Then, too, the lilies of the field, when we see 
them as we may be carelessly going our way, instinctively we 
think : "They toil not, neither do they spin." The Christ with whom 
even his enemies could find no fault, and having tried him, washed 
well their hands of him. Then through that great Jewish mob, 
there came one rushing to Pilate with a message. That message 
said : "Have thou nothing to do with that just man, for I have suf- 
fered many things this day in a dream because of him"— a message 
from Pilate's wife. 

And when, as he hung upon the cross, the one who ordered 
the nails driven into his feet and his hands, the one who gave his 
order to pierce his side with the sword, said : "Truly this man was 
the son of God." 

That is why we have come here today to worship Jesus Christ 
and his Father, our God. But beyond that there is just this that 
makes us a peculiar people : You will recall the angel's voice to the 
shepherds, and the encouraging words : "Fear not, for unto you is 
born this day in the city of David a Savior which is Christ the 
Lord. How even the angels of God spoke concerning this man, 
Jesus Christ. 

You will remember the testimony of God at his baptism, as he 
arose from the water, the voice from heaven: "This is my beloved 
Son, in whom I am well pleased." The whole world believes this, 
and the world accepts it gladly, and yet hesitates only when we 
boldly go the one step farther and say that in 1820 the same voice 

I ™* the .? at < fe!'. ran ^ in the ears of th e boy Joseph Smith, and 
the Father said: "This is my beloved Son. Hear Him." From the 
messages which he received there has arisen this great institution, 
this mighty work which has spread into every corner of the world. 
I he word has gone forth that over and beyond the Christian be- 
lief m God and his Son Jesus Christ, the Mormons believe that 



ELDER RUFUS K. HARDY 



51 



again God has appeared and Jesus Christ has spoken. Therein lies 
the strength of our faith. 

Let us continuously bear this message to all the world, in hu- 
mility, in meekness, and in faith, relying upon the Lord, that he 
may bless us, that this work may grow, and spread, and increase ; 
that the missionary effort which is being put forth in every nook 
and corner of this earth shall be prospered abundantly, even as I 
know it is being blessed in that far-away land of New Zealand, 
among that splendid race of men and women, those noble people, 
the Maoris, who are working daily and hourly as messengers of 
this restored Gospel of Jesus Christ, and also their brothers and 
sisters from Hawaii, these splendid souls whom Brother Smith has 
referred to, who not only faced the dangers of the sea but also of 
the land, that they might be here with us to worship God the 
Father and Jesus Christ, the Son, and to bear testimony of the 
divine mission of the prophet Joseph Smith. God bless them all. 

May God bless you, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

It may be of interest to all of you to know that we have decided to 
organize a stake of Zion in the Hawaiian Islands. 

"Great is Jehovah," an anthem, was sung by the Relief Society Sing- 
ing Mothers, Jessie Williams, soloist. 

Elder James Duckworth, President of the Blackfoot Stake, offered 
the closing prayer. 

Conference adjourned until 10 :00 a. m., April 6.

In retiring they do so with the love, confidence, blessing, good will, 
and deep gratitude of the First Presidency and members of the Council 
of the Twelve Apostles. All of you who feel to sustain the release of 
these men and to give to them our love and blessing in their retiring, will 
'manifest it by raising the right hand. 

(The vote was then taken.) 

I can announce, as I have always done in the past, that the voting 
has been unanimous. 

ELDER REED SMOOT 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

I pray for the blessings of our Heavenly Father while I stand 
before you this morning. I realize my weaknesses, but I want to 
assure you, my brethren and sisters, I never cease asking my Heaven- 
ly Father for his kindness, his revelations to me, that I may fulfil 
every requirement made at my hands, affecting his great, cause here 
upon this earth. 

'GIFTS FROM GOD 

How often I have heard the expression, particularly during the 
terrible depression we are passing through, that "Life is not worth 
living or striving for." Think of the many horrible suicides as re- 
ported by the press of the country. How many live a lifetime and 
never think that life is a precious gift from our Heavenly Father. 
He is the giver of all that makes life worth living. Are we as Latter- 
day Saints appreciative of God's mercies and protecting care from 
the first appearance of the Father and Son to the boy Joseph 
Smith? Some are, others are not. Oh Father, assist us all to ap- 
preciate these things. 

The surest way to please our Heavenly Father is to put into 
action the commandments of the Father, and make them a part of 
our daily life, no matter where we are or with whom we are associ- 
ated. Never be afraid to let the world, if necessary, know that you 
are a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
I have never, to my knowledge, lost the respect of a single person 
by my unqualified statement that I am a member of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 

STRIVING TOWARD PERFECTION 

Perfection in this life or world is impossible for mortal man, 
but we must employ every power we possess to reach it as near as 
possible. 

How often do we hear people rail at what they call fate. It is 



56 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



my opinion that we receive just what we make the proper use of. 
Let me quote the following: 

Fame, place and title finding a fitting use 
And rightfully demand all reverence due. 
But envy not the empty lot of man 
Who, winning without merit, wins in vain. 
Greatness, true greatness, mightiness of mind, 
And greater greatness, grandeur of the soul, 
Tell but one tale — capacity, not place. 
Capacity, whose sire, experience, 
Whose ancestors, innate intelligence, 
Original, inborn nobility, 
As oft in hut as mansion have their home. 

The more we strive to accomplish a thing, 'be it right or wrong, 
the more chance we have of success. This same principle applies 
to every action in life. 

THE EMPLOYMENT SITUATION 

I have wondered, my brethren and sisters, what is going to 
be the ultimate outcome of the dreadful conditions existing in the 
world today, covering nearly every civilized country, drawing from 
all sources the resources of nations ; and I am quite sure that with- 
out the assistance of God, the Eternal Father, chaos would be the 
end. Suffering in the world,— I doubt whether there ever was a 
time that it was so widespread. 

I noticed in a government report the other day that there are 
23,375,000 on relief in our country. That means that one person 
out of every five in our country is on relief today. This is an in- 
crease of 77 per cent, over a year ago. Yet business is at the same 
level as last April. 

The nation's workers in normal times total 50,000,000. Sub- 
tract our present army of 6,000,000 federal state and local govern- 
ment employes, and the 10,000,000 workers who are now jobless, and 
we havq 34,000,000 working in private industry in all of America— 
a startling statement, and yet it comes from the Government of the 
United States and cannot be questioned. 

FOREIGN OBLIGATIONS 

I thought that following the World War our government never 
would be placed in such a position again, I mean financially. With 
between eleven and twelve billions of dollars that our government 
advanced to the foreign countries involved in that war, at the close 
of the war it was owing $26,187,000,000, a sum unknown to the world 
before. 

It is true that between eleven and twelve billions of that amount 
was advanced to the countries involved in that war in which we 
assisted. I was a member of the committee that made the settle- 
ments with all the foreign countries that had received assistance

from America during that great catastrophe. The settlements were 
made upon a basis of their ability to pay : Italy, 17 per cent of what 
she owed us, and we gave her sixty-two years, as we gave all of the 
other countries, in which to pay back their obligations to our coun- 
try. Belgium 40 per cent, England 82]/ 2 per cent,— and I might 
go along the list, but it was all the way from 17 per cent to S2]/^ per 
cent, according to the showing that each made to the committee, and 
the committee used its best judgment in arranging the settlements. 

Of course England and France were the ones that owed the 
Government of the United States the most, — and the settlement was 
made upon a basis less than par — France, 51 per cent, England 82 ^ 
per cent ; and then, my brothers and sisters, they were given sixty- 
two years to meet these obligations, and yet every one of those coun- 
tries has failed to carry out the contract! 

OUR FINANCIAL BURDEN 

What other nation in the world would have been so liberal? 
None, I assure you. The financial burden fell upon us, and it reached 
a deficit of $26,000,000,000, notwithstanding the heavy taxes imposed 
during the war period. I was chairman of the Finance Committee 
and senior member of the Appropriations Committee, — the one to 
raise the money, the other to expend it ; — and that obligation was re- 
duced to $16,000,000,000, at the time the present depression began. 

I am not finding any fault or criticising what has been done, but 
T want to say to you, my brethren and sisters, that our obligations 
are such now that I, of course, never will live long enough to see them 
paid, nor will a soul in this congregation. They aimount approxi- 
mately to $35,000,000,000 ! 

I know some people speak flippantly of a billion dollars. Do you 
know what $35,000,000,000 means ? I have been asked so many 
times, and once in public life I made the statement — at that time our 
indebtedness had reached $26,000,000,000— that if there were an 
unknown power who had an unknown receptacle, and that unknown 
power decided that it would, the very minute the Savior was born, 
place $26.00 in that unknown receptacle, and had continued to place 
in it $26.00 every minute from the minute the Savior was' born until 
the time the settlement was made with the United States, we would 
have about $26,000,000,000. 

LIVE WITHIN YOUR MEANS 

I do hope and trust that we Latter-day Saints will live up to 
the instructions that we have heard so often from this, stand, by 
every President of this Church ; that is, to live within our means 
and keep out of debt. It is a hard thing to do, particularly if we live 
on the plane that has been set so high, I was going to say, in modern 
days ; but to have peace of mind, happiness within the home, con- 
fidence among yourselves, keep out of debt; live within your means;

and I know of no people anywhere that can do it so well as the Lat- 
ter-day Saints, if they will. 

GREAT FAITH DEMONSTRATED 

I have had a great deal of pleasure, my brethren and sisters, in 
visiting the different stakes of Zion, during the last two years. I 
doubt whether there ever has been a time when there has been more 
faith demonstrated by the people of the Church than today, unless, per- 
chance, it was during the early history of the Church, when the 
Prophet Joseph Smith and those noble men associated with him 
were called upon to sacrifice more than any other people since the 
days of the Master. 

My prayer always is, it always shall be if God grants me the 
desire of my heart, that his people, members of his Church, shall be 
honorable, honest and upright ) not only with men but with God 
himself. The plan of the Father is such that his work can be taken 
care of. There is no such organization in all the world. It was not 
many years ago when one of the great men of this country made the 
statement that the two greatest organizations in 'the world were the 
Mormon Church and the German army. I have thought so many 
times, — and did the very first time I heard it, — one for the salvation 
of the children of God, the other for the destruction of life and liberty. 
How proud we should be that we are members of God's Church. 

SUSTAIN THE PRESIDENCY 

Brethren and sisters, may I ask of you that you support the 
Presidency of this Church. I testify to you that they are men of God. 
I know that they are true to the Church, that they would sacrifice, 
if necessary, their very lives for its existence. Other men have done 
this, and there never will be a time when that will not be the case. 
God grant that it may never become 'necessary. 

I know that I echo your thoughts and your feelings and your 
prayers when I say to this audience, and all who may be listening in, 
let us uphold the hands of the Presidency of the Church, pray for 
them and sustain them and be with them ; and also men holding 
responsible positions in the stakes of Zion, in the wards, in the 
branches and in the mission field. 

May God's blessings ever attend his work and may it increase 
in power for good in the world. With these expressions, my breth- 
ren and sisters, I pray that God's blessings may ever be yours, and 
I do it in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

I think the music we have heard by our Hawaiian brethren 
and sisters has been very beautiful. It came from the heart, and 



ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 



59 



indicates how these people respond to the truth as expressed in 
our sacred hymns. You realize, my brethren and sisters, that 
these people of the Hawaiian Islands are of the blood of Israel. 
These islands were discovered in 1778 by Captain James Cook, 
who has left a remarkable description of them in his Journal 
which has been printed in seven volumes. Although the old 
British sea-captain, one of the greatest explorers of all history, 
was killed by the natives of the islands, he ascribes to them, 
nevertheless, fine qualities and noble beliefs. He writes on one 
occasion : 

I have never met with a behaviour so free from reserve and sus- 
picion in my intercourse with any tribes of s-avages, as we experienced in 
the people of this island. It was- very common for them to send up into 
the ship several articles they brought off for barter; afterward they would 
come ini themselves, and make their bargains on the quarter-deck. 

In the early part of the nineteenth century, Christian mission- 
aries went among the Hawaiians, and it was not long before the 
old pagan religions were overthrown, and the people readily em- 
braced Christianity. Their ancient folk-lore and traditions sug- 
gest deep and fundamental beliefs of the Israelites of ages ago. 
One tradition tells of a young chief who was taken to the land 
of his fathers, but one day coming back from the clouds, he 
warned his people to wage war no longer, but to live in peace 
and to cleanse their thoughts and bodies by going into the river. 
Then they should know if they are clean. After giving the mes- 
sage, the young chief floated off "to the land of departed souls." 

It does our hearts good to see you, our good brothers and 
sisters from far-off Hawaii, and I believe that you will do a great 
work among your native people in having them see the restored 
Gospel of our Savior. 

The Prophet Jeremiah wrote on one occasion : 

Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths, where is 
the good way, and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your souls. 

We are all agreed, from what we have heard in the confer- 
ence, that what we need today are simpler manners and purer 
ways of living. The only salvation for this nation is the putting 
away of idolatry, and the bringing about of the revival of faith 
in the true and living God. 

It is written in the 19th Chapter of I Kings : 

And, behold, the Lord passed by, and a great and strong wind rent 
the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the Lord; but the 
Lord was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but the Lord 
was not in the earthquake: 

And after the earthquake a fire; but the Lord was not in the fire: 
and after the fire a still small voice. 

We are losing, in the world, the still small voice that every 
child of God is naturally blessed with. Today in the world's 
chaotic condition we are confronted with many problems, the 



60 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



greatest of which is how to teach the youth. The crying need of 
the hour is that youth be taught that life has a meaning, and a 
meaning for good. Life is nothing without the supreme faith in 
goodness and truth, inspired with a faith in Almighty God. 

The three institutions of civilization that are responsible for 
the education of the youth are the home, the school and the 
Church. The home must always be the main source of edu- 
cation for the youth. Count Tolstoi, the Russian writer, once 
wrote, "Where love is, God is also." In every home, love must 
abound, and the obtaining of the Spirit of God must be the first 
aim of parents and children. We sneer at times gone by. We 
speak unkindly of the good old Puritans and Quakers who came 
to America centuries ago to find religious freedom. There may 
have beenrnuch iron in the Puritan temper, but their homes had 
a foundation, and the virile virtues were in those homes. As 
for the schools, colleges, and universities of our land, I some- 
times think that too much attention is given to facts and formu- 
las at the expense of the greater fundamentals of truth. It was 
Henry Van Dyke who once said that we often learn facts, but 
miss the truth. After all, the fundamental of all knowledge is 
expressed in the Book of Moses, of the Pearl of Great Price. The 
prophet of old is led to say: 

And as one earth shall pass away, and the heavens thereof, even so 
shall another come; and there is no end to my works, neither to my 
words. 

For behold, this is my work and my glory — to bring to pass the 
immortality and eternal life of man. 

The Prophet Jeremiah must have referred to some very fun- 
damental truths of life when he wrote : "Stand ye in the ways, 
and see, and ask for the old paths." He may have been speaking 
to the youth of his day and calling their attention to the moral 
and spiritual values that are to be first sought after in life. One 
thing is certain, he would emphasize the teachings of the divine 
leader Moses as found in the immortal Ten Commandments, 
which truths are as important today as they have ever been in 
human history. Think of the divine injunction : "Thou shalt have 
no other Gods before me." Are we as teachers substituting for 
the Father of us all, and his Only Begotten Son, teachings that 
are not leading us to God? I ask this question in all candor. Is 
the world coming to worship the god of ambition, the god of war, 
the god of gold? Children and youth today, as they have always 
been, are precious in the sight of God. Can they be led to any- 
thing of richer spiritual value than the proper observance of the 
Sabbath day, to keep it holy and sacred? The laws of ancient 
Israel taught that it is wrong to steal, wrong to bear false wit- 
ness against our neighbor. Are not these truths the deep and 
underlying principles of living? They are. The youth of today 
needs them as much as any other time in all history. Such truths

He at the root of all good government — both religiously and polit- 
ically. 

Then there are the ethical teachings of Jesus Christ our Lord, 
as embodied in the Sermon on the Mount. The sayings of the 
Master rise to the greatest heights of all teachings : 

And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain; and when he 
was set, his disciples came unto him: 

And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying, 

Blessed are the poor in spirit: for their's is the kingdom of heaven. 

Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted. 

Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth. 

Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for 
they shall be filled. 

Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy. 

Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God. 

Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of 

God. 

. Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for 
their's is the kingdom of heaven. 

Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and 
.shall &ay all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake. 

Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: 
tor so persecuted they the prophets which were before you. 

The greatest sermon ever given is the Sermon on the Mount, 
and among the many things Jesus tells us is that we are to be pure 
in heart, then shall we see God; and not only see God, but we 
shall live and understand life in its beauty and in its true mean- 
ing. 

What the world needs is the purifying thought that we lay 
deeper foundations for learning than we have ever done before. 
I remember at Harvard College in one of the classes in philoso- 
phy the old philosopher, William James, said one morning: 

Neither laurels nor monuments, neither battleships nor public li- 
braries, nor great newspapers nor universities can save us from degenera- 
tion if the inner mystery be lost. 

Are we losing the inner mystery, the inner mystery that tells 
the boy and girl that there are things belonging to the creations 
of God that they can only understand by faith in him? Paul 
gave us this admonition in his words when he said to the Phil- 
ippians : 

Whatsoever _ things- are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatso- 
ever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are 
lovely . . . think on these things. 

In that lovely story of Tom Brown's school days, which pos- 
sibly you have read, you remember what old Squire Brown said 
when his son went up to college at Rugby: 

I do not care a straw for Greek particles, or the diagamma. If he 
will only turn out a brave, helpful, truth-telling Englishman, and a Chris- 
tian, that's all I want. 

On the old library at Columbia University are these words 



62 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



chiselled above the main entrance: "Maintained and cherished 
from generation to generation for the advancement of the public 
good, and the glory of Almighty God." 

These words reminded me that years ago there were in the 
University of Utah and in the Brigham Young University some 
great educators, just as there are noble educators today in the 
same institutions, and the same may be said of the Agricultural 
College at Logan. I come to this question of teaching because 
we have had great men in this state as educators who understood 
the youth, and who taught that knowledge should be conducive to 
a knowledge of God and an understanding of greater faith in him 
and in life. John R. Park, who was, in a sense, the father of the 
University of Utah and Karl G. Maeser of the Brigham Young 
University directed the lives of the youth for years, and no 
greater teachers ever lived. It was Dr. Maeser who once said: 
"You can teach the multiplication table with the Spirit of God." 
There was William M. Stewart who understood the little child, 
and knew above all things his nature, and the beauty of his 
character and soul. There was George H. Brimhall, an ideal 
teacher. I could name many other men who knew the dreams of 
youth and who understood them. 

There have been great educators in all America. I think no 
greater educator ever lived than William James of Harvard, who 
used to say to us that after all knowledge is but opening up the 
great mystery of life, that we may know that something still 
greater lies beyond. 

There is a story told that a small company of boys had in- 
fringed the rules of the University when Dr. John R. Park was 
president. Realizing their misdemeanor they went to the office 
of the president and told him all about it. The face of the old 
gentleman and the scholar filled with an expression of deep 
pleasure at their honesty. The smile went from his mouth and 
his eyes filled with tears as he thanked the boys for their cour- 
tesy in coming to him. So all great teachers— and we are all 
teachers — every brother and sister in this congregation is a 
teacher — direct their students first to religious and moral princi- 
ples, secondly to gentlemanly conduct, and the intellectual ability. 
The chief end of all teaching is to make the youth love the truth 
for truth's sake, and the principle of right because it is right. 

"We the truthful," was a noble saying of the Greek aristoc- 
racy, which remains to this day. As teachers we must go forth 
to teach. The Priesthood of God is a great band of teachers. 
You missionaries are teachers. We must bring the students to 
the ideal that there is such a thing as moral health "as beautiful 
and desirable as health of body; and that a sign of it is perfect 
truthfulness, sincerity, kindness, helpfulness, self-control, courage, 
and the fulfilment of duty." Then life's meaning will be clear 
and their days will be spent in joy and in peace.

The good old days remain with us, for what was right once 
always remains right; what was the truth once always remains 
truth. We learn about Abraham Lincoln, of the battles that were 
fought during the Civil War, the things that were done in a 
political and social way ; but let us direct our boys and girls in 
our history courses — in all of our work — to the great fundamental 
ideal of life and the men who exemplify it in our time. 

Abraham Lincoln issued a Thanksgiving Day proclamation, 
and in this he stressed his sublime faith in God. I read a part of 
this proclamation : 

Proclamation of a National Fast-Day, August 12, 1861 
ABRAHAM LINCOLN 

. . . Whereas it is fit and becoming in all people at all times, to ac- 
knowledge and revere the supreme government of God; to bow in humble 
submission to his chastisements, to confess and deplore their sins and 
transgressions, in the full conviction that the fear of the Lord is the be- 
ginning of wisdom; and to pray with all fervency and contrition for 
the pardon of their past offenses, and for a blessing upon their present and 
prospective action: 

And whereas when our own beloved country, once, by the blessing of 
God, united, prosperous, and happy, is now afflicted with faction and civil 
war, it is peculiarly fit for us to recognize the hand of God in this terrible 
visitation, and in sorrowful remembrance of our own faulits and crimes as- a 
nation and as individuals, to humble ourselves before him and to pray for 
his mercy — to pray that we be spared further punishment, though most 
justly deserved; that our arms may be blessed and made effectual for the 
reestablishment of law, order, and peace throughout the wide extent of our 
country; and that the inestimable boon of civil and religious liberty, earned 
under his guidance and blessing by the labors and blessings of our fathers 
may be restored in all its original excellence, 

I do earnestly recommend to all people, and especially to all ministers 
and teachers of religion, and all heads of families, to observe and keep that 
day . _ . . in all humility and with all religious solemnity, to the end that 
the united prayer of the nation may ascend to the Throne of Grace, and 
bring down plentiful blessings upon our country. 

Signed: ABRAHAM LINCOLN. 

America needs today a youth that is disciplined, who has 
self-respect and powers for productive service. The world needs 
a youth possessed of the highest standards of intellectual morali- 
ty. We need teachers who are learned, and in whom there is a 
balance of faculties and a deep sympathy: men and women full 
of power and warm and true of heart, men of deep devotion and 
self-forgetfulness. Jesus emphasized the blessed truth that the 
pure in heart should see God. They shall comprehend all truth. 
The Ten Commandments, the Sermon on the Mount, with the 
underlying faith in his gift of salvation, are the greatest precepts 
for the youth of today to learn. And now for us all, let us be 
comforted in the beautiful words from Leviticus: 

If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them- 
lhen will I give you rain in due season, and the land shall yield her 
increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit

And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage 
shall reach unto the sowing time: and ye shall eat your bread to the full, 
and dwell in your land safely. 

And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none 
shall make you afraid: and I will rid evil beasts out of the land, neither shall 
the sword go through your land. 

May the Lord help us to understand these lovely and divine 
truths. May he give us the, light and power to help the youth to 
see them, this glorious youth, whose problems are many and whose 
questions are deep. May the spirit of the love of Christ abound 
in our hearts for all mankind, I ask in his name. Amen. 

An anthem, "Lord, What is Man ?" was sung by the Manti Choir, 
duet by V era Keller and Thera Lou Olson. 

ELDER RUDGER CLAWSON 

President of the Council of the Tzvelve Apostles 

My brethren and sisters, I have been thrilled with the proceed- 
ings of this conference. The Lord bless President Grant and those 
brethren who have already spoken, for the good things they have said 
to us ; and the Lord bless those who will follow for the good things 
that they will speak to us, because we know if they do speak it will 
be the truth. 

The Lord bless the Manti choir for the very fine singing they 
have contributed to this general conference. It is praiseworthy and 
most fitting. 

The Lord bless the small group of Hawaiians who have come 
a long distance to meet with us, who are listening attentively to what 
is being said. The Lord bless them also for their sweet singing. 

The Lord bless the Singing Mothers who have sung so beauti- 
fully for us. At times they might easily be mistaken for the Taber- 
nacle Choir. The Lord bless them because they are not only good 
singers but they are "singing mothers." The Lord bless other moth- 
ers, if only they are mothers. And may the Lord bless! the "singing 
fathers," if they can be found. I am sure there are many of them 
among the Latter-day Saints. 

THE IMPORTANCE OF MOTHERHOOD AND FATHERHOOD 

The women of our faith are doing a wonderful work in the Relief 
Society and in the Young Ladies' organization. It is marvelous, 
the things that they are accomplishing, but let me tell you the great- 
est achievement, one of the greatest, at least, if not the greatest 
achievement that ever comes to a woman in this life is to become a 
mother in Israel. That- is a noble, a most sacred and great achieve- 
ment. And no greater work ever comes to a father than to become 
a father in Israel. It is said that one mother rather disparaged her 
husband before their son Willie. Willie said to his mother. "Mother, 



ELDER RUDGER CLAWSON 



65 



if you will give me ten cents I will be good," and the mother said : 
"Now, Willie, why can't you be like your father. He isn't good for 
ten cents. He is good for nothing." As to the fathers, well, they 
had better hang around, because if there were no fathers there 
wouldn't be any mothers, and if there were no mothers there 
wouldn't be any fathers. The Lord in heaven arranged it so. 

THE MYSTERY AND PURPOSE OF LIFE 

We have heard some significant references at this conference 
to the mystery of life, and certainly there is a mystery and a pur- 
pose in life. But let me tell you, the great scientists of the world, 
the great philosophers of the world and the greatest teachers of the 
world have not as yet discovered the mystery of life. They are reach- 
ing out for it but they haven't yet found it. 

Now, it might be thought that I am a little presumptuous if I 
should say the Latter-day Saints have actually discovered the very 
purpose of life but I do say it and my assertion is true. "Well," says 
one, "how imay that have been possible? What is the purpose of 
life?" Let me point it out to you briefly, but before I do so I would 
like to read to you a few words by a writer who is reputed to be 
something of a philosopher. His name is Anatole France and this 
excerpt is taken from a work entitled : "Conversations with Anatole 
France," a French writer. 

OPINIONS OF A FRENCH WRITER 

"And what of the joys of the intellect?" said I. "Ah, the intellect again, always 
the intellect. But it is just that — the intellect, the mind — that gives us the measure 
of the nullity of others, and of ourselves. What joy have you in mind? The 
comf orting thought that we know not whence we come nor whither we are going, 
that life, which is a state of 'slavery, an insoluble enigma, is also the most pitiable, 
the most unstable and the most transient of all the things whereof we have cog- 
nizance? The bewildering thought that we inhabit aitiny drop in the great stream 
of the Milky Way which is certainly but an insignificant rivulet of the Cosmos, 
that we shall disappear in a moment and the whole human race with us, to be fol- 
lowed by the other planetary and stellar processions which, if they linger a little 
longer, will inevitably perish in their turn ?" 

WHEN THE ALMIGHTY SPEAKS 

My brethren and sisters, you cannot get one word of comfort 
from these words. It is a most discouraging and gloomy picture of 
life. But then on the other hand we know something of the purpose 
of life ; especially is it so when the Almighty Father speaks through 
the scriptures and by revelation and gives us the word. The great 
men of the earth, if only they would turn to the scriptures and open 
their hearts and exercise faith in a spirit of humility and ask the 
Lord about the purpose of life, he would tell them, as he has told the 
Latter-day Saints. 

We have learned that in the life of man there are three estates, 
and that the first was our preexistent estate which was wholly spirit- 



66 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ual ; that the second estate is the spiritual and temporal, or mortal, 
combined; and that'the third estate is the glorification of the spirit- 
ual and the temporal through the resurrection. There you have it 
briefly. A careful inquiry into these three estates will discover the 
secret of life which has baffled humanity during long centuries of the 
past. 

THE FIRST ESTATE 

In the preexistent estate we lived and learned much, no doubt, 
and were therefore endowed with great intelligence, but it appears 
there was something lacking and that something was a mortal body. 
The body could be secured only by those who passed into the second 
estate, which is quite clearly described in general terms in the 
scriptures and revelations of God to men. In the Pearl of Great 
Price these significant words will be found: , (Book' of Abraham, Chap- 
ter 3, verses 24 to 26 inclusive.) 

And there stood one among them that was like unto God, and he said unto those 
who were with him: We will go down, for there is space there, and we will 
take of these materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell ; 

And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever 
the Lord their God shall command them; 

And they who keep their first estate shall be added upon ; and they who keep 
not their first estate shall not have glory in the same kingdom with these who keep 
their first estate ; and they who keep their second estate shall have glory added 
upon their heads for ever and ever. 

IN THE SECOND ESTATE A LIVING SOUL 

That man might properly be introduced into this second estate 
of his wonderful experience "God said, Let us make man in our 
image, after our likeness ; and' let them have dominion over the fish 
of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over 
al \, e ?? h ' and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the 
earth. (Genesis Chapter 1, Verse 26.) 

In the first estate man was a living spirit; in the second estate 
he became a living soul for there was added to his spirit a mortal 
body. By the combination of spirit and body, or in other words 
-spirit and element, man may attain to a fulness of joy The exact 
language of the revelation is found in the Doctrine and Covenants, 
Section 93, verses 33, 34 and 35, as follows : 

For man is spirit The elements are eternal, and spirit and element insenarablv 
connected, receive a fulness of joy; cicmcm, inseparaDly 

And when separated, man cannot receive a fulness of joy. 
The elements are the tabernacle of God ; yea man is tfip t,h Pr m,i „t rv, i 
temples; and whatsoever temple is defiled, <g t^t^^t^**™ 

It is evident that the second estate is a time for the testing of 
the souls of men wherein those who live righteous lives, obeying 
the commandments of God, will receive a fulness of joy that will 
come to them in the resurrection from the grave.

THOSE WHO KEPT NOT THEIR FIRST ESTATE 

"And they who keep not their first estate shall not have glory 
in the same kingdom with those who keep their first estate" or shall 
not have mortal bodies. 

There was, a large number of that class of spirits who followed 
Lucifer in the great war of rebellion in heaven described in the 
scriptures, Book of Revelation, Chapter 12, verses 7 to 9 inclusive : 

And there was war in heaven; Michael and his angels fought against the 
dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels, 

And prevailed not ; neither was their place found any more in heaven. 

And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the devil, and 
Satan, which deceiveth the whole world : he was cast out into the earth, and his 
angels were cast out with him. 

These wicked rebellious spirits were cast out of heaven into the 
earth and became the devil and his angels. Their punishment, we 
learn from the writings of Joseph Smith the Prophet, was that they 
were denied the privilege of having bodies, or in other words, they 
failed to keep their first estate and missed the great and important 
blessing of being added upon. Their punishment is great ; their dis- 
appointment must have been keen. 

MORTALITY A BLESSED PRIVILEGE 

In what I have already said we begin to see the purpose of life. 
Were it not for mortality on the earth in this second estate we would 
have continued in spirit form as we were in our first estate. But 
now, we are told in the Book of Genesis, that man is in the image of 
God, is made like him with this difference, that God is a glorified be- 
ing, a glorified man. I know there are some people in the world at 
large who might regard this statement as blasphemy, but it is the 
truth, nevertheless, and is published in the Pearl of Great Price, Book 
of Moses, Chapter 6, Verse 57 : 

Wherefore teach it unto your children, that all men, everywhere.^ must repent, 
or they can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God, for no unclean thing can dwell 
there, or dwell in his presence ; for, in the language of Adam, Man of Holiness 
is his name, and the name of his Only Begotten is the Son of Man, even Jesus 
Christ, a righteous Judge, who shall come in the meridian of time. 

By reason of these estates the human family is passing through, 
they may attain by righteousness, to exaltation and glory in the king- 
dom of God. 

THE IMPORTANCE OF MARRIAGE 

In connection with the experience gained upon the earth in mor- 
tality comes the glorious principle of marriage, which is of the ut- 
most importance to our present and future welfare. It is highly 
essential that every young man and every young woman in the 
Church should look carefully into this matter with a prayerful spirit 
before taking upon himself or upon herself the responsibility of mar- 
riage.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



TWO KINDS OF MARRIAGE 



There are two kinds of marriage, the civil marriage and the 
Temple marriage. Is the civil marriage a good marriage ? Yes, it is 
a good marriage, a legal marriage. It is good as far as it goes. It 
is a bond however that has no force or virtue after death. 

The Temple marriage is different. When a couple is united 
by the ordinance of God's house they are married for time and all 
eternity, and thus is perpetuated the great principle of fatherhood 
and motherhood, as already mentioned. Oh, how, very important is 
this matter ! Young men in Israel be careful, young women be care- 
ful. In seeking this blessing be sure to get the best there is. The best is 
what God offers, and not what is given by man. 

I testify to you, in all humility, that this is the Church of the 
Redeemer, and that Joseph Smith was his prophet; that Christ died 
for the sins of the world, that we might arise from this fallen condi- 
tion that we are in ; that we might be redeemed and brought back 
into the presence of God, in which event we will have solved the 
problem of life. 

God bless you, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER DON B. COLTON 

President of the Eastern States Mission 

While it is sometimes difficult, it is always an honor to rep- 
resent one of the great missions of the Church. I carry that 
feeling this morning in speaking in behalf of the Eastern States 
Mission. You know it is one of the most populous missions in 
the Church and we have all kinds and classes of people living 
within that great mission. We see the rich and the poor and all 
grades— I was going to say— of humanity. It is therefore an in- 
spiring thought that the Gospel of Jesus Christ does answer the 
problems of life for all classes of people. 

I have rejoiced in the words of this conference. I have re- 
joiced in the fine teachings and especially in the spirit of the con- 
ference, and feel as you I am sure feel that those who come with 
a spirit and desire to worship are greatly inspired and impressed 

Not long ago in one of the cities of the East a well informed 
and well educated man attended our services. At the close of the 
service he said : "You need not speak to me of your religion from 
the standpoint of the scriptures, I have been studying it long 
and I am sure it agrees with the teachings of the Savior as re- 
corded m the Bible. I believe in the principles of the Gospel as 
you teach them, but I want to know, and I am seeking to find a 
religion that will answer some of the practical problems of life 
1 want to know how we can meet this great inequality that exists 
in the economic world, where some are rich and some are poor 
Does the religion you teach answer that question?" 

I was glad to answer "yes." Though it may sound presump-

tuous, God has revealed in this day the answer to the problems 
of life that are so distressing in this world today. I have thought 
somewhat to gather accurate statistics, and have found it some- 
what difficult. But one government statistician wrote me a letter 
not long ago and said it was a safe estimate to say that a billion 
and a quarter dollars are spent in this country every year for 
tobacco, that that is the cost to the ultimate consumer. He said 
it was perhaps safe to say that an equal amount is spent for 
liquor. He would not venture an estimate on the cost of tea and 
coffee, but he did say to me that if all of the cost of the things 
that are forbidden in our Word of Wisdom could be accurately 
ascertained he was sure that it would exceed more than four bil- 
lion dollars a year. That is the amount estimated now by the 
government as necessary to place on the payrolls 3,500,000 men. 

If we could save to the people of the United States and to 
this Church the amount of money that is expended for the things 
that are forbidden by the word of God we would go a long way 
toward solving the question of unemployment. Moreover, we 
hear a good deal said of the "share the wealth" programs of the 
world. Do you know that that is basic in the financial policy of 
this Church? Our financial laws are made upon ability to pay, 
and if we honestly paid even our tithing we would have more 
than sufficient to take care of the wants of the people, and there 
would not be great inequality in the wealth of the world. God 
has revealed a just and workable plan that would distribute prop- 
erly, if the laws are lived, the wealth of the world. Indeed he has 
asked us to consecrate even the surplus of our property unto the 
work of the Lord. 

When I had explained these laws together with the law of 
Fast offerings, this man said: "Why don't you preach that to us? 
Human hearts are yearning today for a message that you say is 
inherent in vour Gospel." 

Then he said: "What of the crime, and the sin and misery 

in the world?" 

To that also we give an answer. It has been referred to here 
this morning. We believe that the basic unit of civilization is the 
home; that it should be commenced in the most sacred places in 
the world— homes of prayer, homes of love, homes of unity, 
homes that are united and cemented under the inspiration of the 
Spirit of the Lord, and the children coming into the world under 
influences of that kind have a much better opportunity and better 
start in life. 

Our parents teach their children to live honorable and up- 
right lives, for "We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevo- 
lent, virtuous and in doing good to all men. ... If there is anything 
virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after 
these things." 

In a home life of that kind children are started properly. 



70 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sometimes it is true they depart therefrom, but the law of aver- 
ages teaches us that children brought up under the influence of 
a Latter-day Saint home are much more apt to walk in the paths 
of righteousness throughout life than otherwise. And then as 
soon as they are old enough they attend our auxiliary organiza- 
tions, our Sunday Schools, Primaries, Seminaries, Religion Classes 
and Mutual Improvement Associations— all these are helps in 
government, to save the souls of the children of men, to bring 
them to a higher and deeper appreciation of the religion of our 
Master, Jesus Christ. Therein Ave have a solution and answer to 
the question, How shall we improve the morals and avoid the 
sins of the world? 

The answer is, by starting the home life properly, by jrivme 
attention to the ideals of the home, and living the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ, with all these other helps in government, to brino- us 
nearer to the ideals of a perfect life. & 

Again my friend said: "Why don't you teach us that?" 

t u S ? ld : I' 1 . wlsh 1 could ' 1 could P^ture to you the life of a 
Latter-day Saint. I could picture to you the life of a mother in 
this Church, and I could give to you the hopes and ideals and 
ambitions that are implanted in the hearts of the boys and girls 
of this Church by reason of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, by point- 
ing toward the great ideal of all-the life, and the light, and the 
way, even Jesus Christ." b 

. And last of all we teach them faith in a living God, faith in 
a just and merciful Father, that this life is but a preparation for 

o t& r s ' V 1 V* t0 i C r C ' and that under the inspiration 
of the Spirit of our Heavenly Father we shall go on to perfection. 

Blind unbelief is sure to err 
And scan his works in vain; 
God is his own interpreter, 
And he will make it plain. '

SECOND DAY 



AFTERNOON MEETING 

The fourth session of the Conference was held Saturday afternoon, 
April 6, at 2 o'clock. 

The Manti Choir furnished the music for this meeting. 

The hymn, "Zion Prospers, All is Well," was sung by the choir. 

Elder Joseph T. Finlinson, President of the Deseret Stake, ottered 

the invocation. . , 

"Let the Mountains Shout for Joy," an anthem, was sung by ttie 

choir. 

ELDER ALONZO A. HINCKLEY 

Of the Council of the Tzvelve Apostles 

This is an inspiring sight indeed. My soul has been stirred 
through the various sessions of this conference, it seems to me, to 
deeper depths than it has ever been sounded before. It has all been 
o-lorious. I plead now for the endowment of the Holy Ghost, to per- 
mit me to do and say that which would be proper and fitting upon 
this occasion. 

It has been my privilege, recently, to visit more than 1 have ever 
clone heretofore, the stakes of Zion. I have been deeply impressed 
in my visits with the people, and I have thought if I might have the 
liberty of the Spirit for a few moments this afternoon, that I may 
speak upon a very common theme, but pertaining to that which I 
think is perhaps one of the most potent powers in the world, that of 
the holy priesthood. 

THE ARMY OF THE LORD 

A few weeks back I was permitted to attend a stake conference. 
I was delighted with the numbers that came out to the various 
meetings on the Sabbath clay. But they held a priesthood meeting in 
that stake Monday evening. As I went back to attend that priest- 
hood meeting, and looked into the faces of 778 men, I was thrilled ; 
and as they stood and, under the direction of the capable leader, sang 
a hymn, it seemed to me that it virtually opened the gates of heaven 
that the Lord might pour out a blessing upon them. Seven hundred 
seventy-eight men, on a week-day evening, men who are busy mak- 
ing their honest living, but there assembled to better qualify them- 
selves to offer a consecrated service to the Lord ! I thought as I 
looked at them, this is a sort of a vision of the strength and power 
and virility of this Church ; one stake out of the hundred and eleven, 
and there assembled this fine group of men. 

I thought: What is the army of the Lord? I looked at a seg- 
ment of it. If 'I multiply it by one hundred and eleven I will get 
some glimpse of this mighty army— 90,000 men bearing the holy 
Melchizedek priesthood; 90,000 young men bearing the Aaromc 
priesthood. What a power! This is a Church of priesthood, 



72 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

and priesthood is a potent power, an ever-growing- ever-in- 
creasing- power,-not a wasting, not a wicked, not a destroying 
P ?r C ^ i a Sa T mg ' conserva tive, righteous power— yes, the power 
of God delegated to man, delegated to man in his weakness. Yes bu 
not in his wickedness. ' 

THE SOURCE OF THEIR STRENGTH 

These are men possessed of faith in God our Father and in Tesus 
Uinst, our Lord. These are men who put on the full armor of right- 
eousness and have forsaken Satan, the arch enemy of God and a 1 
hat he stands for. These are men who were cleansed by baptism 
by immersion, men who have received the Holy Ghost by ie C 
on of hands of those in authority; men unto whom the Lord has 

demS ion of Z^U^^ the salvation of men and the re- 
demption of the world; men who have taken upon themselves and 
adopted every principle and order and practice of righteousness and

ELDER ALONZO A. HINCKLEY

We know to whom to look, to him whom the Lord has appointed, 
and while he has given him two choice men to be his counselors, he 
says of the three, that they are appointed and ordained of God to 
stand in their position, and they are to be sustained by the faith 
and confidence and prayers of the Saints, and that these three consti- 
tute a quorum of presidency, and unto that presidency the Lord re- 
veals the oracles -of the Church for the whole church. 

EVERY MAN KNOWS HIS CALLING 

While the revelation is definite in outlining the responsibility, 
duty and authority of this presidency, the Lord, in his mercy, has 
made the duties and responsibilities and authority of every other 
man that holds the priesthood, just as clearly defined as for the presi- 
dency of the Church. Every man in this Church knows his calling, 
knows his place, knows his authority. There is no schism, no di- 
vision, no misunderstanding, because the Lord, after he has outlined 
all of their duties, sends them forth to labor with this admonition : 

Wherefore, now let every man learn his duty, and to act in the office in which 
he is appointed, in all diligence. 

So this hundred and eighty thousand can be added to and multi- 
plied, and with the Lord's way never develop any friction, any mis- 
understanding. The opportunities in this Church are boundless. 
This, to my mind, is the marvelous work and wonder that the Lord 
said should come forth, a provision whereby every man, true, honest; 
and of good report, may receive by divine interposition of hands the 
holy priesthood ; every boy over twelve years of age called to labor, 
given a ministry, given authority to speak and act in the name of the 
Lord. Nothing else like it anywhere in the world ! 

THE MAGNITUDE OF THIS WORK 

We are a people of priesthood in very deed. Some complain 
who are not of us, for we are a people that enjoy the same distinc- 
tion as the ancient Saints that Peter spoke of, only perhaps we enjoy 
it to a greater degree. He said of the people : 

But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar 
people that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of 
darkness into his marvelous light. 

No wonder that the Lord, when he had an organization and had 
followed it along, line upon line, revelation upon revelation, until 
Joseph the Prophet was authorized to lay the foundation of the 
Church — no wonder that he should say : 

Hearken, O ye people of my church, saith the voice of him who dwells on 
high, and whose eyes are upon all men ; yea, verily I say : Hearken ye people from 
afar ; and ye that are upon the islands of the sea, listen together. 

For verily the voice of the Lord is unto all men, and there is none to escape ; 



74 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



and there is no eye that shall not see, neither ear that shall not hear, neither heart 
that shall not be penetrated. . . . 

And the voice of warning shall be unto all people, by the mouths of my dis- 
ciples, whom I have chosen in these last days. 

And they shall go forth and none shall stay them, for I the Lord have com- 
manded them. 

Behold, this is mine authority, and the authority of my servants. 

ONLY ON PRINCIPLES OF RIGHTEOUSNESS 

No power can stop that. The way is perfect. The way of the 
Lord fails not. There are some imperfections, yes, in us, but the 
Lord has indicated that we should overcome our imperfections ; and 
it has been preached in this conference how we should overcome our 
imperfections, and that the Lord expects it of us. 

President Clawson said it is a long way to perfection, a long" 
struggle, but he said we must be on the way. We must be struggling 
to that end, laying off every weakness, developing every inherent 
power, being added upon by the Holy Ghost, making our lives such 
that we have a right to officiate in the name of the Lord. That is 
the secret of our power. We cannot function, we cannot move the 
powers of heaven, we cannot bring to pass much righteousness, or 
any righteousness, T may say, only on principles of genuine right- 
eousness that are in us, that we live, that we act, that we are what 
the Lord would have us to be. He has never lowered the standard. 
The standard that he gave through the Prophet Joseph Smith to the 
Prophet's father has never been varied or let down. The Lord said 
to him, when he made his inquiry in faith, believing: 

Therefore, O ye that embark in the service of God, see that ye serve him with 
all your heart, might, mind and* strength, that ye may stand blameless before God 
at the last day. 

Therefore, if ye have desires to serve God ye are called to the work ; 

For behold the field is white already to harvest; and lo, he that thrusteth 
in his sickle with his might, the same layeth up in store that he perisheth not, but 
bringeth salvation to his soul ; 

And faith, hope, charity and love, with an eye single to the glory of God, 
qualify him for the work. 

Remember, faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, brotherly kind- 
ness, godliness, charity, humility, diligence. 

What a preparation ! What an army we have ! What a light 
to the world, if Ave just followed and kept that high standard in our 
minds! There would be no boy that would drift. There would be no 
father nor mother but what would point their son toward the day 
when he should feel moving within him a spirit akin to the; spirit 
which moved in the Master when he was but twelve years of age. 

THE BOY OF TWELVE 

I have cherished the belief that it was not just a "happened so" 
that the Lord said that a clean, wholesome boy of twelve years of age 
should be permitted to receive the priesthood. I believe that it is 



ELDER ALONZO A. HINCKLEY 



75 



natural to him at that period of his life to feel that he would like to 
be up and about his Father's business. 

I think, bishops — and I speak with some degree of understand- 
ing-, because I have labored in such a council — I think, presidents 
of stakes, I think, fathers, and 'I think, mothers, there is no higher 
ideal that could be pointed to a son than : "Watch the day, make 
your preparation, be ready to speak, have a spirit like a Samuel, and 
when the Lord calls, say: 'Lord, speak; thy servant heareth.' " 

I know that the Lord wants us to have our boys, at twelve, in 
groups of twelve, presided over by sweet, clean, wholesome boys of 
their age. I know that he wants to have our boys, in groups of 
twenty-four, under presidencies of their own group, watching over 
the Church, to see that there is no iniquity, evil-speaking, or back- 
biting in the Church. 

THE LORD S WAY 

It seems so fitting to me to think that the Lord has made pro- 
vision that the young man eighteen and nineteen years of age shall 
sit at the feet of the bishop and be instructed, with him as president ; 
that he shall be taught, and that he shall go into the house of the 
Saints; that he shall preach, teach, exhort, and expound the script- 
ure ; that ninety-six men, older, maturer, receiving the holy Melchiz- 
edek priesthood, shall stand next to the presidency of the stake and 
be the standing ministry of the stake ; and the seventy, by their divine 
appointment, shall lift up their voices in every land and clime, call 
men unto repentance and teach them the Gospel, and induct them 
into the fold of Christ. So beautiful, so perfect, so complete, is the 
Lord's way! 

HE WHO KEEPS HIS ARMOR BRIGHT 

Would there be any soul that wouldn't be inspired to keep his 
armor bright and to be available, and to offer his first devotion unto 
God? Blessed is the man that finds himself in accord with this. 
Blessed is the man that takes upon him the whole armor of Christ. 
Blessed is the man who stands, as the Lord says he should, and 
sustains the presidency of this Church with his confidence, with his 
faith, with his prayers, with his works. Happy indeed is he who 
shall walk in the light, and his feet shall follow safe paths, and his 
children and his children's children after him shall rise up and call 
him blessed. 

AN AWFUL CONDITION 

But oh, for those who turn their back upon the Lord — I think 
I might be permitted to read a few words concerning them. To me 
these are doleful words : 

Cursed are all those that shall lift up the heel against mine anointed, saith 
the Lord, and cry they have sinned when they have not sinned before me, saith 
the Lord, but have done that which was meet in mine eyes, and which I com- 
manded them. 



76 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



But those who cry transgression do it because they are the servants of sin, and 
are the children of disobedience themselves. 

And those who swear falsely against my servants, that they might bring them 
into bondage and death — 

Wo unto them ; because they have offended my little ones they shall be severed 
from the ordinances of mine house. 

Their basket shall not be full, their houses and their barns shall perish, and 
they themselves shall 'be despised by those that flattered them. 

They shall not have right to the priesthood, nor their posterity after them, 
from generation to generation. 

What a condition! How do men ever reach that condition? 
The Lord says "Because they will not hear the voice of the Lord, nor 
^/ the servants of the Lord, nor hearken to the words of the apostles and 
prophets, but every man walketh in his own light, according to his 
own way." 

God help us to be free from such a fate as that, and lead us to 
stand valiantly for the truth forever, and reveal to us, through his 
Holy Spirit, through the unspeakable gift of the Holy Ghost, his 
mind and will. God help us to be so pure, so virtuous and true, that 
the doctrines of the priesthood shall distill upon our souls as the 
dews froim heaven, now, henceforth and forever, I pray for you, for 
me, and for our children and our children's children forever, in the 
name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 

First Counselor in the Presiding Bishopric 

Soon after I entered upon my ministry as one of the Presiding 
Bishopric, I was requested to tear down a monument erected by the first 
pioneers. It did not appear to many of us, at that time, that that work 
being destroyed was a monument. Many of you, no doubt, remember 
the rock wall that surrounded part of the block east of us. I played 
around it as a boy and grew up under its shadows ; but the full signifi- 
cance of it did not come to me until the task of tearing it down was 
assigned to me. 

As I witnessed the heavy sledge hammers break out the stones from 
the mortar, and saw the rock wall crumble, there came to me a picture 
of conditions that caused it to be erected. I saw groups of men unem- 
ployed other than the employment provided to keep them active and to 
help them feel they were doing their part to build a city. In this day 
we would call it work relief. I saw in my mind men gathering stones 
from the face of the earth, some burning rock for lime, others hauling 
sand, mixing mortar, and laying the rock and mortar into the wall. 

I pleaded with Bishop Nibley to let me move one of the buttresses, 
to stand it as a pillar for future generations to look upon. His answer 
was : "We have the temple wall, and I hope the time will never come 
when we tear that down. This wall has served its purpose." 

For the last two years it has been my duty to help pass upon the 
expenditure of government funds, and I could not help but think, while 



ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 



77 



Brother Smoot was talking, of some of the accomplishments — if they can 
be called accomplishments — of some of the sons of those sturdy pioneers, 
who have been employed on relief work. 

I have made a few notes from which I shall call attention to a few 
things which have happened during the last year. 

In the State of Utah 26,000 families have been on relief, numbering 
112,000 people, almost the population of Salt Lake City; 22 percent of 
the families of the State. They received $27 per family per month ap- 
proximately; $10,000,000 of government money during the last twelve 
months, and about $2,000,000 from the sales tax of the State of Utah. 

Idaho has 17,000 families on relief, numbering 62,000 individuals, 
14 per cent of her population, and they have received $24 per family per 
month, or nearly $2,000,000 for the third quarter. I haven't the record 
for the year. 

Arizona had 26,000 families on relief, numbering approximately 
103,000 individuals, 24 per cent of the population, and they have re- 
ceived $20 per month per family, nearly $8,000,000 a year. 

The State of Utah furnished 8 percent; the State of Idaho 1/10 of 
1 per cent; the State of Arizona 13.7 per cent. 

The counties in the State of Utah, 7 percent; the' counties of Idaho 
7Yl percent, and the counties of Arizona nothing. 

Besides this we have had surplus commodities which were dis- 
tributed, beef /pork, butter, lard, rice, beans, cereals, cotton in all forms, 
ready for clothing, for ticking ; and mattresses have been made and dis- 
tributed to the poor. 

One hundred twenty-six thousand of our cattle in the State of Utah 
have been slaughtered, and approximately 35,000 of them were destroyed 
as being unfit for food. The balance were canned and distributed for food 
as fresh meat. 

A week ago I asked one of the engineers inspecting the work we 
have been doing on this work relief what the actual value of the work 
accomplished was. I suggested it would possibly reach about 40 percent. 
His answer was : "I think 25 percent, and certainly not more than 30 
percent, is a fair actual value." 

Then I looked back upon that wall which years ago I helped tear 
down. That wall, when built, had in it the souls of men who were liv- 
ing, not for today but tomorrow, and for generations yet to come. And 
when I have seen, during the past year, requests come in for two thou- 
sand, three thousand, four thousand dollars to pay men to go out on the 
ditch banks and clean weeds that our pride should naturally suggest we 
do without being employed to do it ; and requests for funds to pay men 
to tear down trees that our fathers had planted and nourished, I have 
wondered sometimes if there are not some among us who have for- 
gotten the spirit of our fathers, for I find few places where trees have, 
as yet, replaced those that have been torn down. 

When I think of these things, I recall the statement made in the 
Book of Mormon, recorded in Ether, 9th chapter, 26th verse : 

And the people had spread again over all the face of the land, and there began 
again to be an exceeding great wickedness upon the face of the land. . . .

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



And there came prophets in the land again, crying repentance unto them — that 
they must prepare the way of the Lord, or there should come a curse upon the face 
of the land ; yea, even there should be a great famine, in which they should be 
destroyed if they did not repent. 

But the people believed not the words of the prophets, but they cast them 
out; . . . 

Now, when the people saw that they must perish, they began to repent of their 
iniquities, and cry unto the Lord. 

And it came to pass that when they had humbled themselves sufficiently before 
the Lord he did send rain upon the face of the earth ; and the people began to 
revive again, and there began to be fruit in the north countries, and in all the 
countries round about. And the Lord did show forth his power unto them in 
preserving them from famine. 

As I stand here and look through the windows of this building-, I 
see a monument. We know it as the seagull monument. Oh, how many 
times have I heard my father tell that story. I would like to repeat it, 
but time will not permit. He was a part of it as a boy in his tenth year, 
and I have never known him to speak of it without wiping the tears 
from his eyes as he mentioned that great miracle which prepared the way 
for increased faith and renewed determination. 

When I think of the troubles, the hardships, the trials endured by 
those who made it possible for us to live in this land, I wonder if we, 
their children and grandchildren, are growing up to believe, as they be- 
lieved, that God will hear and answer prayers ; that he will grant unto 
us every choice blessing ; that to receive these blessings it is absolutely 
necessary that we live close to him and are obedient to his command- 
ments, for his blessings will not come to those who turn from him and 
make light of his work. 

Encouragement comes to me in the fact that I can visit with you, 
my brethren, who have learned that the factor of safety in this Church 
is activity in the Church. The man upon whom the priesthood has been 
conferred who fails to magnify his priesthood is in danger of losing it 
and its blessings. He has not learned to know, or forgets, the spirit 
that comes with active work under the influence of the Spirit of God and 
he drifts under evil influences ; and because we permit him to drift, and 
to fall away, and make light of the power which has been promised to 
him, and which perhaps he has exercised, we must pay also for neglect- 
ing our responsibility. 

• 1 }\ m u j f Seems at times that we are deprived of blessings which 
rightfully belong to us, because we have failed in our duty to keep con- 
stantly in touch with those of our brethren upon whom the priesthood 
has been conferred, and who, because of evil influences, are being drawn 
away. b 

During this depression we made a survey and found that those who 
Have been tithepayers were not suffering as those who were not tithe- 

P u yerS " 1 ion SUtVey ° f three stakes ' with a total of twenty-one wards, 
showed 332 men over the age of 65— and the average age was 75 plus. 
But we found of that number only 26 were dependent. The balance 
were independent ; as compared with the insurance table, from which we 
learn that of 100 men who start life at the age of 25, 1 is very wealthy, 



ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 



79 



4 are independent, 3 are spending all they have, 36 have died, 54 are 
dependent at the age of 65. 

I believe, my brethren and sisters, that the greatest insurance that 
can come to man or woman in this earth is that assurance which God 
gives, the promise that to those who are faithful and keep his com- 
mandments shall come eternal life and happiness. 

God help us to understand his purposes. May we look back upon 
the work of our ancestors and remember that the actuating influence was 
faith. May we recall the blessings that came to them, and which have 
been passed on to us. Let us develop in our own soul a spirit of pride, 
that it may not be said of us that we must turn to charity, forgetting 
God and his promises. May we keep the commandments of God and 
magnify his work and humble ourselves before the Lord. I pray, my 
brethren and sisters, that he will look upon us in mercy, help us to un- 
derstand his purposes fully and to labor in faith and diligence to accom- 
plish them, that we may enjoy the blessings he has promised, I ask it in 
the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

"O Divine Redeemer," was sung by the Manti Choir, Clara Johnson, 
soloist. 

ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 

Of the Council of the Tzuelve Apostles 

My brethren and sisters, I pray that the influence which has made this 
conference beautifully spiritual may guide me while I stand before you. I 
always feel that it is a great privilege to bear testimony to the truth of 
the Gospel, and I feel so today, although I confess that to stand before 
this great audience is to be, filled with human fear. 

THE THINGS THAT PERTAIN TO GOD 

I testify to you, my brethren and sisters, that I know that God 
lives, that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, our Redeemer, and that the 
Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ has been restored in these days, for our 
good and salvation, through the instrumentality of the Prophet Joseph 
Smith. I rejoice in this knowledge and in this testimony. Into this 
knowledge I can tie all the. affairs of my life. It gives life and joy to all 
the things that pertain to my life. 

I know that it is good to deal with the things of God. In this per- 
plexing and perplexed world, in this world of depression of which we 
have heard much during this conference, there is no place in which we 
can find such comfort and peace, joy and forgetfulness, as in the things 
that pertain to God and his dealings with his children. To read the 
scriptures when one is depressed, to attend meetings, to go to the temple, 
is to bring peace and comfort into one's heart. I believe, my brethren and 
sisters, that when we so do, we are able to see more clearly the solutions of 
the affairs of life, and understand better how to meet the issues of this 
or any other day that may come into our lives.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



I know that God is guiding this Church. His will is overshadowing 
his Church. There is no chance in the progress of this great institution. 
As this Church goes about doing its duty, no mistakes are made that do 
not vanish in the great forward movement occasioned by the Spirit of 
God. 

NOTABLE EVENTS IN CHURCH HISTORY 

I have been thinking a great deal lately about the notable events that 
occurred one hundred years ago. I have had occasion to read the splendid 
issue of the Improvement Era dedicated to the memory of the organization 
of the first Council of the Twelve and the first Council of the Seventy 
in this dispensation. I trust that every Latter-day Saint home will se- 
cure a copy of this very notable publication of the Church, and secure 
them before the edition is exhausted. The Deseret News, likewise, has 
featured these events for the last several weeks. I have enjoyed reflecting 
upon the matters that these publications have set forth before us. 

May I say, in passing, that I hope all Latter-day Saints have' access 
to our own great newspaper, the Deseret News. I read it daily, and I am 
very glad — and it is indeed the truth as I understand it, — to say to you that 
no finer newspaper reaches my table, nor do I find a finer one as I travel 
about throughout the world. If we want our papers and magazines to 
be worthy of this great Church, we must sustain them loyally, not only 
with our good will but with our purses as well. 

A MOST REMARKABLE REVELATION 

One hundred years ago this spring great things happened in this 
Church; the greatest as an evidence of God's guiding hand over his 
Church, occurred on March 28th, 1835, just a few days more than one 
hundred years ago. On that day the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints received a revelation which is one of the most remarkable 
documents in the possession of man. It stands absolutely unique ; there 
is none like it. There is no time here to discuss the details of this revela- 
tion ; but it sets forth, in plainness and simplicity, the organization of the 
quorums of the priesthood; the mutual relations of the quorums to 
one another; the judicial system of the Church is foreshadowed and out- 
lined ; and there is a wonderful picture of the early history of the priest- 
hood. I doubt whether any other such document, of the same small 
extent, the same few number of words, lies at the foundation of any other 
great human institution. 

This revelation, now known as Section 107, together with two or 
three other revelations, forms, as it were, the constitution of the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, upon which we are building today, 
and upon which we will build until the Lord comes. It is so comprehen- 
sive in its brevity, so magnificent in its simplicity, that we have found no 
occasion, up to the present, to wish that it might have been more com- 
plete. 



ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE

BUILDING THE CHURCH OF CHRIST 

The thing that impresses me about this revelation is the manner of its 
coming. When the Prophet Joseph Smith was but a lad, he had the great 
privilege of seeing and conversing with the Father and the Son. Later, 
Moroni came to visit him. This visit was followed by a number of revela- 
tions; the plates were obtained; the Book of Mormon was translated. 
Then, suddenly as it seems to us, reading the history of the Church, on 
April 6th, 1830, all that which the Prophet had obtained was assembled, 
organized, crystallized in the revelation known as Section twenty in the 
book of Doctrine and Covenants ; and the Church of Jesus Christ was or- 
ganized and reestablished upon the earth. 

After the organization of the Church a series of great revelations 
came to the Prophet, until the great day of which I am speaking, March 
28th, 1835. As I read human history I know of no other period of five 
years,save the years of the Savior's ministry, that is so rich in the pre- 
sentation of new, eternal truth, as these first five years in the history of 
the restored Church of Christ. Elders were provided for in 1830. 
High priests were ordained in 1831. A year or two later the first presi- 
dency was organized. In the spring of 1835 apostles and seventies were 
called. Then all at once, as it were, God summed up all that he had 
given the Prophet and the people, and gave a simple revelation, Section 
107 in the book of Doctrine and Covenants, to serve as another founda- 
tion stone for the building of the Church of Christ. 

That is God's way ; that is the natural way. We men and women, 
when we build nations often attempt to write their constitutions in full at 
the beginning. The natural way is God's way, to receive here a little 
and^ there a little, until the time of ripening comes and completion is 
attained. 

BUILDING FOR ETERNAL LIFE 

I wonder, my brethren and sisters, if we do not need that lesson 
today. W e worry a great deal about the days that come and go, about the 
depression, (and we have need to worry about it) and about many other 
things that give us concern. Yet I feel, frequently, that if we would go 
about doing our duties properly and fully, that somehow out of the small 
as _ well as the great experiences of our lives would crystallize the great 
thing for us, the thing that we most need. I cannot understand eternal life 
any other way. I do my duty, little by little, day by day, year by year, and 
then the Lord takes the deeds of my life, and as we use bridks in the 
building of a house, he builds for me eternal life. We may have forgotten 
that, at times, in our eagerness to accomplish. 

THE MANNER OF ITS COMING 

. While I was thinking about this revelation, I became, interested in 
the manner of its coming. I find in the History of the Church, that the 
first Twelve who had been selected in February scarcely knew what to 
do. It was a new calling to them. Finally they assembled and decided 



82 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



that they would leave their homes and set about to preach the Gospel, in 
accordance with instructions given through the Prophet Joseph Smith. 
On March 28th, 1835, as they were about to leave on their missions, they 
sent to the Prophet Joseph Smith a letter, the major part of which reads 
as follows ( It is signed by the Council of the Twelve, by, their clerks 
Orson Hyde and William E. M'Lellin) : 

We feel to ask of him whom we have acknowledged to be our Prophet and Seer 
that he inquire of God for us, and obtain a revelation, (if consistent) that we may 
look upon it when we are separated, that our hearts may be comforted. Our worth- 
iness has not inspired us to make this request, but our unworthiness. We have 
unitedly asked God our Heavenly Father to grant unto us, through his Seer, 
a revelation of his mind and will concerning our duty the coming season, even a 
great revelation, that will enlarge our hearts, comfort us in adversity, and brighten 
our hopes amidst the powers of darkness. 

TWO IMPORTANT LESSONS 

I read in this request two great lessons : First, if we want something 
for this Church and Kingdom, or if we want something for our individual 
lives, we must have a great, earnest, overpowering desire for that thing. 
We must reach out for it, with full faith in our Heavenly Father 'that the 
gift may be given us. Then it would seem as if the Lord himself cannot 
resist our petition. If our desire is strong enough, if our whole will is 
tempered and attuned to that which we desire, if our lives make us worthy 
of the desired gift, the Lord, by his own words, is bound to give us that 
which we desire, in his own time and in his own manner. These twelve 
men, chosen witnesses of the Lord Jesus Christ, prayed upon their knees 
that a revelation might be given to comfort them. They put themselves 
into this desire with all their strength and they obtained answer in this 
great revelation, on the very same day, from the mouth of tbe Prophet 
Joseph Smith. 

There is yet another lesson, which I think we need. In their request 
the brethren of the first Council of the Twelve said, "We feel to ask of 
him whom we have acknowledged to be our Prophet and Seer :" I wonder 
also if all of us do acknowledge our Prophet and Seer as these men ac- 
know edged him. They declared for the generations to come that he 
was their prophet and seer, that he had the power to guide them and the 
Uiurch. 1 hey placed themselves, as it were, at his disposal, because of the 
inspiration that was his as the President of the Church. Perhaps we fail 
to receive some revelations in our day which are waiting for us because 
we do not recognize our prophet and seer with the same deep faith with 
which these first apostles approached the prophet of their day as they 
pleaded with him and with the Lord for a great revelation to guide and 
comfort them. b 

MISSIONARY WORK ESTABLISHED 

,1 7? ^T^i th ° Ught Hngers in m y mind - It was in this notable 
evelation that the missionary work of the Church was formally brgan- 

W hv,wA rSt w 6 111 ? is dis P ensa *ion. Missionary work had been 
done b) tins Church from the very beginning of its existence ; and perhaps 



ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 



83 



even before the Church was organized. But, when Section 107 was 
given, missionary work was formally established ; the appointment and 
definition of the twelve apostles were clearly made ; the labors and func- 
tions of the Seventies were equally clearly set out ; and missionary work 
went forward, from that time on, as never before. 

VALUE OF MISSIONARY WORK 

The demand that the Church organize for missionary work involves 
the indispensable principle of sacrifice, which already has been touched 
upon here in this conference. There is no progress, no attainment worth 
while, no effort acceptable to our Heavenly Father, except upon the 
principle of the giving of one's self, in cooperation with the Lord, for the- 
great earth purposes of the Almighty. What great results have come out 
of missionary work ! There is probably not a person in a thousand in this 
great audience who cannot trace his pedigree in the Church back to the 
conversion of some ancestor, or of himself, by a missionary in the field. 
We are all products of our missionary work. 

The value of missionary work is not alone in the spread of the knowl- 
edge of the Gospel, and in the converts made. The effects upon those 
engaged in it are equally striking. The Council of the Twelve, during the 
last twelve months, have been engaged in a survey of the present condition 
of all living, returned missionaries in the Church. You stake presidents 
and bishops will remember the blanks sent out to you. This work is not 
quite complete yet. When finished it will undoubtedly be published for 
your information. I have selected from the record some few figures 
that seem eloquent of what missionary work does for the individual. 

THE EFFECT UPON THE MISSIONARY 

We have now in the office the records of 15,742' returned living mis- 
sionaries, men and women. Of these, the stake presidents and bishops 
certify that 96 per cent exert a good influence among their fellows : 84 
per cent are tithe-payers ; 86 per cent keep the Word of Wisdom : 73 per 
cent — and remember that many of these returned missionaries are elderly 
people, unable to hold office — are holding office in the Church today. What 
is almost the most remarkable, in this day of depression, 92 per cent of all 
the living returned missionaries, are employed. The 8 per cent who are 
not employed, include the housewives and the older people who are unable 
to work. My estimate is that not more than 4 per cent of our returned 
missionaries are unemployed. 

I think these figures speak for themselves as to the good effects 
of missionary labor upon the missionary himself. True, the missionaries 
are a selected group. They are chosen because they are worthy ; but even 
so, these figures are really eloquent in showing that missionary sacrifice 
and service strengthen the man and fit him better for work with the 
Church and for work among his fellow men. Indeed, would a man be 
successful in life, he would find missionary service of great help to him. 

I am grateful to the Lord for the great revelation of March 28th, ' 
1835. May we all learn to know it, learn to understand it, live in accord-

ance with it, and in all things be worthy of the great things that the Lord 
has given us, I pray, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER JOHN H. TAYLOR 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

_ I humbly pray, my brethren and sisters, that the Lord will direct 
me in the things that I have to say to you this afternoon. 

I am very fortunate in having the association and the friendship of 
the young men and women of the Church who have accepted a call to 
go out and preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ. I say I am fortunate, 
because they represent a very splendid type of young people. They 
have good health. They are well educated for their age. They have 
good morals. They have an honest desire in their hearts to go out and 
preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ in plainness and simplicity, and give 
of their time and their service in the interest of this great work. 

It is true that there are some exceptions, and those exceptions ought 
- to be as few as possible, because of the missionary himself, because of 
the Church, because of investigators and those who are friendly toward 
us. 

The missionary needs good health, because this type of life is a 
strenuous life, and those who are engaged in it ought to go out in as 
good physical condition as it is possible. They owe it to their mis- 
sion, they owe it to their companion, they owe it to those who are fur- 
nishing the means, to be so equipped physically that they will be able to 
do the work assigned to them. 

As I say, the work is strenuous, and the mission field is not a place 
for invalids or those who have chronic ailments. There is a place for 
such people at home, where they may serve with greater satisfaction to 
themselves and more helpfulness to the Church, It is also our duty to 
keep our missionaries in good health when they are in the mission field, 
and to return them home, as far as it is possible, in good health and 
strength. 

It is true that our Heavenly Father blesses us and guides us and 
protects us, but it always seems to me that our Heavenly Father can be 
relied upon to protect and help us more if we do our part in protecting 
ourselves. When missionaries are careless and do not give proper care 
to their bodies, I am sure that they cannot be protected in the same way 
or to the degree that missionaries can who are careful and live accord- 
ing to the commandments of the Lord. 

Their education, I say, is good. It is on the average. They are 
young people, and as far as their youth will permit they have gone 
through the schools. We sometimes find criticism about our young 
peop e and the education that they have, but as long as we send young 
people of eighteen, nineteen or twenty years of age we cannot expect 
them to go out with college degrees. If we want the other type— and I 
think we do— we will have to send missionaries who are older to add to 
the splendid type of young people whom we now have. 

fhey have good morals, an essential thing in preaching the Gospel 



ELDER JOHN H. TAYLOR 



85 



of Jesus Christ. Men and women cannot go out unless they have ob- 
served the standards of the Lord, and have kept themselves in a con- 
dition that the Lord can let his Holy Spirit dwell with them. Occa- 
sionally we do have men coming into our Missionary Home who are 
using tobacco and liquor, and if we know that they are using it when 
they come into the Missionary Home I am sure that the bishop or the 
parents or the president of the stake cannot use the excuse that they did 
not know that the young man was not keeping the Word of Wisdom. 

It seems to me that after one hundred years as a Church we ought 
to be able to maintain that standard with our people who preach the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ. Those who are willing to try and make amends, 
if it is necessary, and show forth a desire to live right, have a greater 
chance of making good and having God's blessing and protection than 
those who will not try to observe the usual standards that we have in 
the Church. 

Of course, it is essential that our missionaries shall be clean. No 
man and no woman will ever receive a testimony, or will ever succeed, 
who cannot observe the law of cleanliness in their lives. If there should 
be some who have unfortunately broken this commandment they must 
truly repent. God cannot bless them if they show no signs of repentance, 
nor a desire to do the things he wants them to do. 

We desire them to equip themselves spiritually, because without the 
Spirit of the Lord and a knowledge of the Gospel they hamper them- 
selves and they hamper the work. The reason that missionaries receive 
a testimony so rapidly in the missionary field is because they devote their 
time, their energy, their thoughts and their prayers to finding out about 
God and his work, and doing the things that God wants them to do. And 
when they do that they receive, almost instantly, a testimony of the di- 
vinity of this great work. 

This is a time when it takes considerable sacrifice on the part of 
parents and of the missionaries to go out and preach, but they are mak- 
ing good at it, and they have faith in God, the Eternal Father. A young 
man in the ITome just a short time ago said to me: "Brother Taylor, I 
would like to say to you in all sincerity that I am grateful to my Heav- 
enly Father, and I ain grateful to my parents, for the opportunity I 
have had of preaching the Gospel ;" and you could see that he sincerely 
meant it, that he had made good, and was glad for his missionary ex- 
perience. 

I said to him : "Your father and mother were just here. They will 
soon be back again." 

He replied : "Then I think I will go downstairs and wait for them. 
I haven't seen them for two years." 

He went clown to his room, and it wasn't long before the father and 
mother came and went down to their boy, and they were united again. 
I was glad I wasn't there. I am sure it was too sacred a thing for any 
one else to be present except the boy and the father and mother. 

A father said to me : "I am bringing my daughter to the Home. I 
have $125.00, maybe $150.00. I hope that will keep her until fall. That 
is all I have. Maybe by then I will be able to earn some more. I have 



86 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

faith in God." And then he said this thing: "I would like to send my 
sister's son on a mission. He lost his mother when he was a child. He 
is a good boy and is twenty years of age. I hope that in just a little 
while I will not only have enough money to keep my girl, but I will have 
enough money to send my sister's boy out into the missionary field, be- 
cause I want him to have the things that his mother would have given 
to him had she been alive." 

A boy, on the day that he was to leave for the train, kept coming to 
the desk and asking, "Have you had any word here for me?" 

I said: "No, we haven't had any word." 

He said: "I am expecting my father. I haven't seen him for a 
long while. I have been working here in the city, and he lives a long- 
distance from here. When I wrote and told him that I was going on a 
mission he said he would come to see me, and he hasn't come." It got 
later and later in the day, so he said : "I think I will go clown and get 
my valises and go to the train. It is time to leave." 

When he was downstairs, over the telephone came a long-distance 
call. I called him, and the father spoke to him about his mission. When 
he hung up the phone he repeated his father's words to me : "I am sorry 
that I cannot come. I haven't the money. I need it for you. Goodbye, 
boy, God bless you." 

He went downstairs, got his grips and went to the station. When 
he left he said : "My ! It was good to hear the voice of my father." 

Such are the men and women, such are the boys and girls that are 
going out to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ. May the Lord bless 
them and keep them, bring them back safely to us, and bless us men and 
women at home, that we will do our part and fulfil our calling. May 
God be pleased with us because of our love for him, I humbly pray, in 
the name of Jesus Christ, our Redeemer. Amen. 



ELDER JOSEPH QUINNEY, JR. 

President of the Northwestern States Mission 

I am grateful beyond my power to say for the privilege that I have 
m lifting my voice in the defense of truth in the Northwestern States 
Mission. 

We have sixty-one missionaries in our mission. They desire that 
I express to their parents and those who are supporting them, their grati- 
tude for the sacrifices that are being made to keep them in the ministry 
of the Lord, this in order that they can represent the Church to the best of 
their abi hty, and unfold the Gospel of Jesus Christ to the people 
who are living in that land. 

They are doing well. They are responding most nobly to the re- 
sponsibilities that are resting upon them. They are growing in the work, 
ihey are growing m testimony and in a knowledge of the Gospel as it; 
has been restored through the instrumentality of the Prophet Joseph 
bmith. Ihey are well, happy, and strong. It is a joy and satisfaction 
to labor with them, to feel of their spirit and attitude toward this great 
and noble work. 



ELDER JOSEPH QUINNEY, JR. 87 

Those who have preceded me in presiding over the Northwestern 
States Mission have done outstanding work. I refer particularly to 
the work that has heen done by Apostle Melvin J. Ballard. The people 
of that land refer to him in terms of affection; as also to those who 
succeeded him in the presidency, Bishop Iverson, President B. S. Young 
and my immediate predecessor, William R. Sloan. These men are be- 
loved by the people of that country and they have done a noble and 
outstanding service for the Church. 

I am happy to say that the people of the Northwest, as a rule, are 
generous in their feelings, and respond to the Gospel message when it 
is presented to them. As a result, many are coming into the Church. 
The newspapers also are generous. They solicit news items from day 
to day and give space in their papers that does credit to our Church. I 
am grateful to report these items for I feel that God's work is increas- 
ing and growing stronger and stronger ; also that the testimony of these 
young men and women is being felt and understood by many people who 
are receptive to the truth. 

One of the happiest and most important things of life is to tell and 
live the truth. Never have I appreciated so much the significance of 
this thought as I do at the present time. I believe that one of the finest 
things that you and I can have is a testimony concerning the divinity 
of this work, and living the truth brings into life this testimony. I do 
not mean a testimony that comes to one upon the impulse of the mo- 
ment, but I mean a living and vital testimony that gives us a feeling and 
the assurance that God lives and that he answers prayers. I also think 
that the greatest thought that one can have is a thought of God. It de- 
velops within us a spiritual power that brings us in close touch with the 
/Unseen. It provides creative character which, of course, comes from 
the deep fountains of spiritual life, and we find our deepest service 
in ministering to the spiritual sources of life. 

To me one of the finest heritages that has come to us is that qual- 
ity of faith and testimony exercised by our pioneer fathers and mothers. 
I firmly believe had it not been for this abiding testimony, they never 
would have reached their destination, built their homes and established 
this western civilization. Many of them, as we know, were driven out 
into the cold, bleak wintry storms and 'vast wilderness with a hope and 
a belief and a testimony that God would protect and lead them on. They 
read the right, thought the right, and lived the right. They knew and 
felt this great work. They consciously and unconsciously reflected the 
very highest in spiritual life, and knew the power in the statement, "By 
their fruits ye shall know them." 

I wonder sometimes if we are maintaining the reputation that these 
pioneers established. I remember going into the great Bank of Montreal 
in the city of Montreal, Canada, with a check to be cashed. The 
usher of the bank, seeing me in the lobby, came to me. I handed him 
the check with the request that it be cashed. He looked at it and 
saw the name, "Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints," printed 
upon the face of that check. He motioned to the paying teller of the 
bank to come into the lobby and said to him, "Give Mr. Quinney the 



88 



GENERAL CONEERENCE 



amount of money that this check calls for because it is all right." It 
carried the name of the Church and the reputation of the Church was 
known and felt by this gentleman. There was no question in the mind 
of this man as to the validity of the reputation of the Church or con- 
cerning my representation of the Church in that country. As a conse- 
quence of this fact, I was given the money I needed. 

"By their fruits ye shall know them" and the fruits of this great 
Church are known everywhere and are becoming better known. Pre- 
judices of the people are lifting. We are able to approach many in this 
day that I am sure a few years ago we would have been unable to inter- 
est in our work. So I really feel that it is an honor to be called into the 
ministry and unfold to the best of my ability the saving graces of this 
Church. 

Our pioneers built well. There is no question in my mind as to 
whom they worshiped. I feel that their conception of God was definite 
and fixed in their souls. It is said "that poets worship beauty, scientists 
worship truth, every man of honor worships right. That is, the good, 
true, and beautiful stand above us calling out our adoration, and all the 
best in us springs from our worshipful response to their appeal. But 
the impulse to adore is never fulfilled until we gather up all life into 
spiritual unity and bow down in awe and joy before God. That is adora- 
tion glorified, worship crowned and consummated. And the only God 
man can adore with awe and joy is personal. No impersonal thing is 
worshipful, however great a thing may be it still lies beneath our soul. 
No abstract idea is worshipful, we are still greater than any idea that 
we can hold. Only God, thought of in personal terms but known to be 
greater than any terms which human life can use, is adorable. Men 
have believed in him because worship is man's holiest impulse." So 
the impulse to worship the true and the living God permitted these 
worthy pioneers to come into this land where they could give vent to 
their feelings and glorify God. As a result, and as above stated, they 
have left for us, it seems to me, our finest heritage, that of a testimony 
of the divinity and truth of this work. 

I want to leave with you my humble testimony, that I, too, know 
that God lives, that he answers prayers, that he used Joseph Smith as 
an instrumentality through which to restore the saving graces of his 
Gospel. I pray God to bless us with an increased and abiding testimony, 
with a full appreciation that we are engaged in his work, that it is fine, 
that it is good, that it is satisfying, and that it is true, and may we be 
thankful that we are privileged to bear this message of testimony from 
time to time to the convincing of many souls to a knowledge of God and 
his truth, is my humble prayer, and I ask it in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

The Manti Choir sang the anthem, "Inflammatus," solo by Mildred 
Jensen. 

Elder Thomas W. Richards, President of the Malad Stake, offered 
the closing prayer. 

Conference adjourned until 9:30 Sunday morning, April 7. 



THIRD DAY 



MORNING MEETING 
Sunday morning, April 7. 

The public were invited to witness the nation-wide broadcast of 
the Tabernacle Choir and Organ, which preceded the fifth session of the 
General Conference, beginning at 9:30 and continuing until 10:15. The 
doors of the Tabernacle were closed at 9:20 and remained closed until 
the completion of this 45 minute broadcast. 

When the time arrived for commencing this program the Taber- 
nacle auditorium and galleries were crowded, every available space being 
occupied. Amplifying equipment having been installed on the Taber- 
nacle grounds and in the large Assembly Hall on the Temple Block, 
thousands of people assembled on the grounds and in the Assembly Hall, 
where they listened to the musical program and the proceedings of the 
Conference as they were broadcast from the Tabernacle. 

The following program of choral and organ music was broadcast by 
radio throughout the United States and Canada, over the Columbia 
Broadcasting System, originating over Station KSL : 

"The Heavens Resound" (Beethoven) — Choir. 

"The Lost Chord" (Sullivan) — Organ. 

"For the Strength of the Hills" (Stephens)— Choir. 

"Toccata in F" (Widor) — Organ. 

"Easter Music" (Stephens) — Choir and Mrs. Edith G. Young. 

"Unfold Ye Portals" (Gounod)— Choir. 

"Swing Low, Sweet Chariot" — Organ. 

"The Morning Breaks" (Careless) — Choir. 

"Meditation" (Grieg) — Organ. 

"Rise Up, Arise" (Mendelssohn) — Choir. 

The Tabernacle Choir was conducted by Professor Anthony C. 
Lund. Organ accompaniments and organ solo presentations were played 
by Frank Asper. 

Following this broadcast, Elder Wilford W. Warnick, President of 
the Timpanogos Stake, offered the opening prayer. 

PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 

First Counselor in the First Presidency 

My brethren and sisters, in common with you I have enjoyed the 
quiet, the peace, and the hope of this conference. It is my earnest prayer 
— which I hope shall be fortified by yours — that I may say nothing today 
which will mar that spirit, but on the contrary will help to build it up. 

TRIBUTE AND COUNSEL TO CHOIR 

I should like again to pay tribute to the beautiful music which we 
have had during this conference — the Singing Mothers, the Manti Choir, 



90 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



the Hawaiian Chorus, and now this morning our wonderful Tabernacle 
Choir. I can assure you that perhaps nothing we have ever done in the 
Church has been more effective in bringing before the people of the 
world a message of peace, of good will, of faith, and of hope, than the 
work of this choir. They, combined with the organ, speak with a spirit- 
ual authority which is felt by all of those who listen; and I am sure 
you pray with me that their work may be continued, that their ardor may 
be increased, but above and beyond all that individually and collectively 
their spirituality shall be built up. Because I wish to tell them — and to 
tell you — that their message will travel to the ends of the earth, as the 
Lord designs it, only if they shall live in accordance with the laws and 
the principles of the Gospel. It need not be thought by any of them that 
he is but one of a number, and therefore his life does not count ; they 
live under as strict a law as the old laws of Moses, where the ills of one 
were visited upon the whole body. 

So, to each and every one of them I lend not only encouragement, 
but I give to them a word of advice and caution : They must live in 
accordance with the principles of the Gospel if they are to perform the 
mission to which they are called. 

SUSTAINING GOVERNMENTS AND LAWS A FUNDAMENTAL PRECEPT 

I desire, my brethren and sisters, to speak upon a matter than which 
nothing is. nearer to my heart in this world. I want to speak of it in 
soberness, in sincerity, and with all the earnestness I can command. The 
matter about which I wish to speak is the Constitution of the United 
States, and the Government provided for and set up under it. 

The Twelfth Article of Faith reads : 

We believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers, and magistrates, in 
obeying, bonoring, and sustaining the law. 

That is one of the fundamental precepts of our faith. 

GOVERNMENTS INSTITUTED OF GOD 

At a general assembly held in Kirtland on August 17, 1835, the 
Saints adopted a series of statements regarding human government. 
They are wise and as far-reaching as the Articles of Faith themselves, 
and I wish to read some of the paragraphs therefrom. They were given 
after the mobbings, the plunderings, the assassinations of and part of 
our experiences in Missouri. They were uttered by a people, who, 
judged by human standards, had every reason to feel that their govern- 
ment had failed, and that they might not hopefully and successfully look 
thereto for their protection. The first paragraph of that Declaration 
(Section 134) reads as follows: 

We believe,, bat governments were instituted of God for the benefit of man. . . . 

ACCOUNTABLE TO THE LORD 

Thus is'cleclared in this first clause the origin of human government. 
The paragraph continues : 



PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 91 



and that he holds men accountable for their acts in relation to them. . . . 

Therefore, every man who takes on a responsibility by virtue of 
assuming office in worldly government, is responsible to the Lord" him- 
self for the way in which he carries it out. I am sure there is here some- 
thing to give pause to every Latter-day Saint who seeks the franchise of 
his fellow citizens in order that he may rule over them. This paragraph 
continues : 

both in making laws and administering them, for the good and safety of 
society. 

So that, whether a man takes office* in the legislature, or in the 
executive branch of government, or in the judicial branch, he becomes, 
by virtue of that assumption of office, responsible to the Lord himself 
under the decrees of this Church. 

Paragraph No. 2. reads: 

We believe that no government can exist in peace, except such laws are framed 
and held inviolate as will secure to each individual. ... 

And I ask you to note the declaration which now follows these 
words, a declaration, I repeat, made after the mobbings and plunderings 
of Missouri, when apparently government had failed. A declaration 
made after the people had tried the United Order and had not been able 
to live up to it, made after they had been rocked and torn by' hardships 
and persecutions, against which they should have been protected. The 
] laragraph continues : 

will secure to each individual, the free exercise of conscience, the right and 
control of property, and the protection of life. 

These are the great basic elements of free, ordered society and gov- 
ernment. 

TWO DECLARATIONS OF EQUAL WISDOM 

May I place here alongside this Declaration of our own people, that 
well-known and inspired utterance of those who framed the Declaration 
of Independence: 

We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal, that they 
are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights ; that among these arc 
life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights governments 
are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the 
governed. 

These two great declarations, the one of the Church and the other 
of the fathers of our country, stand side by side, equal in their wisdom 
and in their present timeliness. Each was born of oppression and per- 
secution. 

FREEDOM OF WORSHIP 

The 4th paragraph of that Declaration adopted at Kirtland reads 
as follows : 

We believe that religion is instituted of God; and that men .re amenable to 
him, and to him only, for the exercise of it, unless their religious opinions prompt 
them to infringe upon the rights and liberties of others. 



92 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



That, my brethren and sisters, is fundamental with us. We arc 
universal in our tolerance and in our respect for the opinions of others. 
We feel we may rightfully ask for the same consideration for ourselves. 
This also was announced in our Articles of Faith, the eleventh article 
reading : 

We claim the privilege of. worshiping Almighty God according to the dictates 
of our own conscience and allow all men the same privilege, let them worship how, 
where, or what they may. 

The final clauses of the fourth paragraph of the Declaration read: 

But we do not believe that human law has the right to interfere in prescribing 
rules of worship to bind the consciences of men, nor dictate forms for public or 
private devotion : that the civil magistrates should restrain crime but never control 
conscience; should punish guilt, but never suppress the freedom of the soul. 

I will ask you to carry those last clauses in your mind until I reach 
a later portion of what I hope to say. 

WORLD-WIDE CHURCH 

The 5th paragraph of this great Declaration reads as follows : 
We believe that all men are bound to sustain and uphold the respective govern- 
ments in which they reside, while protected in their inherent and inalienable rights 
by the laws of such governments. . . . 

In that Declaration the Church visualized not alone an existence 
here in the United States of America, but it visualized an existence in 
all parts of the world, as the Church has grown to be and to exist, and 
it laid down the rule of conduct by which all Latter-day Saints should 
be guided, no matter where they live or to what flag they owe allegiance. 
Thus the Church visualized its great destiny— a world-wide Church 
among all nations. 

PERSONAL AND PROPERTY RIGHTS PROTECTED 

This paragraph continues: 

And that all governments have a right to enact such laws as in their own 
judgments are best calculated to secure the public interest; at the same time, 
however, holding sacred the freedom of conscience. 

I ask you to hold in mind that sentiment and that principle also. 
I shall read only one more of the twelve paragraphs of the Declara- 
tion; I now read the 11th paragraph: 

We believe that men should appeal to the civil law for redress of all wrongs 
and grievances, where personal abuse is> inflicted or the right of property or char- 
acter infringed, where such laws exist as will protect the same ; but we believe 
(hat all men are justified in defending themselves, their friends, and property, 
and the government, from the unlawful assaults and encroachments of all persons 
in times of exigency, where immediate appeal cannot be made to the laws, and relief 
n frorded. 

The foregoing were the declarations of this people on the principles 
underlying human government ; this people still adheres to these prin- 
ciples. 



PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR.

LOYALTY TO RULE OF LAW 

I pass now to the divine word regarding our own government. 

While the Saints were still undergoing suffering in Missouri, and 
after they had suffered much from the mobs who were driving them 
from their homes, and mis-treating and mal-treating them, the Lord gave 
a revelation to the Church, in the course of which he said (I am reading 
from Section 101 of the Doctrine and Covenants) : 

And again I say unto you, those who have been scattered by their enemies 
it is my will that they should continue to importune for redress, and redemption' 
by the hands of those who are placed as rulers and are in authority over you— 

Notwithstanding all their sufferings, the Lord directs that they shall 
still have a loyalty to the rule of law. The revelation continues : 

According to the laws and constitution of the people, which I have suffered 
to be established, and should be maintained for the rights and protection of all 
ilesh, according to just and holy principles; 

That every man may act in doctrine and principle pertaining to futurity, accord- 
ing to the moral agency which I have given unto him . . . 

DIVINE WORD REGARDING HUMAN GOVERNMENT 

The Lord is here declaring the scope and fundamental principle of 
the Constitution of the United States : 

That every man may be accountable for his own sins in the day of judgment. 
Therefore it is not right that any man should be in bondage one to another. 
And for this purpose have I established the Constitution of this land by the 
hands of wise men whom I raised up unto this very purpose. 

To me, my brethren and sisters, that statement of the Lord, "I have 
established the Constitution of this land," puts the Constitution of the 
United States in the position in which it would be if it were written in 
this book of Doctrine and Covenants itself. This makes the Constitu- 
tion the word of the Lord to us. That it was given, not by oral utter- 
ance, but by the operation of his mind and spirit upon the minds of men, 
inspiring them to the working out of this great document of human gov- 
ernment, does not alter its authority. 

RELIGION AND THE CONSTITUTION 

The first Congress of the United States, when it began to consider 
the operations of the government under the Constitution, became im- 
pressed that there was not in that document, as originally drawn, any 
so-called Bill of Rights ; there were in the document no provisions which 
should keep the people free, which should protect them in their daily 
lives, nor guarantee to them the great liberties which the Declaration of 
Independence declared were the heritage of men. Accordingly this Con- 
gress proposed to the original states the first ten amendments to the 
Constitution, and it is significant, I am sure, of the influence which the 
Lord was at that time bringing to bear upon the minds of men, that the 
very first clause of the very first amendment declared : 

.. . Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or pro- 
hibiting the free exercise thereof. 



94 



GENERAL CONEERENCE 



Thus the very first thing which our fathers sought to secure for 
themselves and for their posterity was freedom to worship as they 
wished. I do not need to call to your minds the trials and persecution 
which this people have suffered in the past, in order to bring home to 
you the conviction that nothing else in the great document, the Consti- 
tution, is so important to this people as is this guarantee of religious 
freedom, because underneath and behind all that lies in our lives, all 
that we do in our lives, is our religion, our worship, our belief and faith 
in God. We need the Constitution and its guarantees of liberty and 
freedom more than any other people in the world, for, few and weak 
as we are, we stand naked and helpless except when clothed with its 
benign provisions. 

ENDEAVORING TO ESTABLISH MODERN PAGANISM 

So well known is this, so thoroughly is it understood that the dic- 
tators of the world are now seeking to take hold of the religion of the 
people over whom they rule. They are doing away, or trying to, with 
the churches of Christianity. They are trying to establish, even in great 
and progressive nations, a modern paganism. That can never be done 
under the Constitution of the United States, and that is why its pro- 
tection and preservation come to us as one of the most vital duties we 
can have in life. 

FUNDAMENTALS OF CONSTITUTION GOD-GIVEN 

One of the most important things that we can do for the Church is 
to stand behind the Constitution of the United States. That does not 
mean, and no reasoning person would suppose that it meant, that that 
Constitution may not from time to time be changed as the needs of the 
people would seem to require. But it does mean that that Constitution 
should be changed only under the urge of great necessity, and then only 
in accordance with its great underlying concepts. It does mean that 
the great fundamental elements of the Constitution are God-given, for 
he said so. It does mean to me as an individual that the Constitution of 
the United States and my adherence to it and support of it is a part of 
my religion. 

I have about the Constitution that same sort of conviction that I 
have about the other doctrines that we are taught, for I believe its pre- 
cepts are among the doctrines of the Church, and I believe that the Lord 
will change and modify from time to time those details of its provisions 
which are ancilliary to its great principles ; he will cause us — those who 
live under it — to modify it in accordance with our needs; but the funda- 
mental principles of it we may not sacrifice. 

ELEMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF CONSTITUTION 

We may not abrogate the great principles that the majority must 
rule ; that we shall live under a written Constitution ; that we shall be 
governed by people chosen by the free, untrammeled, and uncompelled 
will of the people; that there shall be an absolute guarantee of our per- 



PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 



95 



sonal liberties, as also of our rights to property, and to the protection 
therefor; that there shall continue freedom of speech, freedom of the 
press, and freedom of religion ; that the punishment of common crime 
and misdemeanors shall remain the function of state, county and muni- 
cipal government ; that there shall be three great and wholly independent 
branches of government— the executive, the legislative, and the judicial; 
that the determination of the constitutionality of legislative acts shall 
continue in the judiciary; that no power shall exist in one branch of 
government to delegate its power and authority to another; that the 
rights and power of the executive branch of the government shall con- 
tinue to be merely that of executing the law ; that the federal govern- 
ment shall continue to guarantee to every state a republican form of 
government. If time permitted I could mention other principles of like 
importance to these. 

NO DICTATORSHIP IN AMERICA 

A proper understanding of the Constitution of the United States 
makes clear that, under it, there is no room in America for a dictator- 
ship. There are those in subordinate positions in government, there are 
those among us, citizens of this country, who are looking forward to 
some sort of overturning which would make opportunity for the estab- 
lishment of some other sort of government than that provided by our 
Constitution. It is my faith and belief that these overtures, these revo- 
lutionists, are but few, but they are attacking the citadel of our liberties, 
they are attacking the guarantee of the freedom of our worship, and 
the Latter-day Saints can not be numbered among them. 

IN NEED OF CONVICTIONS 

Convictions are the great need of the people of the world today. 
Men need to be convinced of something. They need religious convic- 
tions, and it is not, in the first instance so important what those con- 
victions may be, looking to the peace and ordered condition of the world. 
1 he people of the world need convictions regarding righteousness in civic 
and political life ; they need convictions on the eternal verities of right 
and wrong. Great masses of people everywhere in the world are wan- 
dering aimlessly in their religious, in their intellectual, in their social, 
and in their civic lives, without any guiding principles ; "every wind of 
doctrine" strains the moorings that have held them for generations. 

This must be changed. 

OUR OPPORTUNITY AND MISSION 

This great audience is a demonstration that among the Latter-day 
Saints there still remain convictions in all of the fields of human en- 
deavor and activity which I have named. It is our opportunity to make 
of these convictions our glory. It is our opportunity and our duty to 
make of these the leaven that "leaveneth the whole lump." In so far as 
we fail to do this, we shall fail in the mission which the Lord gave to us, 
and shall not reach the destiny which he has set for us. 

My brethren and sisters, this nation of ours has a record of achieve- 



96 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ment behind it that we may not lightly cast aside, for it is builded upon 
the experiences of men during the ages that are past. Consider our 
growth and our development, consider what we are, consider how we 
have come to be what we are, contemplate this government of ours, this 
heritage which our fathers bought with their lives and bequeathed to 
us, and then do not lightly thrust aside the great fundamentals of our 
national life for something yet untried. 

May the Lord be with us at all times, under all circumstances ; may 
he bring into our lives a burning desire to uphold the Constitution, a 
living faith in its inspired origin, that we may always be found among 
those who shall support it to the last breath. May God give us this I ask 
in the name of Jesus. Amen. 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

We know that there is a God in heaven, who is infinite and eternal, from 
everlasting to everlasting the same unchangeable God, the framer of heaven and 
earth, and all things which are in them; 

And that he created man, male and female, after his own image and in his own 
likeness, created he them ; 

And gave unto them commandments that they should love and serve him the 
only living and true God, and that he should be the only being whom they should 
worship. 

But by the transgression of these holy laws man became sensual and devilish 
and became fallen man— (Doc. and Cov. 20:17-20.) 

MEANING OF CIVILIZATION 

A few weeks past a distinguished author and lecturer spoke in this 
city, before a certain group, on the question whether or not our civilization 
is to endure. This is a question today troubling 'the wise men in the 
nations. Perhaps I do not know just what this term means. I know 
what the dictionary says ; that civilization is a state of social and religious 
culture characterized by relative progress in the arts, science and state- 
craft, and also in spiritual advancement. 

There can be no true, perfect civilization where there is not faithful 
obedience to the commandments of God. When the dictionary says that 
civilization is relative progress, it may mean— I do not know— that there 
has been a gradual progression in matters of civilization from the begin- 
ning of time until now. If that is the meaning, then I cannot accept it 
as an historical truth. 

I sincerely believe, and for that reason I have read these words from 
the revelation given at the organization of the Church, that in the begin- 
ning God established a perfect civilization, for he gave to man his laws 
and called upon him to obey his commandments. But as we know and 
as the Lord declares in what I have read, man transgressed these divine 
laws, refused to hearken unto these commandments, departed from the 
ways of the Lord, and became sensual, devilish and fallen man. That is 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 



97 



the condition in which this world finds itself today, and the condition in 
which it has found itself since the fall of man. 

Civilizations, so-called, have risen and have fallen again, and strange 
to say, without exception it has been at the time of their greatest culture, 
their greatest progress in arts, in science and statecraft, when the crumb- 
ling began. We have before us the history of Egypt, of Assyria, Babylon, 
Greece, Rome, and other nations of the past, the glory of which has 
departed, each in turn. We cannot say that their civilization was not 
great, as civilization is usually measured by fallen man, for these nations 
have left their stamp upon the modern world, and especially so> is this 
true of the great nation of Greece, when it comes to the arts and some 
of the sciences, and yet the glory and the grandeur of that nation, like 
others, through the transgression of 'divine laws, have passed away. 

FUNDAMENTAL THINGS ENDURING 

Now, I would not for a moment have it understood that anything 
that I have in mind to say will be in conflict with anything that we have 
heard at this conference. I have no such intention, no such thought, nor 
do I believe that to be the case, for I believe that the fundamental things 
in our government, in the Constitution of the United States, are here to 
endure. Moreover, I believe that it is the business and responsibility of 
Latter-day Saints to uphold and sustain these sacred principles which 
bear the stamp of approval of God himself, and we should be loyal unto 
them. I am, however, going to say this, boldly— The present world 
civilization shall not endure, for God has said it: It is bound to pass away. 
May I also say I care not how soon that comes. 

THE DECREE OF THE LORD CONCERNING THE WICKED 

When I say this, do not misunderstand me. I do not say nor believe 
that things which are good will pass away, but because man has become 
sensual, devilish and fallen man, and because he will not hearken to the 
voice of inspiration and revelation from God, and walk in righteousness, 
keeping his commandments, the decree has gone forth that all man-made 
covenants, obligations and governments shall be changed and come to an 
end. Of course, I can only treat this theme briefly, but I desire to read 
to you a few of the words the Lord has given for our guidance in the 
dispensation in which we live. Let me read, beginning in the revelation 
where Elder Wilford W. Richards left off yesterday : 

And the voice of warning shall be unto all people, by the mouths of my dis- 
ciples, whom I have chosen in these last days. 

And they" shall go forth and none shall stay them, for I, the Lord, have com- 
manded them. . . . 

Wherefore, fear and tremble O ye people, for what I the Lord have decreed in 
them shall be fulfilled. 

And verily I say unto you, that they who go forth, bearing these tidings 
unto the inhabitants of the earth, to them is power given to seal both on earth and 
in heaven, the unbelieving and rebellious ; 

Yea,, verily, to seal them up unto the day when the wrath of God shall be 
poured out upon the wicked without measure — 



98 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Unto the day when the Lord shall come to recompense unto every man accord- 
ing to his work, and measure to every man according to the measure which he has 
measured to his fellow man. 

Wherefore the voice of the Lord is unto the ends of the earth, that all that 
will hear may hear : 

Prepare ye, prepare ye for that which is to come, for the Lord is nigh ; 

And the anger of the Lord is kindled, and his sword is bathed in heaven, and 
it shall fall upon the inhabitants of the earth. 

And the arm of the Lord shall be revealed; and the day cometh that they who 
will not hear the voice of the Lord, neither the voice of his servants, neither give 
heed to the words of the prophets and apostles, shall be cut off from among the 
people. 

I was asked, not long ago, if I could tell when the Lord would come. 
I answered "Yes," and I answer "Yes" now. I know when he will come. 
He will come tomorrow. We have his word for it. Let me read it : 

Behold, now it is called today until the coming of the Son of Man, and verily 
it is a day of sacrifice, and a day for the tithing of my people; for he that is tithed 
shall not be burned at his coming. 

Now, there is a discourse sufficient on tithing. 

For after today cometh the burning— this is speaking after the manner of the 
Lord— for verily 1 say, tomorrow all the proud and they that do wickedly shall 
be as stubble ; and I will burn them up, for I am the Lord of Hosts ; and I will not 
spare any that remain in Babylon. 

THE GREAT DAY OF THE LORD NIGH 

So the Lord is coming, I say, tomorrow. Then let us be prepared. 
Elder Orson F. Whitney used to write about the "Saturday Evening of 
Time." We are living in the "Saturday Evening of Time." This is the 
sixth day now drawing to its close. When the Lord says it is today until 
his coming, that, I think, is what he has in mind, for he shall come in the 
morning of the Sabbath, or seventh day of the earth's temporal existence, 
to inaugurate the millennial reign and to take his rightful place as King 
of kings and Lord of lords, to rule and reign upon the earth, as it is his 
right. 

Satan has usurped power and authority from the beginning, and men 
have followed him, as the Lord declares in that which I have read to you ; 
ibut his day is drawing to its close, and the day, as we frequently sing, 
is dawning for Israel, for Zion, for the universal establishment of truth! 
when the earth shall be cleansed of all impurity, all wickedness, for when 
Christ comes that which is wicked cannot remain. 

Again I read : 

Hearken ye, for, behold, the great day of the Lord is nigh at hand. 

For the day cometh that the Lord shall utter his voice out of heaven- the 
heavens shall shake and the earth shall tremble, and the trump of God shall sound 
both long and loud, and shall say to the sleeping nations : Ye saints arise and live ■ 
ye sinners stay and sleep until I shall call again. 

Wherefore gird up your loins lest ye be found among the wicked. 

Lift up your voices and spare not. Call upon the nations to*repent, both old 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 



99 



and young, both bond and free, saying : Prepare yourselves for the great day of the 
Lord ; 

For if I, who am a man, do lift up my voice and call upon you to repent, 
and ye hate me, what will ye say when the day cometh when the thunders shall 
utter their voices from the ends of the earth, speaking to the ears of all that live, 
saying — Repent and prepare for the great day of the Lord? 

Yea, and again, when the lightnings shall streak forth from the east unto the 
west, and shall utter forth their voices unto all that live, and make the ears of all 
tingle that hear, saying these words— Repent ye, for the great day of the Lord is 
come? 

And again, the Lord shall utter his voice out of heaven, saying : Hearken, O 
ye nations of the earth, and hear the words of that God who made you. 

ye nations of the earth, how often would I have gathered you together 
as a hen gather eth her chickens under her wings, but ye would not ! 

How oft have I called upon you by the mouth of my servants, and by the 
ministering of angels, and by mine own voice, and by the voice of thunderings, 
and by the voice of lightnings, and by the voice of tempests, and by the voice of 
earthquakes, and great hailstorms, and by the voice of famines and pestilences of 
every kind, and by the great sound of a trump, and by the voice of judgment, and 
by the voice of mercy all the day long, and by the voice of glory and honor and 
the riches of eternal life, and would have saved you with an everlasting salvation, 
but ye would not ! 

Behold, the day has come, when the cup of the wrath of mine indignation is 

full. 

Behold, verily I say unto you, that these are the words of the Lord your God. 

In that great revelation on war, (section 87) the Lord has told us 
that beginning with the rebellion of South Carolina great destructions 
would come, and they would continue to be poured out upon the earth 
until the time should come when the decrees of God would be fully 
consummated, finished, and he would make an end of all nations. I look 
for that to be fulfilled and Christ will come to reign ; his kingdom will be 
established on earth as in heaven, as he has taught us to pray: "Our 
Father who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name: Thy kingdom come. 
Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven." I pray for that time to 
come. 

1 plead with the Latter-day Saints to stand firm and faithful in the 
discharge of every duty, keeping the commandments of the Lord, honor- 
ing the priesthood, that we may stand when the Lord comes, — whether 
we be living or dead, it matters not, — to be partakers of this glory. 
Remember, when this time comes this earth is to be cleansed of its un- 
righteousness, and the wicked shall be as stubble and shall pass away. 

. TRUE CIVILIZATION 

Just one more thought : Do you think that if we were truly civilized, 
which means to be governed and guided as the Lord would have us 
guided, by his commandments, and as he has called upon us to conduct 
ourselves, do you think it would be possible or necessary for the legisla- 
ture of this State to meet for sixty days and more, wrangling and con- 
tending over methods how and by whom liquor should be dispensed within 
the State ? I want to tell you there would be no need for such legislation, 



100 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



no need for such laws, for every man would love to obey the law of God ; 
would keep his commandments, and we would not need to place upon 
the statutes measures of this kind endeavoring to control and direct us 
because we haven't sense enough to act wisely and justly through our 
agency in and of ourselves. 

May the Lord bless and guide us in truth, I pray, in the name of 
Jesus Christ, Amen. 

The Tabernacle Choir and the congregation sang the hymn "Praise 
to the Man Who Communed With Jehovah." 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

To look at this vast congregation, and realize the purpose of heart 
that has brought them together from various parts of the Church and 
of the world, is an inspiration that fills my soul. It is one of the thrills 
of this great conference. To sit here and listen to the beautiful musical 
program that has been rendered, broadcast to the world by this great 
Tabernacle Choir, and to consider how that man, through the blessing of 
God, has been able to devise the means to make this possible, is another 
great thrill, and leads me in my feelings to exclaim, with the poet : 

For all thy mercies, O my God, 

My rising soul surveys ; 
Transported with the muse I'm lost 

In wonderment, love and praise. 

REJOICES IN BLESSINGS OF THE CONFERENCE 

In the things which I have heard, and felt, with you, inspired of the 
Lord through his Holy Spirit, in the various sessions of this conference, I 
have had a great thrill. To listen to the beautiful music — for that which 
we have had during this conference has been exceptionally good and 
inspiring— and to hear the fervent prayers that have been offered, the 
sincere testimonies that have been borne, and the excellent advice and 
counsel that have been given — all has a tendency to make my soul rejoice. 

Not the least of the thrills that have come to me is the fact that 
our faithful Hawaiian brethren and sisters, ten in number, have come all 
the way from Hawaii to join with us in worshiping the Lord. in this 
conference, and to hear them sing in their native tongue and to feel the 
spirit of it. God bless these people, that their stay with us may be 
pleasant and that they may have a safe return home. They are of Israel. 

UNDER THE CURSE 

I have thought how that the results of the curse, through the fall of 
our first parents, rest upon mankind. These, our brethren and sisters 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 



101 



from Hawaii, and the people whom they represent, are under the same 
curse. My heart goes out in love to that people. Their blood is as red and 
pure as ours. Their hearts are tender. They are an affectionate people. 
They are a music-loving people. They have hearts prepared to receive the 
truth of the everlasting Gospel. We do not have all of the best of every- 
thing. They are deserving of all that the Lord has given them. 

I love that people. I believe that all that is needed is for me to become 
better acquainted with them, to labor with them, in order to love them as 
they were loved by President George Q. Cannon and by President Joseph 
F. Smith. We all know how they loved the Hawaiian people. They 
served them faithfully, in the early life of this Church, as missionaries 
of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and their names will 
never be forgotten by that people. 

HAS LOVE FOR THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS 

I love the Latter-day Saints. Is that going too far? Am I sure of 
what I say when I say I love them. I love them because they love what 
I love. I heard that quoted by Sister Kate C. Jensen this morning. It is 
beautiful. It expresses my thought. I love the Latter-day Saints because 
they subscribe to the same principles that I have subscribed to and are 
trying to live up to those principles. We have the evidence of it in your 
attendance here today, in the various sessions of this conference. We have 
the evidence of it in the statistics which were read to us in the opening 
session by President David O. McKay, showing the accomplishments of 
this work, of the Lord's people. That means you, brethren and sisters 
of the Church — evidences of your faithfulness, your love of the truth, and 
your integrity to the faith. 

HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN GOD 

The tithes and offerings, as I remember, more than $3,000,000.00 in 
one year, and that in times of great financial depression, — contributed by 
a people who are not rich, who are not wealthy! God has chosen the 
weak things and the poor of the earth, and has prepared their hearts to 
receive the Gospel, and of such are the Latter-day Saints ; Hut with their 
mite and meager earnings they have not forgotten their God. They have 
remembered him with their tithes and with their offerings, and those tithes 
and offerings have been wisely, judiciously and righteously expended, for 
the advancement of the Lord's work here upon the earth. 

EXPRESSES LOVE FOR MANKIND 

I love mankind. Oh, I wish I could fulfil the law in that respect. I 
love them because of what they have done for you and for me, for us, 
all those who have gone before. I love my parents. They gave me life. 
I appreciate my existence. I love my grandparents, for they gave my 
parents life and existence, and made it possible for me to live and enjoy 



102 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

the blessings I enjoy today. And just as well I love all my forebears ; no 
matter how far back they may be traced they belong to me and I to them. 
I love them. As I become more acquainted with them, by genealogical 
research and by doing for them the necessary work for their salvation, 
in the temple of the Lord, I love them more. 

I love mankind because they have given to me all the comforts that 
I have in my home, the modern means of transportation which I enjoy, 
in common with the people of this world, on the water, on the land, in the 
air; the modern means of heating and of lighting which we have in our' 
homes, even the water system, the knowledge to be able to take from 
these great natural streams of water, rivers, and make them to serve our 
purpose in power— yes, all the conveniences that we have. 

Who gave us these things but our forebears, and not those alone 
but those who are living contemporary with us ; many of them are among 
the great inventors of these things that afford us such comfort in life. Are 
we indebted to them ? I think we are. Then should we not love them? 
Should we not have a desire to do something for them in return, and if 
so, what can we do? 



MUST HEAR THE GOSPEL 

For the most part, men and women of this world are in abject pover- 
ty pertaining to a knowledge of the things of the kingdom of God. They 
know not God, the Eternal Father, as we know him to be, an immortal, 
glorified and exalted Being, of all power and love to perfection ; and his 
Son Jesus Christ. They are in the dark pertaining to these things, and 
they must be brought to the light in order that God's purposes may be 
fulfilled in their salvation, for men and women must hear the Gospel 
and receive it and live by it, if they will be exalted in the kingdom of God. 

It is to be taught to those who have gone beyond. It is their 
right. Justice demands and the scriptures teach that men cannot be 
judged by a law that has not been given to them. What can we do for 
those of the .world who are in need but to give unto them that which we 
have in such great abundance, that in the giving of it we do not impoverish 
ourselves but rather enrich our own souls, and it makes, too, for our 
own salvation. 

That is what the preaching of this Gospel in the nations of the world 
means to every nation, kindred, tongue and people. They are in need of 
it all this wide world. We have the truths of the everlasting Gospel. 
It is our responsibility to bring it to the attention of mankind in the most 
kind, impressive and forceful way that we may be able to do, under the 
impress of the Spirit of the Lord, which it will be our right and privilege 
to have and enjoy when engaged in this sacred ministry. 

IN BEHALF OF THE DEAD 

Now those who have gone beyond, is, there anything that we can do 
to pay the debt of gratitude we owe to them? Just as- we do for our 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 



103 



kindred dead, learn of them by genealogical research, build our temples, 
go into the temples and there receive for them, vicariously, the saving 
ordinances of the Gospel. Will it reach all those to whom we are in- 
debted?! Yes, if all of us look well to our kindred dead. It is a great 
responsibility. It is a commandment. The Lord told his servant Abra- 
ham that this world was created that we, his children, might come upon it, 
that we might be proven to see whether we will do all things whatsoever 
the Lord our God hath commanded us. That means, of course, whether 
we will keep all of the commandments of the Lord, not a few. 

LOVE OF GOD AND FELLOW MEN 

You know what the Ten Commandments are, that, the Lord wrote 
with his finger upon tables of stone, handed down to us. They are 
recorded in the twentieth chapter of Exodus of the Bible. They are 
binding upon us, as they were upon the children of Israel ; and other laws 
such as the law of the tithes. 

But to one who asked of the Savior, "Which is the greater law?" 
his answer was : "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, 
with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first great command- 
ment. And the second is like unto it ; Thou shalt love thy neighbor as 
thyself." 

It doesn't seem to me that it ought to be necessary, brethren and 
sisters, for us who are so well taught in the Gospel to receive a command- 
ment of this kind. Our knowledge of our indebtedness to God ought to 
lead us to serve him and keep all his commandments, though we had 
not been commanded. And our indebtedness to our fellow men, and the 
knowledge that they are our brothers, sons and daughters of God as we 
are, born of him in the spirit, in whom we should have common interest — 
this knowledge ought to lead us to do all that lies in our power, manifest- 
ing love of God and love of our fellow men. 

I want to say here that every man and woman that is engaged in the 
ministry of the Lord in this Church, at home or abroad, and faithfully 
engaged, is manifesting his or her love for him, his or her love for 
fellow men, and is helping to bring about the salvation of souls, which 
means the glory of our Father in heaven, and it will make for the 
individual's salvation, if only we can continue thus faithfully to the end. 
God grant that we may, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

As is usually the case at our General Conferences we shall not 
have time to hear from all who we would like to have address us. We 
desire to hear five or six minute speeches from some of our mission 
presidents who have not spoken in a General Conference since they 
returned from their missions. 



104 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ELDER JOHN V. BLUTH 

President of the Canadian Mission - 

I wish, my brethren and sisters, that I could express in words 
the joy and happiness I have had in this conference, in listening to 
the inspirational addresses that have, been given, and the wonderful 
melody, music and song, that have been rendered'. I rejoice that we 
have means by which these things can be transmitted to such dis- 
tances, that not only the thousands that are gathered in this build- 
ing, but^ hundreds of thousands in this nation are able to hear these 
proceedings. 

I visualized a scene this very morning, while the program was 
going on. Four hundred miles north of Portland, Maine, in the 
depths of the Maine woods, on the headwaters of the "Rhine" of 
America, the majestic St. Johns River, and near the southern bound- 
ary of Quebec, at a lone Forest Ranger Station, a forest ranger was 
listening to this particular musical program. If that broadcast car- 
ries also the services of this conference, he is "listening in" to the 
instructions that are given here. He contacted our Elders same two 
years ago, but because of the distance and the shortage of mission- 
aries, we have not been able to make contact again. He believes the 
Gospel but has not accepted it ; he rejoices in the beauties of that 
which he gets from these broadcasts. 

I am grateful for the privilege of laboring in the Canadian Mis- 
sion during the years that we have been there, for the knowledge and 
understanding that have come to us, for the testimony that God has 
given us, the testimony that has been strengthened while we have 
been there. Sister Bluth and I have been nearer unto the Lord than 
at any other period in our lives. We have taken joy in our labors, 
loved by the people there ; and we love them, because we see alike in the 
things that pertain to eternal life. 

We have been advised that about June of this year we will be re- 
leased from our missionary labors. We thank the brethren and 
praise God our Heavenly Father for the opportunity given us, for 
the joy that is m our hearts, for the little heaven that we have enjoyed 
while we have been away, for the knowledge and understanding that 
nave come to us. s 

I desire to bear my testimony to you that I know that God 
lives; I know that this is his work; that he is at the helm; that we 
need fear nothing, under those conditions, except our own failure 
to live up to what we have received. The keynote of this conference 

W 5 ? 6 G .f Pe1 ' a ? d ES an undercurrent of all our preach- 

ing in the four years that we have been there, there has been the same 
theme. 

Brethren and sisters, if you wish to realize all the joy and power 
of the Gospel of salvation m your lives, live all of its teachings or 
it will be worthless unto you. 



ELDER JOHN V. BLUTH 



105 



May God bless us and help us to serve him, to be true unto the 
covenants we have made with him, to live the principles of the Gos- 
pel, and realize in our lives the glories and the beauties that are fore- 
told in the scriptures. May we have faith, understanding and joy 
while we live here, and everlasting joy in the life to come, I humbly 
pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER MILES L. JONES 

Eo nn er President of the East Central States Mission 

This is rather unexpected to me, to be called upon to speak to 
you this morning. However, I rejoice in an opportunity to raise my 
voice in defense of this great latter-day work. For 1 a little over five 
and a half years I had the pleasure and the honor of laboring in 
the East Central States Mission, and I rejoiced in the wonderful 
growth of the work in that part of the Lord's vineyard and in the 
change of sentiment, through the press and through coming in con- 
tact with those with whom we had the opportunity of conversing- or 
corresponding. It gave me a great deal of pleasure to see the change 
in attitude toward our people. 

When I returned from attending conference last April there was 
a letter awaiting me, extending an invitation to attend a convention 
of the Associated Council of Churches of America, at Louisville. 
The letter was signed by the president of the association, and also 
by the president of the Ministerial Association of the City of Louis- 
ville, both joining in a large convention of ministers from all parts 
of the United States and Canada. 

I took the opportunity of attending that convention and min- 
gling with those good men, ministers who had gathered from all 
parts of the land, and I want to say that they treated me with the 
utmost courtesy. In our private conversations, whenever they 
learned that I was a Latter-day Saint and from Utah, they had ques- 
tions to ask in regard to our people, and they made many compli- 
mentary remarks in regard to what they had already known and 
learned of the Latter-day Saints. So the teachings of the Latter-day 
Saints are reaching to all parts of the land today, and we count those 
men as our friends. I was indeed happy to have the privilege and the 
opportunity of meeting and conversing with them. 

This morning I was talking with President S. O. Bennion ) who 
has charge of the Deseret News. I desired to have him send me 
three copies of the articles that have been published, or rather, the 
radio talks given by Brother Morris in regard to the restoration of the 
Gospel, because there are three different individuals in the East to 
whom I desire to send those copies, as they have asked questions 
along that particular line. 

Not only these three, but there are many others whose curiosity 



106 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



is aroused, and they desire to know more of the teachings of the 
Latter-day Saints. 

So, my brethren and sisters, it is your duty and my duty, 
wherever the opportunity presents itself, to get this message to the 
people of the world, because they are hungering and thirsting after 
truth. They have been in darkness for many, many years, but the 
light is just coming to them. 

I say again I rejoice in the opportunity that I have of raising my 
voice and assisting, in a weak way, in still furthering this cause, al- 
though I am not actively engaged in the ministry at this particular 
time. I am thankful to President Grant and his counselors and the 
members of the Council of the Twelve, for the opportunity that I 
have had of laboring in the ministry, and for the support that they 
gave me while actively engaged. I pray that the Lord will bless 
them with every needful blessing, that they may have the strength 
and the power to carry on this work and magnify their callings in a 
way that will be pleasing to our Heavenly Father. 

God bless you, my brethren and sisters, in all of your righteous 
undertakings here upon the earth. I rejoice in the testimony that I 
have of the divinity of this work, the experience that has come to me 
in my life, that has borne testimony to me that God lives, that Jesus 
Christ is the Savior and the Redeemer of the world, and that the 
Prophet Joseph Smith was the instrument, in the hands of the Al- 
mighty, in establishing his work upon the earth for the last time. It 
will never more be thrown down, nor will it be given to another peo- 
ple. You and I may fall by the wayside, but God will raise up those 
who will carry on this work, until finally his purposes will be consum- 
mated in all the earth. 

May his blessings rest upon all of you, I pray, in the name of 
Jesus Christ, Amen. 



ELDER GUST AVE W. FORSBERG 

Former President of the Szvedish Mission 

My brethren and sisters, I am very much surprised and over- 
whelmed at being called to speak on this occasion. It is eight 
months since I returned from the Swedish Mission. President Grant 
called for me at the last conference, which was held in October, but I 
was not able to attend at that time. 

I am thankful for this privilege to bear my testimony concern- 
ing the truthfulness of this work. I am thankful, my brethren and 
sisters, that I had the privilege and the honor of going into the mis- 
sion field again, and especially for my association with the young 
men that it was my privilege to work with in the mission field. 

There was progress being made in Sweden when we left there 
eight months ago, and I am sure that the work is going forward under 



ELDER GUST AVE W. FORSBERG 



107 



the direction of Brother Hugo D. E. Peterson, who is now presiding 
over the Swedish Mission. 

When President John A. Widtsoe visited us in Sweden in Sep- 
tember, 1933, we were given a lot of publicity by the daily papers. 
They said many good things about the Latter-day Saints, and a 
great change in attitude was noticeable, as compared with thirty 
years earlier when I labored there as a missionary. 

Then again, when President Joseph F. Merrill visited us in May, 
1934, the press was just as liberal in making comments on our meet- 
ings and saying good things about us. So the attitude in Sweden 
has changed a great deal in regard to the Mormons. 

When John H. Taylor was speaking last night in the priesthood 
meeting, relating some of the sacrifices that are made by those who 
fulfil missions, 1 was reminded of a lady missionary who is now in 
Sweden, fulfilling her third mission. When not engaged in mission- 
ary work abroad she has been doing temple work at home. We 
learned that she had spent upwards of $1,000.00 in gathering her 
genealogy, and all her money has been earned through housework. 
This is a testimony to me that there are people even today who are 
willing to make sacrifices in order to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ. 
It is an example to many of us, my brethren and sisters, that should 
encourage us to make sacrifices in order to preach the Gospel, which 
has come to us and which has been such a blessing in our lives. 

I am thankful that my father listened to the testimony of the 
Elders who came to his home and brought this message to him. All 
that I am and all that I have I owe to the Gospel of Jesus Christ. 

The work in Sweden is progressing fairly well. We are making 
no phenomenal progress, but gradual and slow, and each year adds 
new members to the Church. The work of the auxiliary organiza- 
tions has been stressed in the mission, in line with instruction from 
the president of the European mission, and we find that through 
the work of the auxiliary organizations the work of the Church as 
a whole is progressing and making headway. 

I am thankful for the testimony of the Gospel which I have 
gained through my experience in the Church, and I pray that I may 
ever be faithful, that we may all work willingly to advance God's 
purposes. I bear you my testimony that I know that God lives, that 
Jesus is the Christ, that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God, and 
that the men who stand at the head of the Church today are servants 
of God. May we as workers in the Church uphold and sustain 
them, I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER JAMES M. KIRKHAM 

President of the East Central States Mission 

I pray that the Lord will bless me while I stand before you. 
r am very pleased today to represent the five states from which 



108 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



many of your parents, grandparents, and great grandparents came 
— Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina, West Virginia, and Vir- 
ginia. 

It is just one hundred years ago since Wilford Woodruff 
went into Memphis, Tennessee, and then up into Kentucky, 
preaching the Gospel. Two — three — generations have grown up 
since that time. We are preaching today to a new generation. 
Some of the parents of the boys and girls that we have in the 
Mission were preaching there twenty or thirty years ago. 

I would like to add my testimony in regard to the Tabernacle 
Choir. As your sons and daughters go to the door of many a 
home, entrance is given to them by the people because of their 
acquaintance with the broadcasts from this wonderful building. 
These broadcasts are doing a great work. 

I would like to emphasize to you the pleasure and the satis- 
faction that come to these young men and women in the mission 
field, and I would like to stress to you the pleasure that I know 
comes to the homes also of these good young men and women. 
If I had the time I could tell you many a testimony of the great 
and wonderful work that is being accomplished at this end of 
the mission in the way of converting, if you please, members of 
the family to greater activity, and some even to membership in 
the Church; also the blessings that are coming to these good 
homes which provide the means for these young people. 

I recall that only a short time ago two young men within 
two weeks came to me, both with a similar story, a sort of coin- 
cidence, and told me their fathers had lost their jobs and perhaps 
they would have to return home. 

I said: "Have faith. This is the Lord's work." 

Both of these young men, within less than thirty days, came 
back to me and said their parents had other jobs at increased 
salaries. I know that the Lord is blessing us. 

Another man, only yesterday, told me that he had paid off 
more debts since his son had been on a mission than he had 
done for years. The Lord blesses those who have faith in him 
and send their boys and girls into the world. I pray that he will 
stimulate greater action and greater faith in this missionary work. 
We are trying to preach the Gospel," and to preach love, for the 
greatest commandment is to love the Lord and our fellow men. 
We are also trying to preach to those good people and teach 
them the Gospel, that through, obedience to the Gospel they can 
obtain the blessings they desire, and in no other way. 

The Savior says, "If ye love me ye will keep my command- 
ments. And so I think this might apply here at home. The 
greater love we show, the nearer will we live to our Heavenly 
father. 

. 1 have a testimony of the divinity of this work. I have "been 
active m this Church for many years, but at no other time in my 



ELDER JAMES M. KIRKHAM 



109 



life have I had such great satisfaction and pleasure as I am hav- 
ing today, and I believe that one of the reasons for it is that I 
am putting more into it. If you will give the Gospel away, so to 
speak, to your friends and your neighbors you will be blessed. 

I shall never forget the words of President Grant ; I don't 
know whether he remembers them. As I bade him good-bye at 
our last conference he said to me, "President Kirkham, go down 
there and put the people to work." He referred to the members 
of the Church. I can tell him that we have followed his advice 
and benefits are accruing in a number of our branches. It is 
really an inspiration because of the satisfaction that is coming to 
them. They are working, they are holding meetings with their 
neighbors and their friends ; not only are the missionaries preach- 
ing the Gospel, but we are trying to get the members to preach 
the Gospel by their lives, by their actions, and by their words, 
so that they can face their Redeemer and their Judge, and not 
feel guilty because of not having done their part. 

May the Lord bless us in the missionary work, in warning 
the world of the coming judgments upon those who do not serve 
him. Oh, my brethren and sisters, pray for us in this great work, 
that we may do our duty well, and that we shall be successful 
in performing the part that we have been called upon to per- 
form, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

The Tabernacle Choir sang the anthem "Inflammatus," Laurinda P. 
Brewerton, soloist. 

Elder Alfred L. Hanks, President of the* Tooele Stake, offered the 
benediction. 

Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock. 

THIRD DAY 

AFTERNOON SESSION 

The concluding session of the Conference convened at 2 o'clock 
Sunday afternoon, April 7. 

Again the Tabernacle was crowded to capacity with people, and 
thousands of others congregated in the Assembly Hall and on the Taber- 
nacle grounds, where they listened to the Conference proceedings as 
they were broadcast by radio from the Tabernacle. 

The Tabernacle Choir furnished the music for this session. 

An anthem, "Watchmen of Zion," was sung by the Choir, Jessie 
Evans, soloist. 

James Haslam and Rilla W. Peterson sang a duet, "Love Divine." 
Elder T. Clark Callister, President of the Millard Stake, offered the 
opening prayer.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



PRESIDENT DAVID O. McKAY 

Second Counselor in the First Presidency 

As I stand before you this afternoon, my brothers and sisters, my 
heart is humble indeed. This great conference, itself, with all that it 
connotes, makes me feel so. The lofty and thrilling messages in sermon 
and song, the crowded sessions, the largely attended priesthood meeting 
last evening, the very fact that from these Tabernacle grounds this morn- 
ing there radiated messages which touched the hearts of hundreds of 
thousands of our fellow countrymen— these and other outstanding- 
features all combine to heighten in my soul the realization of the world- 
wide significance of the mission of the Church of Jesus Christ. I sense, 
therefore, more keenly than ever before the need of divine inspiration 
and guidance for all who carry responsibility, that each of us may dis- 
charge his duty acceptably. 

THE HOME AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN STABLE GOVERNMENT 

I was particularly pleased with President Clark's message this 
morning regarding the fundamentals of our government. In keeping 
therewith I desire to call attention to the fact that the united, well-ordered 
American home is one of the greatest contributing factors to the preser- 
vation of the Constitution of the United States. It has been aptly said 
that Out of the homes of America will come the future citizens of 
America, and only as those homes are what they should be will this 
nation be what it should be." Of the importance of home and of dangers 
hat threaten the sanctity f marriage, I feel impressed to say a few words 
this afternoon. 

MARRIAGE A DIVINE INSTITUTION 

The exalted view of marriage .as held by this Church is given 
expressively m five words found in the 49th section of the Doctrine and 
Covenants. Marriage is ordained of God." That revelation was given 
in 1831 when Joseph Smith was only twenty-five years of age Consider- 

exl, nl Cl r UmS l anC ? T de Z W . hiGh {t WaS S iven ' we fin d in it another 
example among hundreds of others corroborative of the fact that he was 

inured of the Lord. "Watchmen of Zion, I am trusting you/' waTa

w^^2T nd A ° f W r Chmen in Zi ° n - Presidin S officers i" stakes,

the minds of the young such a standard is a protection to them in court- 
ship, an ever present influence inducing them to refrain from doing any- 
thing which may prevent their going to the Temple to have their love 
consummated in an enduring and eternal union. It will lead them to 
seek divine guidance in the selecting of their companions, upon the wise 
choice of whom their life's happiness here and hereafter is largely depend- 
ent. "Our home joys," says Pestalozzi, "are the most delightful^ earth 
affords, and the joy of parents in their children is the most holy joy of 
humanity. It makes their hearts pure and good ; it lifts them up to their 
Father in Heaven." Such joys are within the reach of most men and 
women if high ideals of marriage and home be properly fostered and 
cherished. 

ENCROACHING DANGERS 

And yet, if I mistake not the signs of the times, the sacredness of the 
marriage covenant is dangerously threatened. There are some who 
question whether family life is permanent as a social organization. They 
claim that marriage ties will be and should be but temporary, that chil- 
dren will be born not in families, but in the life of the state. Recently 
in a trip east I observed to my dismay an increasing number of "Gretna 
Greens," places where the marriage ceremony may be performed at any 
hour of the day or night without any previous arrangement. The 
license is issued and the ceremony performed while the couple wait; 
already I know of at least two couples that have been entrapped by such 
enticements and both cases have ended in disappointment and sorrow. 
In some instances these places are nothing more than opportunities for 
legalized immorality. Oh how far they fall below the true ideal ! As far 
as lies within our power, we must warn young couples against secret 
and hasty marriages. 

It is vital also to counteract the insidious influences of printed 
literature that speaks of the "bankruptcy of marriage," that advocates 
trial marriages, and that places "extra-marital relations" on a par with 
"extra-marital friendships." 

I need say little about the growing evil of divorce and the resultant 
broken homes. You know that it is almost as easy to get a divorce 
as it is to get married. Today, one out of five marriages in the United 
States ends in divorce or annulment. One of the peace officers in Salt 
Lake reported recently that eighty-six per cent of the delinquent cases 
come from such broken homes. America seems to be drifting toward 
a low level as regards the law of family and home, with the result that 
sin and crime are increasing to an alarming extent among the youth of 
our fair land. 

I mention these things not in the spirit of pessimism nor as a crier 
of impending calamity, but with the desire to call attention to the necessity 
of our maintaining the high standard of marriage set forth in the reve- 
lations of the Lord.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



RESPONSIBILITY OF PARENTHOOD 

Equal in importance to the high conception of the marriage covenant 
is the teaching of the Church in regard to the responsibility of parent- 
hood : 

Inasmuch as parents have children in Zion or in any of her stakes which are 
organized, that teach them not to understand the doctrine of repentance, faith in 
Christ the Son of the living God, and of baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost 
by the laying, on of the hands, when eight years old, the sin be upon the heads of 
the parents. (D. & C. 69:25.) 

Parenthood and particularly motherhood should be held as a sacred 
obligation. There is something in the depths of the human soul which 
revolts against neglectful parenthood. Recently an incident occurred in 
one of the European countries which illustrates how the sense of human- 
ity is injured when a mother selfishly and wilfully fails to take care 
of her children. When I read that capital punishment had been meted 
out to such a woman I thought that the state was almost barbarous, but 
really it was not the execution of the law that was so terrible- but the 
woman herself who by cruel neglect of her children committed the crime 
against humanity. How deep-seated is this soul condemnation of one 
who will sacrifice a child for her own indulgence or even to save her 
own life is impressively set forth by Robert Browning in his dramatic 
idyll, descriptive of a mother who had to pay the extreme penalty for 
having lived to tell the story of her children's death. 

A mother bears a child: perfection is complete 
So far in such a birth. Enabled to repeat 
The miracle of life,— herself was born so just 
A type of womankind, that God sees fit to trust 
Her with the holy task of giving life in turn. 

****** 
How say you, should the hand of God trusted with life's torch 

Kindled to light the world aware of sparks that scorch, 

Let fall the same? Forsooth, her flesh a fireflake stings- 
• The mother drops the child ! Among what monstrous things 
Shall she be classed? , 

****** 

The fox-dam, hunger-pined, will slay the felon sire 

VxS? ?- ares . assault her whel P : the beaver . stretched on fire 
Will die without a groan; no pang avails to wrest

What :s.here then? Answer me, thou dead one, as I trow, 
Standing at God's bar, he bids thee answer now ! 

tf,i r XtT ^ e d ™ atic Presentation, but it illustrates that some- 

thing which God has implanted deep in every human breast that parents 
cannot with impunity shirk the responsibility to protect childhood and

PRESIDENT DAVID O. McKAY 



113 



vigilance, companionship, being watchmen of our own children, are neces- 
sary in order to keep our homes intact. 

The fact cannot be too strongly emphasized that the real source of 
security of our nation rests in the well-ordered and properly conducted 
home. The character of the child is formed largely during the first 12 
years of his life. It is estimated that in that period the child spends 16 
times as many waking hours in the home as in school, and more than 
100 times as many hours in the home as in the church. Every child is 
to a great degree, what he is because of the ever constant influence of 
home environment and the careful or neglectful training of parents. 

"Teach the child self-respect," says Luther Burbank, the great 
plant-wizard. "Train it in self-respect, just as you train a plant in better 
ways. No self-respecting man is ever a grafter. Above all, bear in mind 
repetition, the use of an influence over and over again, keeping ever- 
lastingly at it. This is what fixes traits in plants, the constant repetition 
of an influence, until at last it is irrevocably fixed and will not change. 
You cannot afford to get discouraged. You are dealing with something 
far more precious than a plant — the precious soul of a child." 

THREE THINGS TO WHICH EVERY CHILD IS ENTITLED 

There are three fundamental things to which every child is entitled. 
First, a respected name; second, a sense of security; third, opportunities 
for development. 

The family gives to the child his name and standing in the com- 
munity. A child wants his family to be as good as those of his friends. 
He wants to be able to point with pride to his father and feel an inspira- 
tion every time 'he looks at his mother. It is a mother's duty so to live 
that her children will associate with her everything that is beautiful, 
sweet and pure. And fathers, even the poorest of us, from a financial 
standpoint, may so conduct our lives as to be able to say to our sons in 
the words of a poet : 

I have no wealth to leave) you, and no fame. 
This must be your inheritance : my name. . . . 
(In interest of brevity not read but now added) 
T have tried to make my name synonymous 
In all mens' minds, with things the most worthwhile ; 
With strength to do the right, though none might see me ; 
With grit to meet disaster with a smile ; 
With loyalty to those with claims upon me ; 
With justice equally toward foe and friend; 
With honor, truth, integrity, square dealing — 
"My word my bond." 

Now, as I reach the end, 
K Too well I know that I have failed in efforts 

Where I have wanted greatly to succeed ; 
Too oft I've seen my dreams, bright in the forming, 
Prove naught but vain imaginings, indeed. 
But this I do believe : when I have traveled 
Life's twisting road, and worked out Life's great plan, — 



114 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



When I have gone beyond life's praise or blaming — 
It will be said of me, "He was a man." 
And so, because of this, I feel no shame 
When I bequeath to you, my son, my name. 

SENSE OF SECURITY 

In regard to the sense of security, every child is entitled to food, 
shelter and raiment, and he should feel in his home a safe and comfortable 
protection from the outside world. "He needs parents who are happy in 
their adustment to each other, who are working hopefully toward the 
fulfilment of an ideal of living, who love their children with a sincere 
and unselfish love." Regarding economic security the report of the White 
House Conference on Child Health and Protection says : 

Fundamental to the very existence of family is its economic status— its 
ability to provide an adequate income and to expend it wisely. A basic income 
should be within the attainment of each family to insure the minimum standard 
for survival and security. This is an economic problem of national scope. A na- 
tion that values its future development will take steps to see that this 'basic income 
at least is available to all its people. Only then can we demand of all families the 
observance of those methods of child care upon which child health and protection 
depend. 

In this phase of family life the Church can render excellent service. 
No other organization in the world is so well prepared to know the 
physical and economic condition of each person as is the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Now is an opportune time for the 
Church to demonstrate its efficiency not only in knowing the needs of the 
destitute but in supplying their needs. 

SUPPLEMENTING THE HOME 

In teaching children, it should ever be kept in mind that "Behavior 
is caught, not taught." Example is more potent than precept. Parents 
have the duty to be what they would have their children become in regard 
to courtesy^ smcerity, temperance, and courage to do right at all times. 

While it is true that "we need not power or splendor, wide hall or 
lordly > dome, the good, the true, the tender— these form the wealth of 
home, yet the fact remains that there are certain material and cultural 
needs which are indispensable to successful home life. During the 
present crisis, to prevent the breaking up of homes, these material needs 
must be furnished by the group, either through the Church or the state. 
Here is where the complete organization of the Church should function 
most adequately. The material as well as the spiritual needs of everv 
tamily m the Church should not only be known as I have already stated, 
but supplied by the bishopric of the ward either directly or indirectlv 
In a superior and effective manner the Church can also and does supply 
■cultural needs such as education, social intercourse, music, etc These 
may be obtained by every child, every youth, every person in the Church 
who will avail himself or herself of the opportunities offered. I wonder 
if parents generally are doing all they can to see to it that their boys 



PRESIDENT DAVID' O. McKAY 



115 



and girls are members of quorums and auxiliaries, organized for the 
express purpose of supplementing the home in the training of youth. 
Fifty thousand men and women are offering their services free of charge 
to give social and moral instruction and above all religious instruction to 
our toys and girls free. It is our duty to cooperate with them for the 
protection of our own children. 

With the divinity of our marriage covenant, and the responsibility of 
parenthood ever in our minds, with temple marriage as an ideal for every 
worthy couple in the Church, we associate with courtship and marriage 
the most sublime ideals that influence human relations. 

LISTS SAFEGUARDS 

That youth may experience in anticipation and realization all the 
joy that can be found in a congenial and heaven-blessed home life, they 
and we should be guided by the following safeguards : 

First, substitute the present tendency toward a low view of marriage 
by the high ideal which God has given it. Choose your mate not alone 
for physical attraction, but for congenial and spiritual companionship. 

Second, let us teach the young of both sexes in the sacredness of 
the ideals of marriage, so that they may realize that marriage involves 
obligations and is not an arrangement to be terminated at pleasure. In 
this regard, it is the duty of parents to set an example in the home that 
children may see and absorb as it were the sacredness of family and the 
responsibility associated therewith. 

Third, instruct young girls in the fundamental arts of housekeeping 
so that when the responsibilities of wifehood come, they 'may be free 
from the difficulties and perplexities which arise from ignorance and 
inexperience. 

Fourth, let the marriage be so solemnized, as far as possible, at the 
place of residence, which will minimize the evils that follow runaway 
marriages. For members of the Church the Temple should be the chosen 
place in which this sacred obligation is assumed. 

Fifth, foster the spirit of true religion from the very beginning of 
home life. 

Sixth, teach the young that the foundation of a happy marriage 
is laid before the bride and bridegroom kneel at the altar. Keep the spring 
of life pure and the stream will more likely flow on unpolluted. 

HOME BUILDING PARAMOUNT 

Would you have a strong and virile nation, keep your homes pure — 
would you reduce delinquency and crime, lessen the number of broken 
homes. It is time that civilized peoples realized that prevention is more 
profitable than punishment, and that the home is the incubator either of 
children of high character or of criminals. Home building, therefore, 
should be the paramount purpose of parents and of the nation. Tn "Home, 
The Savior of Civilization," we read : 

When one puts business or pleasure above his home, he that moment starts on 



116 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



the down grade to soul ruin. The loss of fortune is nothing compared with the loss 
of home. When the club becomes more attractive to any man than his home, it is 
time for him to confess in bitter siiame that he has failed to measure up to the 
supreme opportunity of his life and has flunked in the final test of true manhood. 
No other success can compensate for failure in the home. This is the one thing 
of limitless potentialities on earth. The poorest shack of a home in which love 
prevails over a united family is of greater value to God and future humanity 
than the richest bank on earth. In such a home God can work miracles and will 
work miracles. The greatest miracle that King Herod ever saw was John the 
Baptist. The religious, home, though poor, produced John the Baptist. The most 
dazzling miracle of all history is Jesus of Nazareth. His education was that of 
a united religious home. Pure hearts in a pure home are always in whispering 
distance of heaven. In such a home there is always a key which one' may use in 
opening the reservoirs of the infinite and start a Pentecost. The great, good God 
who made this world ordained man and woman for the home and He is seeing 
to it that they may search the whole world over, but will never find the sweetest 
joys of life anywhere but in the home. In obedience to God's law for human 
life, one should make it his highest ambition to build an ideal home. Make home 
your hobby, for, if anyone makes a loving home with all his heart, he can never 
miss heaven. 

MARRIAGE ORDAINED OF GOD 

Verfly I say unto you that whoso forbiddeth to marry is not ordained of God, 
for marriage is ordained of God unto man. Wherefore, it is lawful that he should 
have one wife, and they twain shall be one flesh, and all this that the earth might 
answer the end of its creation. 

I repeat, "It is lawful that he should have one wife," and that 
harmony, unity and blessed confidence should pervade the home. I 
emphasize this part of the revelation so that you watchmen of the priest- 
hood will see to it that a group of misguided men and women now hiding 
behind a sanctimonious claim to possess superior knowledge regarding 
the marriage covenant, do not betray innocent young men and women 
into unlawful and unholy alliances. 

God guide and inspire us to keep intact the true Latter-day Saint 
home, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 

Of the Council of the Tzvelve Apostles 

THUS ON TO ETERNAL PERFECTION 

I shall begin my remarks with a quotation from that masterpiece 
of literature and doctrine— the Sermon on the Mount: 

_ Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbor, and hate 
thine enemy. 

But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good 
you y ° U ' Pray f ° r thCm Whi ° h des P itefull y use y° u . and Persecute 

That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven : for he maketh 
Ins sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the 
unjust. 

For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the 
publicans the same? 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 



117 



And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not 
even the publicans so? 

Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect. 

—Matthew 5 :43-48. 

RELIGION, THE WORLDS GREATEST NEED 

The greatest need of the world today is religion — the religion 
of unselfishness, the religion of Jesus that teaches, "Thou shalt love 
thy neighbor as thyself." (Matt. 22:39) "Be ye perfect," etc. The 
unceasing influence of the Church for good is like a cord attached to 
the feet which continues always to bring back into that straight, that 
narrow way any who have deviated to the right or to the left, how- 
ever great or however slight the deviation. 

Scholarship has no- such pull. Science, literature and the arts 
cannot take the place of religion. While religion never ceases to 
exert a powerful influence for good, nevertheless it takes a tremend- 
ous amount of it to keep us, with our many human frailties, doing 
our best all the time. 

When Jesus said, "Be ye perfect," he set for us a difficult task. 
It is the aim of the Church to keep us on the way to perfection insofar 
as unceasing vigilance can do this. I shall mention a few of the 
practises of the Church which help greatly in this respect. 

TESTIMONY — -EXAMINATION MEETINGS 

One of these is a sort of annual examination or testimony meet- 
ing stake presidents are advised to hold with the members of their 
high councils, their bishops and other stake and ward workers who 
do their church work under the immediate direction of the stake 
presidency. 

And all other stakes and ward officers, including of course the 
bishops, are advised to hold similar meetings with those who labor 
under their direction. In fact all Church officers and workers in 
every department, including those in auxiliary activities, are to be 
checked up at least once each year to find out with what degree of 
success we are, with our mortal imperfections, succeeding in our ef- 
forts to be better all the time. 

_ May I illustrate what I mean by such an examination. The most 
rigid I ever had to take was given by Francis M. Lyman. He con- 
ducted the examinations for a group to which '1 belonged and over 
which he presided much as Benjamin Franklin proceeded with his 
examination of himself. 

Franklin said he knew or thought he knew right from wrong 
and he did not see why he might not always do the one and avoid the 
other. But he soon found that he had undertaken a task of more 
difficulty than he had imagined. However, in his practical way, 
Franklin made a list of thirteen virtues and by placing particular 
emphasis upon one of these at a time, he expected to be able to 



118 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



master that, and then proceed to another. By repeated efforts he planned 
to go on thus to perfection. 

TESTS BY CHURCH STANDARDS 

In much the same way Francis M. Lyman in his testimony and 
examination meetings named as best he could all the Church stand- 
ards in accordance with which Latter-day Saints are expected to live. 
He referred to the payment of tithing, the keeping- f the Word of 
Wisdom, attendance at sacrament meetings, observance of family 
and secret prayers, etc. He asked if the members of the organization 
were good husbands and fathers and neighbors. Lie advised that 
they speak ill of no man, not even in a matter of truth, but rather 
excuse the faults charged against others, and upon proper occasions, 
speak all the good they knew of everybody. He asked if they were 
good citizens, that is, if they took a proper interest in public affairs. 
He wanted to know if they were frugal and if they paid their obliga- 
tions promptly. He insisted that it is the duty of Church members 
when employed to live within their means, to try to be better off 
financially at the end of the year than at its beginning, etc. In brief, 
like Franklin, he hoped to have all the people struggle toward per- 
fection all the time. 

''all these things have i kept" 

We were all impressed with the effectiveness of these examina- 
tions when on one occasion a man arose and said, "I have no dif- 
ficulty in living according to the Word of Wisdom, it is easy for 
me to attend sacrament meetings and to remember with regularity 
my secret and family prayers. I have no trouble living within my 
income. I am better off financially today than I was a year ago. 
In fact," he continued, using almost the exact language of the Bible^ 
"all these things have I kept from my youth up, but I have one great 
weakness, an uncontrollable temper." 

At the meeting we sang the familiar number, "Scatter Seeds of 
Kindness," which in part is as follows : 

If we knew the baby fingers, 

Pressed against the window pane, 
Would be cold and stiff tomorrow — 

Never trouble us again — 
Would the bright eyes of our darling 

Catch the frown upon our brow ? 
Would the prints of rosy fingers 

Vex us then as they do now? 

Ah! those little ice-cold fingers, 

How they point our mem'ries back 
To the hasty words and actions 

Strewn along our backward track! 
How those little hands remind us, 

As in snowy grace they lie, 
Not to scatter thorns — but roses — 

For our reaping by and by. 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 



119 



It was after hearing the harmony of this impressive song, glori- 
fied by the sweet tenor voice of George R. Emery, the leader, that 
our associate, our brother, with the tears flowing down his cheeks, 
said : "My great trouble is my temper. But I am struggling with it 
and I am glad to be 'able to report that during the past year I think 
I have made some progress." 

PERFECTION THROUGH RELIGION 

Thus a human soul was striving successfully to do that which 
real religion demands, namely, that we do our best to reach perfec- 
tion. 

It is doubtful if science, literature, art, scholarship, any one or all 
of these combined, can stir a mortal heart to put forth such strenuous 
eflort as that, for the sole purpose of making a human being stronger 
and better. Only religion, the Gospel of Jesus Christ as revealed 
through the Prophet Joseph Smith, can do it. 

SEVEN EXAMINATIONS 

Another of the outstanding practises in the Church intended to 
make its members more nearly perfect is our way of advancing boys 
and young men in the priesthood. Our aim is to teach and train them 
to expect that at least seven times in their lives, if they are regularly 
promoted in the Church, they will find themselves alone with the 
bishop for the purpose of being given a kind and fatherly examina- 
tion. The first comes when the boy is to be ordained a deacon, the 
second before he is ordained a teacher, the third before he is ordained 
a priest, fourth, before he is ordained an elder, fifth, when he is 
sent into the mission field, sixth, when he makes application to go 
into the temple, and seventh, when he is ready to take some charming- 
young woman with him to the altar for his marriage ceremony. 

These seven examinations are to consist of questions concerning 
details of Church duties and conduct, such as attitude toward to- 
bacco, tea, coffee, liquor, tithing, keeping the Sabbath day holy, at- 
tending to secret and family prayers, being just and fair and charit- 
able 1 and patient in all dealings with neighbors and business associ- 
ates. One question to be emphasized especially is "Have you lived 
in accordance with the Scout oath or promise, especially that part of 
it which says, 'On my honor I will do my best to keep myself physic- 
ally strong, mentally awake and morally straight.' " Emphasis is 
placed especially on the last portion. Wise men have said if the 
Church can bring up a generation of men and women who all their 
days walk with accuracy in the path of virtue, then to such a genera 
tion nothing will be impossible. 

ORDAINED ELDERS AT NINETEEN 

And now, beginning with this year 1935, in addition to the 
seven exacting examinations above referred to, an additional pro- 



120 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



cedure for the guidance and protection of boys and young- men has 
been adopted. I refer to the new and definite policy of ordaining 
young men elders when they reach the age nineteen. 

It has been' the practise for years to ordain boys deacons when 
they are twelve, and now with the same unanimity and persistence 
worthy young men are to be ordained elders at nineteen. 

Dr. Karl G. Maeser used to say to us his normal students, "You 
are being trained and educated to teach and I want you to know and 
to remember that if 95 % of the members of any class do not finish 
the course with a passing grade there is something the matter with 
the teacher." 

And so I say, if 95 % of our young folks at age nineteen are not 
worthy, and the young men cannot therefore be ordained elders, 
make a careful survey of the situation and I predict you will find 
something wrong with the teaching or the training in the home or in 
the Church or in both of these. 

The plan is to have all young men at nineteen become by ordina- 
tion full-fledged men, to have thus put upon them the stamp of man- 
hood, the stamp of character, the stamp of dependability. We want 
this ordination to be made a sort of commencement or graduation. 
It will indicate that the course begun at twelve is completed not only 
with credit but with honor as well. 

SATISFYING A NATURAL CRAVING 

You know when a boy is twelve nature fills him with visions of 
and ambition for the future. He begins to long for the company and 
fellowship and leadership of men, to desire to break away from his 
childhood surroundings. He wants to run away from home. He 
begins to hear nature's cry for association with grown-ups. It is the 
awakening of ambition in the soul of the boy. At his age practically 
all our boys are ordained deacons and enter the Mutual Improvement 
Association. 'In his M. I. A. work a boy is made a Scout and can be 
accepted as a member of the National Scout organization. 

In order to satisfy that natural demand, that craving for the 
association of men, we are not only requesting, but urging that a 
strong troop committee, a committee of developed, powerful men, 
the strongest available, be appointed by all the bishops in all the 
wards. 

The outstanding business of a troop committee is two-fold: 
First, to provide well-trained men to be Scoutmasters, assistant 
Scoutmasters, and leaders and associates for these boys. Second, 
to provide in some way or other whatever money is necessary to 
make the troop in every ward outstandingly successful. 

YOUTH TO BE GUARDED 

The prime aim and purpose of our program is to preserve young- 
people from temptation, to protect them from evil. The Church 
stands strongly for purity rather than for repentance. 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN

Is it not providential that this broad and intense training be- 
gins at the age of twelve? Remember Jesus was twelve when 
after three days his parents found him in the temple sitting in the 
midst of the doctors, the wise men of his day and time, both hearing 
them and asking them questions. Even Jesus at this age was hun- 
gering apparently for the association of men. 

While I have been emphasizing the responsibility of preserving 
the boys and young men frqm evil and temptation as this responsi- 
bility rests upon the bishops and their associates, I desire to make it 
clear that great and perhaps greatest of all is the responsibility which 
rests upon the parents. The home must do its part, and often that 
part can be done best by the mothers. Men may fail but women 
never, is one of my favorite expressions. 

From the Improvement Era I learned that one stake was or- 
ganizing the mothers to help with the training of these young men 
and boys. If organized, the mothers of the deacons, the mothers of 
the teachers, the mothers of the priests, and the mothers of the Scouts 
can do more than any others in helping to train these boys so that 
at the age of nineteen they will be worthy men, noble, fine, young 
fellows, who can consistently be ordained elders. 

The forces of all our organizations are thus combined to bring 
not only our boys but our girls also through their boyhood and girl- 
hood into manhood and womanhood from age twelve to age nineteen 
as nearly perfect as possible. 

With united ranks, we go forward singing, "Thus on to eternal 
perfection the honest and faithful will go." 

The congregation and choir sang the hymn, "Do What is Right." 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

As usual we are short of time. We shall not call on Bishop Syl- 
vester Q. Cannon to speak to us as he addressed us in the General 
Priesthood meeting yesterday evening. We shall ask Elder Samuel 
O. Bennion and Bishop John Wells to each speak to us for ten min- 
utes. 

ELDER SAMUEL O. BENNION 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

One of the outstanding events of recent occurrence, if not an 
epochal experience in history, was the radio service held a few 
nights ago in which the President of the Church and the Prophet of 
the Lord greeted members of the Church and all others who were 
listening in in all the world where radio connections are made. 

I am sure that no one can accuse the Church of Jesus Christ of 



122 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Latter-day Saints of neglecting its duty. For years the word of the 
Lord has gone forth from this country into all parts of the world. 
A solid history has been written for a hundred years. Sermons have 
been delivered, tracts have been distributed, books have been placed 
in the homes and in the hands of the people, that all men might re- 
ceive a testimony of Jesus Christ. 

Now, in the present day, with the wonderful achievements of 
modern discoveries, we are able to reach the hearts of the children of 
men in nearly all parts of the world in just a few moments of time. 
Truly it is a marvelous age in which we live, and the Church marches 
on. 

The promise made by the Savior is still in effect. He said : 

My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me. If any man will do his will, 
he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself. 

I know of no authority having been given to any man to make 
any change in the doctrines of our Eternal Father's Son. He preached 
the Gospel while he ministered in the earth, he established a Church 
with prophets and apostles, and gave unto the world a true order of 
worship. Paul the apostle explains the necessity and purpose of the 
Church organization : 

And he gave some, apostles ; and some, prophets ; and some, evangelists ; and 
some, pastors and teachers ; 

For the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edi- 
fying of the body of Christ : 

Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son 
of God. 

In my experience in life I have not been able to find that anyone 
has had the right to change the plan established by the Savior during 
his ministry, and restored in our day. 

I have often asked men and women to review the history of the 
Church as well as the doctrines, and see if they do not comply with 
the principles that our Eternal Father taught through his Son. If 
men and women would lay aside personal prejudices and seek for the 
things that the Lord has revealed they could not but be convinced 
of the truth ! I appeal to people to listen in fairness to the doctrines 
of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. They do not 
belong to us— they belong to our Eternal Father and his Son, whom 
he sent into the world. 

As I stated before, this Church has distributed for a hundred 
years millions of pages of literature setting forth our views and our 
beliefs, without asking men to do anything except to repent, to 
change their lives if they are doing wrong, to investigate the Gospel 
as we see it, to ascertain if there is a need for prophets and apostles, 
and to learn if any revelation ever came from God to man to do away 
with the plan that he ordained. If I were a non-member looking 
for the Church that would give me an inheritance in the kingdom of 



ELDER SAMUEL O. BENNION

God,. I would most certainly look for one that offered me every op- 
portunity to know the truth, to know what it means to live in the 
earth, and what it means to accept a plan which would take me back 
into the presence of God if I kept his commandments. 

I have never found anything in all 'history that fills these re- 
quirements as does the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
It gives to every man and woman who enters it the same opportunity 
regardless of where they live or where they come from. It is for 
all and no one has any right over the other. It teaches us the plan 
of our great Redeemer ; it acquaints us with the history of Joseph 
Smith, the Prophet, and those who have followed him. 

To men and women who may hear my voice, who are not mem- 
bers of the Church, again I plead with you to investigate, while you 
are in this life, the workings of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints; lay aside prejudices of every kind; get acquainted with 
the doctrines, and read the word of God. It has brought joy and 
satisfaction to thousands of souls. It will do it to you. It will bring 
to you a happiness that you have never known before. It will bring 
to you eternal life in the kingdom of our Father. 

This is my testimony to.yott and I bear it in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JOHN WELLS 

Second Counselor in the Presiding Bishopric 

Ever since the Manti choir sang the beautiful hymn, "Lord We 
Come Before Thee Now," this verse has been in my mind : 

Send some message from Thy Word, 
That may joy and peace afford; 
Comfort those who weep and mourn, 
Let "the time of love" return. 

I have repeated these words many times as my brethren have 
spoken and they have left comfort, understanding, and faith in my heart 
and an added appreciation for my membership in the Church and for 
this great latter-day work. 

I desire to call attention to an incident in the life of the Master, 
which is recorded in the 17th chapter of Luke. The Master was 
traveling towards Jerusalem. He passed through Galilee and Sa- 
maria and entered a certain village where he was met by ten lepers. 
A leper could not enter nor live in a village or town. Hence these 
unfortunate creatures accosted the Master while he was still outside 
the village. Misery had broken down all race prejudice, for we find 
the Samaritan and the Jew among these ten unfortunates. No doubt 
they had heard of the wonderful works of the Master. They stood 
afar off and cried, "Jesus, Master, have mercy on us." 

The Master, full of sympathy and love for suffering humanity, 
sent hope into the hearts of these ten men in these words, "Go, show 



124 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



yourselves to the priests," and as they went they discovered that 
they were healed. 

The scriptures say, "And one of them, when he saw he was 
healed, turned back and with a loud voice glorified God and fell 
down on his face at the Master's feet j giving him thanks, and he was 
a Samaritan." 

The Master said, "Were there not ten cleansed? But where are 
the nine?" None returned to give glory to God and thank their 
benefactor for a deliverance from worse than death, save this Sa- 
maritan. 

Brother George Teasdale on one occasion said, "Ingratitude is 
such a heinous offense that nobody ever admitted being guilty of 
it." I have always remembered his comment on ingratitude. On the 
other hand, gratitude is a state of being grateful, having a feeling 
of thankfulness for benefits or kindnesses received and grateful senti- 
ments toward a benefactor. 

Great changes are taking place in our civilization. We are 
passing through serious situations. Unemployment and drouth 
have become serious problems and have affected many of our people. 
Some have become dissatisfied. It is not easy for a man to keep 
happy when his family is in need. The Church has done much to 
relieve the suffering and distress of its members. 

My brethren and sisters, in spite of all these trying conditions, 
there is reason to be thankful to our Father in heaven for the many 
blessings which we still enjoy. While many of the things which I 
shall mention have already been referred to during this conference, 
I think it not amiss to reiterate them in this closing session that we 
may cherish a deep sense of appreciation for our blessings. 

We are living in the most important age of the world's history— 
the dispensation of the fulness of times— a day of the restitution of all 
things spoken by the mouths of holy prophets since the world began. 
Prophets of old have looked forward to this. day- and have longed to 
see it. Is it not a privilege to live in this day when great world move- 
ments preparatory to the coming of the Son of God are in progress ? 

We are living in a choice land, a land choice above all other 
lands, which is reserved for the people of God. As long as we keep 
his commandments, the Lord has said we shall prosper in this land. 
It is a land of freedom. Liberty and democracy still prevail. The 
Latter-day Saints were directed to these valleys of the mountains by 
living prophets of God. In vision, President Brighajm Young be- 
held this place, and when with his natural eyes he saw the valley, he 
said, "This is the place." Here in these mountain valleys we have 
been gathered to develop the highest type of civilization the world 
has ever known, in preparation for the coming of the Savior. 

God has again spoken from the heavens. True knowledge of 
the personality of the Godhead has been revealed. A great prophet 
has arisen. The Prophet Joseph Smith stands at the head of this 
dispensation. The Gospel, the science of salvation, has been re- 



ELDER JOHN WELLS 



125 



stored. It is the source of all man's spiritual and temporal g-uidance. 
The Book of Mormon, a new witness for God, which contains the 
fulness of the everlasting Gospel, has been translated by the gift and 
power of God. The priesthood, the power to legitimately act in the 
name of God, together with all necessary gifts, powers and blessings, 
has been restored. Thousands upon thousands have received this 
priesthood. It was an inspiring sight on Saturday evening to see 
more than six thousand brethren gathered in this building at the 
General Priesthood meeting. 

We are here to accomplish God's purposes, to become a great 
and mighty people, not in wealth, but in faith and power to do good. 
We are engaged in the most important work in the world's history! 
It is our privilege to assist in the establishment of God's work upon 
the earth. . 

It is our privilege to listen to the voice of prophets, apostles and 
leaders of this Church and hear from them the living word of God, 
for they speak to us under the power and influence of the Holv 
Spirit. 

Have we not much for which to be thankful ? Our hearts should 
be filled with gratitude for the privilege of living in this time, in 
this place, with the Gospel of Jesus Christ as our heritage, and for 
prophets of God to lead us, and that we are permitted to assist in 
bringing about the purposes of the Lord. 

No matter what our surroundings and circumstances may be, 
let us hold fast to our living faith. Let not our ideals be wrested 
from us. Let us contemplate often our blessings and hold fast to the 
enduring things of life, that which will bring us riches of soul— the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ. 

May we cultivate gratitude. The spirit of gratitude always 
brings happiness. If we have this virtue we are more God-like. May 
we cultivate a thankful attitude towards God and our fellowmen. 
We will express our thankfulness for our blessings to our Father in 
heaven in daily prayer and show our love for him by keeping his com- 
mandments, in giving service in his cause, in contributing of our 
means for furthering his work, and in praise and song. The spirit 
of gratitude will grow in our hearts as we express it, and it will be 
^eliminated and grow in the hearts of those about us. Let us teach 
it m our homes to our children, that they may grow up with thank- 
ful hearts, that the spirit of discontent and unrest which is in the 
world may not affect their lives. Let us follow the advice given in 
our song, "Count Your Many Blessings": 

When upon life's billows you are tempest tossed, 
When you are discouraged, thinking all is lost, 
Count your many blessings, name them one by one, 
And it will surprise you, what the Lord hath done'. 

May we, like the Samaritan, have grateful hearts and glorify 
God for our blessings, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ELDER JAMES M. PETERSON 

President of the Texas Mission 

I have been delighted, my brethren and sisters, as I know you have, 
with the splendid things of this conference. My heart has been touched 
with the testimonies given us by the General Authorities. I have been 
. given new courage to go on in the tasks assigned to me in this great work, 
as I know you have. The thing that I think has touched me most in 
this conference is the statement that was read in the first session by 
President McKay relating to the growth and development of the Church. 
That statement reminded me of the words of one of the Book of Mormon 
prophets to the effect that man is that he might have joy. 

My heart rejoices that more people are coming into this great 
Church, that their lives may be made better and happier, because in the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ there is happiness, there is joy — that joy which 
we can obtain through no other labor. I rejoice in the growth and ad- 
vancement of the Church. 

I am grateful beyond expression, my brethren and sisters, that I 
have been called into the service, if I may make that statement. I have 
been in the service a great many years, but for a year or more not in 
direct activity. I am so grateful that my brethren of the General Author- 
ities found me worthy to go into the world to preach the Gospel, the mes- 
sage of savlation and of life. I cannot tell you how grateful I am for 
this confidence and I feel that no greater blessing can come to anyone. 

God bless us that we may be faithful in this great work and valiant 
in carrying forward the banner of truth, that his blessings may guide 
and direct us in all our endeavors to further his work, I pray in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER NICHOLAS G. SMITH 

President of the California Mission 

My brethren and sisters, I am orthodox. I believe in Jesus Christ. 
I believe in Joseph Smith, and I know that I understand the Savior's 
life better because of that which has come to me through the Prophet 
Joseph Smith. I believe just as sincerely and truly in Heber J. Grant. I 
have known him personally for years, and I know that Joseph Smith 
was no greater in doing his work than President Grant is in doing his. 
I have been inspired by his utterances. I have marveled at his strength, 
at his kindness, and at the manner in which he has stood as our prophet, 
seer and revelator. 

I believe in being obedient to this Church and to this doctrine, for 
I know that as was said of old by Isaiah, "If ye be willing and obedient 
ye shall eat the good of the land." Therefore, I know that those who are 
faithful and true in the performance of their duties in this Church shall 
not be crushed by this depression. They shall be happy and in their 
families love shall abide. 



ULDER NICHOLAS G. SMITH 127 

• 

For the past sixty months I have been sending out into the world 
approximately $50.00 a month to my two sons as they have performed 
missionary labors in far-off lands — $3000.00. A tremendous sum it 
seems to me and far more, I think, than any man should send to his son 
to maintain him while performing missionary labors, but it was the 
custom — so much was necessary in certain missions. I have thought of 
the words of our Savior when he sent forth his apostles to preach with- 
out purse or scrip, and I find as I read in the 84th Section of the Doc- 
trine and Covenants that in our day God gave the same counsel and ad- 
vice to his servants through the Prophet Joseph Smith, that we should 
go to the nations of the earth and preach the Gospel without purse or 
scrip. I am reminded that a few days ago in a missionary report meet- 
ing in the California Mission, after each of the missionaries had ex- 
pressed himself and told what it had cost him to live during the past 
months, one of them said: "Since I have been here I have had five 
pairs of garments given to me by my own people. My father and mother 
are dead, but I love this Church and I knew that inasmuch as the Christ 
had said that we were to preach the Gospel without purse or scrip it 
could be done. I have marveled as the months have passed by that my 
shirts have outlasted the shirts of my companions, my suit has outlasted 
the suits of my companions ; and during the two years that I have been 
serving in this mission I have not received a cent from any of my peo- 
ple. I have preached the Gospel without purse or scrip, President Smith, 
and I want to stay here as long as you want me to stay here and con- 
tinue to serve because I have been blessed." 

I noted his appearance — the best dressed man we had in the room. 

Then his district president arose and said, "I want to bear testi- 
mony to what Elder Rolfe has just said. I want to tell you that I have 
had four suits while he has had the one which he is now wearing. I 
spend $25.00 a month and he has spent nothing. Now I have been noti- 
fied that my money is finished, but I want to volunteer now, President 
Smith, to stay another six months and be permitted to serve as this loyal 
man has served, without purse or scrip, in this great cause." 

Brethren and sisters, where do you think these men got such ideas ? 
They have lived in that mission under the inspiration of the man who 
formerly presided there, Elder Alonzo A. Hinckley. They believed 
what he taught them — they believed in God, and they knew that God 
would sustain and support them, and so they have gone forth. The 
missionaries now are getting along on $10 a month and less. Some are 
spending $25.00, but we are encouraging them to stay within $10.00. 
The lady missionaries naturally need more. The Lord has blessed them 
and been with them, and the spirit of Alonzo A. Hinckley shall never die 
so long as there is a California Mission. God bless that mission. I 
thank the brethren for honoring me and permitting me to go there. I 
• am grateful to you for your faith and prayers. Your boys and girls are 
doing a wonderful work. The Lord is with them. May his spirit ever 
be with his Church, is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

A young man who claims to have counted the audience at our 
meetings from day to day announces that there are 8,029 people here 
this afternoon, and that there have been in this building during the 
conference sessions 50,562 people. I hope he is correct. 

I should be very pleased if I had the time to make some remarks, 
but by the time the choir has sung an anthem and the closing prayer 
has been offered the radio will be disconnected, and it would not 
be fair to the people who are listening to the radio broadcast for me 
to try to say anything and they not hear it. I offer my apologies to 
the leading brethren who are here who expected to speak but did not 
have an opportunity to do so. 

GRATEFUL FOR BLESSINGS OF CONFERENCE 

I earnestly and sincerely express my gratitude to the Lord for 
this conference. Like all the conferences that I have attended during 
the past fifty-two years, it is the best we have ever had. I have heard 
that expression regarding all the general conferences of the Church ; 
and the only way that I can account for it is that we are hungry, and 
the same bread and butter tastes a little better when we have an ap- 
petite than it does otherwise although it is the same material. We 
have indeed been blessed of the Lord, and I am grateful for his bless- 
ing. 

I am thankful beyond my ability to express myself for the 
opportunity we had last Sunday morning at 12 :30 to broadcast a mes- 
sage to the people of the world. 

DELIGHTED WITH THE SINGING AT CONFERENCE 

I wish to endorse all that has been said in regard to the singing 
to which we have listened during this conference. We were charmed 
and delighted with the singing by the choir from Manti, and by the 
Singing. Mothers, as also by the Tabernacle Choir. 

An anthem, "O, Great is the Depth," was sung by the Choir. 
Elder Charles R. Jones, President of the Arizona Temple, pro- 
nounced the benediction. 

Conference adjourned for six months. 

The singing at the Friday sessions of the Conference was by the 
Relief Society Singing Mothers, under the direction of Charlotte O. 
Sackett ; at the two sessions on Saturday by the Manti Choir, under the 
direction of Ellis E. Johnson; and at the Sunday sessions by 'the Taber- 
nacle Choir, under the direction of Anthony C. Lund. 

Accompaniments and interludes on the great organ were played by 
Frank Asper and Wade N. Stephens. 

Stenographic notes of the Conference were taken by Frank W. 
Otterstrom and Joseph Anderson. 

Joseph Anderson, 

Clerk of the Conference.

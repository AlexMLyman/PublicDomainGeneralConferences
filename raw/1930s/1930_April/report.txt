CA c Uhrillin& Story of 

CENTURY ONE OF 
CHURCH HISTORY 

mERE is a new story of "Mormoniam," told with a com- 
pleteness and charm that will thrill Latter-day Saints 
with a pride of achievement and at the same time win 
the admiration of the critic, be he friend or foe. In a COM- 
PREHENSIVE HISTORY OF THE CHURCH, B. H. Roberts 
has done a masterful piece of research and has set down the 
record of Century One — 1830 to 1930 — in a brilliant appraisal of 
momentous events. The reader with a sentimental interest will 
be fascinated with this narrative of truth stranger than fiction; 
the reader who approaches the new work with the critical vision 
of the historian will find it fair in statement, authentic in fact, 
copious in detail and sound in judgment. 

A COMPREHENSIVE HISTORY OF THE CHURCH was writ- 
ten by Elder Roberts at the instance of the First Presidency of 
the Church, with a commission to make it exhaustively complete, 
from the remotest beginnings to the close of the Centennial 
Conference of April 6, 1930. The final volume ends with an 
account of the Conference itself, making the history technically 
inclusive of all that happened in Century One of the organized 
existence of the Church. Thus it is a fitting commemoration of 
one hundred years of struggle and achievement. 

This monumental work is not to be confused with any former 
history, journal or chronicle. Though its nucleus is the history 
of "Mormonism" published a few years ago in AMERICANA, 
running serially for six years through that magazine, yet this 
History is NEW — new in its wealth of material, new in method 
of treatment and new in its physical representation of the book 
maker's art.

the celebration of this notable occasion, (including the presentation

MORNING MEETING 

In accordance with instructions previously issued by the First 
Presidency of the Church, the following program was carried out in 
all the wards and branches of the Church, commencing at 10:00 a. m., 
Sunday, April 6th, except in such wards and branches where arrange- 
ments had been made for the people to assemble in their local chapels 
and listen, by means of radio equipment, to the services as they were 
broadcast from the Tabernacle in Salt Lake City : 

"We thank thee, O God, for a prophet." (By choir and congre- 
gation.) 

Opening prayer. 

"An angel from on high." (Duet and chorus.) 

Address of the First Presidency. (A copy of this address had been 
sent in advance to each ward and branch in the Church, and was read 
by one of the elders. This same message was read by President Grant 
at the meeting in the Tabernacle, Salt Lake City, at this same hour.) 

"The Spirit of God like a fire is burning." (By choir and con- 
gregation.) 

One or two brief addresses.

The first session of the Conference was held at 10 o'clock Sunday 
morning, April 6th, 1930. 

The attendance at the meeting in the Tabernacle was limited 
largely to officers of priesthood quorums : the Aaronic priesthood mem- 
bers being seated in one group, and the Melchizedek priesthood being 
divided into groups of high priests, seventies, and elders. The building 
was crowded to capacity, every seat being taken, and the aisles and 
doorways and every other available space occupied. 

For the benefit of those who could not be accommodated in the 
Tabernacle, loud speakers were installed in the Assembly Hall and 
Barratt Hall and on the Tabernacle grounds. 

President Heber J. Grant presided.

ference. 

The choir and congregation sang the hymn, "We thank thee, O 
God, for a prophet." 

Elder Hyrum G. Smith, the Presiding Patriarch of the Church, 
offered the invocation. 

"An angel from on high" was sung by Cyril Martin and Id|a 
Hepworth, the choir and congregation joining in the chorus. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

My heart is full of gratitude beyond my power to express as I 
look upon this wonderful audience of the priesthood of the living God, 
together with officers of our organizations, assembled here in conference 
in commemoration of the one hundredth anniversary of the organization 
of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 

I am about to read to you an address by the First Presidency of 
the Church, copies of which have been sent to all wards, stakes and 
missions in all countries where we have organizations of the Church. 
At this hour all over the world this message will be read to our people. 

THE FIRST PRESIDENCY OF THE CHURCH OF JESUS 
CHRIST OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS TO OUR BELOVED 
BRETHREN AND SISTERS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD: 

On this, the one hundredth anniversary of the organization of the 
Church, we salute you, and pray that the blessing of God our Father, 
and the grace and love of Jesus Christ, our Lord, may abide with you 
forever. 

We preface our message to you by reference to the following 
scripture : 

"Behold, I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God. I am the life and the light of 
the world. I am the light which shineth in darkness, and the darkness compre- 
hendeth it not." 

As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so was the 
Son of God lifted up, that whosoever believeth in him shall not perish, 
but have eternal life. 

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, through its presi- 
dency, reaffirms the truths set forth in the above scripture, and calls 
upon its members in all parts of the world to rededicate their lives to 
the service of the Master and the establishment of his kingdom upon 
earth. 

From the beginning of time, as we count it, to the present, 
God our Father has, at divers times, both by his own voice and the voice 
of his inspired prophets, declared that he would send to earth his only 
begotten Son, that through him, by means of the resurrection, of which 
our Lord was the first fruits, mankind might be redeemed from the

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



penalty of death, to which all flesh is heir and by obedience to the law 
of righteous living, which he taught and exemplified in his life, be 
cleansed from personal sin and made heirs to the Kingdom of Heaven. 

In songs of praise the Psalmist declared his coming. In ecstasy 
the prophet Isaiah looked forward to the day when he would manifest 
himself among men, and, by foreknowledge which came from the 
Father, announced the details of his death and the dire consequences of 
his crucifixion. 

The Redeemer himself declared, notwithstanding the apparent 
failure of his mission and ministry as it applied to the generation to 
which he brought the message of salvation, that at a period of time 
then in the remote future, a period designated as the latter-days, the 
Dispensation of the Fulness of Times, he would again reveal himself, 
would re-establish his Church upon earth, and come to reign in 
triumph and majesty over his people. 

In humility, and with full consciousness of the responsibility in- 
volved, we bear witness to the people of the world that with the 
appearance of the Father and the Son to the Prophet Joseph Smith, in 
the early spring of 1820, the greatest gospel dispensation of all time was 
ushered in, a dispensation of light, radiating from the presence of God, 
illuminating the minds of men, increasing intelligence and knowledge, 
which is the glory of God, and by the application of which the past one 
hundred years have been made the Miracle Century of the ages. 

The increase of scientific knowledge, invention, industrial develop- 
ment; the harnessing of the forces of the universe and adapting them 
to the comfort and convenience of man, have reached a degree of per- 
fection not dreamed of by people who lived when the past century was 
ushered in. 

In 1830 Abraham Lincoln attained his majority. He was still 
pursuing his studies by the light of a tallow dip, or pine knot, because 
there was nothing better to be had ; and it was under these circumstances 
that he prepared himself to become the foremost citizen of his country, 
thirty years later. 

Since that time our system of education has undergone a miraculous 
change. The log or little brick school-house of a century ago has 
been supplanted by temples of learning, in which our children enjoy 
conveniences and comforts that the wealth of kingdoms could not, at 
that time, have provided. They have maps of the world before them, 
books treating all known subjects, teachers better informed upon the 
subjects taught, heat provided; and when they require light they touch 
a button and the electric current does the rest. 

Agriculture, the foundation upon which the very existence of the. 
human race is builded, was still in a primitive condition. Men har- 
vested with a, scythe or sickle the grain which grew in their fields, and 
threshed it with a flail. 

A man now sits upon a machine, and at one operation, reaps, 
threshes and sacks ten acres of grain, with less fatigue than he formerly 
harvested one.

Women carded and spun the wool and wove the cloth with which 
they and their children were clothed. 

The cards, spinning wheel, and loom have passed. They are now 
to be seen only as heirlooms or sacredly cherished souvenirs. 

Possibly no other human agency has greater influence upon civili- 
zation and the development of the people of the world than that which 
provides quick ( and easy transportation of people and things from place 
to place. By it individuals, communities, and nations come to know each 
other better, exchange of commodities is made possible, and the com- 
merce of the world is maintained. 

For this purpose roads made by men thread the world. We travel 
over them now on bands of steel, in luxurious motor cars, in floating 
palaces, or through the air. 

Only yesterday these roads were mere trails, blazed by fearless, 
intrepid men, through unknown forests, over snow-clad mountains, 
across trackless deserts or uncharted seas. 

In fulfilment of the words uttered by inspired prophets, thousands 
of years ago, the wooden boats in which we sailed the seas at the 
beginning of the past century have been supplanted by floating palaces 
of steel, in which we ride the waves or navigate the ocean's depths in 
safety. 

For silver the Lord has given us gold, which has become the basis 
of exchange throughout the civilized world ; while iron takes the place 
of wood and stone in construction. 

By the application of scientific methods, which have been revealed 
during the past century, the profession of medicine and surgery has 
brought to the people of the world relief from the most dreaded diseases, 
which devastated communities and at times threatened the very existence 
of mankind. 

Undoubtedly the greatest miracle of the century is the accomplish- 
ment by which the human voice, with the personality of the speaker, 
may be indefinitely preserved and reproduced with every detail of 
originality. 

Whether uttered in the frozen arctics, or from the jungles of the 
tropics, without visible means of conduct, the human voice instantly 
circles the earth, thus overcoming the hitherto insurmountable barrier 
of both time and space. 

Contemplating these accomplishments of the past century, to which 
but brief reference has been made, we are led to exclaim : 

Great and marvelous are thy ways, O Lord 
From eternity to eternity Thou art the same ! 
Thy purposes fail not, neither are there any 
who can stay Thy hand ! 

THE CHURCH 

The Annunciation. As the glory of the Lord shone round about 
shepherds, who kept watch over their flocks by night upon the hills of 
Judea, and the angel of the Lord announced to them that there had 



6 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



been born that day, in the city of David, a Savior, who was Christ 
the Lord, the light of the Christian Dispensation burst forth upon the 
world. 

"And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host 
praising God, and saying, 

"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men." 

The heavens were illuminated by the glory of the Lord, the 
heavenly host shouted hosannas as the Babe of Bethlehem, the Son of 
God, the Only Begotten of the Father in the flesh, he who was to 
become the Savior of mankind, was born into the world. 

From the time of his birth to the day of his crucifixion, Satan, 
that old serpent, the devil, the enemy of all that is good, he who by his 
wiles and deception tempted our first parents and brought death into 
the world, sought the destruction of our Lord. 

Kings persecuted him, because they knew and feared his power. 
The learned and wealthy spurned him, because of his humble birth; 
while the ignorant, not understanding, left him in derision. 

The personal ministry of Jesus was of short duration. But thirty- 
three years elapsed from the time of his birth to the day of his cruci- 
fixion, and but a small portion of this time was devoted to his ministry. 
From the time of the delivery of his great sermon on the Mount, but 
three years elapsed until his death. 

During the brief period of his ministry he effected the organization 
of his Church, selected twelve apostles, upon whom, with Peter at their 
head, he conferred the keys of the priesthood, and to whom he made 
plain the organization of his Church and the doctrines of his Gospel, 
by obedience to which mankind may be redeemed and brought back 
into the presence of God. This accomplished, he declared his mortal 
mission completed, and went to his death with the sublime prayer 
upon his lips that his Father would pardon those who were responsible 
for his crucifixion. In their ignorance they knew not what they had 
done. 

THE FIRST CENTURY OF THE PRIMITIVE CHURCH 

During the first century of the Christian Era', Octavius, Caligula, 
Nero, Vespacian and his son Titus, all of whom were bitter persecutors 
of the Church, occupied the throne of Rome. 

Pagan Rome had become the mistress of the world. From the 
time of the crucifixion of Jesus, persecution of the Christians had been 
merciless and wicked beyond expression. During the reign of Caligula 
and Nero, who were more brute than human, Christian men were slain 
without mercy, while their wives and daughters were carried away to 
Rome, to be sold to the highest bidder, or distributed to a depraved 
soldiery. 

Men, women, and children were cast into the great amphitheater at 
Rome, to be torn by wild beasts or fight for their lives, for the enter- 
tainment of these inhuman monsters. Christians, their bodies covered

with combustibles, were made to stand upon the walls, to be burned, in 
order that light might be provided for the spectacle below. 

To deprive Christians of life was not sufficient. Every cruel means 
of torture that the human mind could suggest, which might add to the 
suffering of the victim, was applied. 

The falling away which had been predicted by the prophets had 
come. The man of sin, the son of perdition, was revealed, who opposes 
and exalts himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped ; 
so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, showing himself that 
he is God. (2nd Thessalonians 2:3-4). 

Thus centuries passed, centuries during which darkness covered 
the earth and gross darkness the minds of the people, centuries during 
which Satan, in an orgy of Pagan idolatry, ruled the world. 

A NEW GOSPEL DISPENSATION 

The opening of a new gospel dispensation was not a thing of 
chance. Jesus Christ, through his messenger, had declared to John 
while he was upon the isle of Patmos, that an angel would come flying 
through the midst of the heavens, having the everlasting Gospel to preach 
to them that dwell upon the earth, calling them back to the worship 
of God who is the Maker of the heavens and the earth, the sea and the 
fountains of water. The Redeemer himself had declared that before 
the time of his glorious appearance, to assume his rightful place among 
his people, the Gospel of his kingdom should be preached in all the 
world, for a witness unto all nations, before the coming of the end. 

As the time of the restoration of the Gospel was clearly indicated, 
so was the gathering place of those who would accept the truth definitely 
declared. The prophet Isaiah had said that it should come to pass in 
the last days, that the mountain of the Lord's house would be established 
in the top of the mountains, and be exalted above the hills, and that 
people from all nations would flow unto it. Many people, he declared, 
would go and say : "Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of 
the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob." For what purpose? That 
they might be taught the way of the Lord, and learn to walk in his paths. 

At the time of the calling of Abraham, the Lord entered into 
covenants with him and his posterity, in which he promised that Pales- 
tine should be theirs for an everlasting heritage. This promise was 
repeated to Isaac, and confirmed upon the head of Jacob. 

Prior to his death our father Jacob called his twelve sons to him, 
blessed them, and defined the future of their posterity, adding little 
to that which had before been promised, until he laid his hands upon 
the head of Joseph and not only conferred upon him the blessing and 
heritage of his fathers, but also declared that his heritage prevailed 
above that of his progenitors, unto the utmost bounds of the Everlasting 
Hills, to a land choice above all other lands, a land rich in the blessings 
of the earth, of the heavens above, and the sea beneath. 

Upon Ephraim, the younger of the two sons born to Joseph during 
his sojourn in Egypt, he sealed the heirship to the blessings and 
promises conferred upon his father.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



While Satan held the world in spiritual darkness, by means of 
priestcraft and idolatry, he shackled the masses with the chains of 
kingcraft, and thus held the world in both spiritual and civil bondage. 

As the time of the end drew nearer, God's Spirit descended upon 
men, impelling them to break the shackles of idolatry and priestcraft 
with which they were bound. 

When John Wycliffe, John Huss, and William Tyndale, (all of 
whom suffered martyrdom for their faith) Martin Luther and others, 
gave the Holy Scriptures to the people of the world, and in the strength 
of Israel's God declared the truth, the beginning of the end had come. 

When the people of Great Britain wrung from King John the 
Magna Charta, when Oliver Cromwell later cut off the head of King 
Charles the First, and the Covenanters of Scotland took up arms against 
the then dominant church, the morning star of hope arose, heralding 
the sunshine of a brighter day. 

The coming of Columbus to America had been foretold centuries 
before he sailed from the port of Palos, in Spain. The Spirit of the 
Lord was upon him, was his guide and protector in his great adventure, 
and led him to the shores of a new world. 

It was not by chance that the Puritans left their native land and 
sailed away to the shores of New England, and that others followed 
later. They were the advance guard of the army of the Lord, pre- 
destined to establish the God-given system of government under which 
we live, and to make of America, which is the land of ^Joseph, the 
gathering place of Ephraim, an asylum for the oppressed of all nations, 
and prepare the way for the restoration of the Gospel of Christ and 
the reestablishment of his Church upon earth. It was under these 
circumstances and others of which the Lord was the author, that the 
stage was set for the raising of the curtain upon the opening scene of 
the Dispensation of the Fulness of Times. 

As the Christian Dispensation was ushered in, the glory of the 
Lord shone round about the shepherds who kept watch over their 
flocks by night upon the hills of Judea, while the voice of the angel of 
the Lord declared the Babe of Bethlehem to be the Savior of the world. 

So also the glory of the Lord overshadowed Joseph Smith, and 
God himself, in the glory and majesty of his person, with his Only 
Begotten Son, Jehovah, revealed himself in vision, and with his own 
voice designated Joseph Smith to be the instrument through whom the 
greatest gospel dispensation of the ages was to be ushered in. 

There was nothing of ostentation, pageantry or dramatic display; 
it was a simple, solemn occasion, superlatively glorious and impressive 
beyond expression. 

The voice of the Lord, which had been silent for ages, was heard 
again. Again that divine message, so oft repeated, was delivered: 
"This is my Beloved Son. Hear him !" The personality of the Father 
and his Only Begotten Son was again revealed that mankind may know 
them as they are. 

Of his first vision Joseph Smith says: 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT

"After I had retired to the place where I had previously designed to go, 
having looked around me and finding myself alone, I kneeled down and began to 
offer up the desires of my heart to God. I had scarcely done so when immediately 
I was seized upon by some power which entirely overcame me, and had such an 
astonishing influence over me as to bind my tongue so that I could not speak. 
Thick darkness gathered around me, and it seemed to me for a time that I was 
doomed to sudden destruction. 

"But, exerting all my power to call upon God to deliver me out of the power 
of this enemy which had seized upon me, and at the very moment when I was 
ready to sink into despair and abandon myself to destruction — not to an imaginary 
ruin, but to the power of some actual being from the unseen world, who had 
such marvelous power as I had never before felt in any being — just at this 
moment of great alarm, I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head, above 
the brightness of the sun, which descended gradually until it fell upon me. 

"It no sooner appeared than I found myself delivered from the enemy which 
held me bound. When the light rested upon me I saw two personages, whose 
brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air. One of 
them spake unto me, calling me by name, and said, pointing to the other — 
This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him !" 

(When the Apostle Paul appeared before King Agrippa and Festus, 
the Roman Procurator, he declared that Jesus Christ, who had been 
crucified upon Calvary, was risen from the dead ; that he lived and had 
appeared to him in a cloud of light, calling him to be his messenger 
to the Gentiles. Festus, in amazement, cried out: "Paul, thou art 
beside thyself ; much learning doth make thee mad." But Paul replied — 
"I am not mad, most noble Festus, but speak forth the words of truth 
and soberness." 

In like manner Joseph Smith, an obscure country boy, fifteen years 
of age, when he related to certain sectarian ministers of the neighbor- 
hood that he had received a heavenly vision, was made the victim of 
ridicule and bitter persecution. 

Men flew into passion as they declared that it was all from the 
devil, that there were no such things as visions and revelations in these 
days ; that all such things had ceased with the Apostles, and that there 
would never be any more of them. 

Satan again manifested his power and determination to frustrate the 
will of Christ, that he might maintain his dominion over the world and 
continue to hold captive the souls of men. From that hour he raged 
in the hearts of the wicked, until he finally encompassed the death of 
the Prophet; not, however, until he had accomplished the work which 
the Lord had sent him into the world to do. 

Like Paul, Joseph Smith, during the three years intervening after 
his vision, steadfastly maintained that in vision he had seen the Father 
and the Son, and had heard the voice of the Lord. 

On the evening of September 21, 1823, he had retired as usual 
to his bed room for the night, a night fraught with events of which 
he had not dreamed, events of supreme importance to him and to the 
people of the world. He says : 

"While I was thus in the act of calling upon God I discovered a light 
appearing in my room, which continued to increase until the room was lighter 
than at noonday, when immediately a personage appeared at my bedside, standing 
in the air, for his feet did not touch the floor.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



"He had on a loose robe of most exquisite whiteness, it was a whiteness 
beyond anything earthly I had ever seen ; nor do I believe that any earthly thing 
could be made to appear so exceedingly white and brilliant. His hands were 
naked, and his arms also, a little above the wrists ; so, also, were his feet naked, 
as were his legs, a little above the ankles. His head and neck were also bare. 
I could discover that he had no other clothing on but this robe, as it was open, 
so that I could see into his bosom. 

"Not only was his robe exceedingly white, but his whole person was 
glorious beyond description, and his countenance truly like lightning. The room 
was exceedingly light, but not so very bright as immediately around his person. 
When I first looked upon him I was afraid ; but the fear soon left me. 

"He called me by name, and said that he was a messenger sent from the 
presence of God to me, and that his name was Moroni; that God had a work 
for me to do; and that my name should be had for good and evil among all 
nations, kindreds, and tongues, or that it should be both good and evil spoken 
of among all people." 

This messenger revealed to Joseph Smith that there was a book 
deposited, written upon gold plates, giving an account of the ancient 
inhabitants of America and the source from whence they came, and 
that the plates would later be delivered into his hands to be translated 
and published to the world. 

On the twenty- third day of September, 1827, the plates containing 
the record of the Book of Mormon were delivered to Joseph Smith who, 
by the gift and power of God, translated the characters which were 
engraven upon them. 

The Book of Mormon does not in any degree conflict with or take 
the place of the Holy Bible, but is the strongest corroborative evidence 
in existence of the divine origin of that sacred record. It has been 
before the world for more than a century, during which time no 
statement contained in it, whether it refers to the civil history or the 
religion of the people who kept the record, has been proved to be untrue. 

As the translation of the characters engraven upon the plates on 
which the Nephite record was kept proceeded Joseph Smith discovered 
that the doctrine of baptism was taught and practised by the Nephite 
people. Desiring to better understand this principle he did as he had 
done before, went with Oliver Cowdery, his scribe, into the woods, and 
engaged in earnest prayer. The following is quoted from his own 
words : 

"While we were thus employed, praying and calling upon the Lord, a 
messenger from heaven descended in a cloud of light, and having laid his hands 
upon us he ordained us, saying : 

" 'Upon you my fellow servants, in the name of Messiah, I confer the 
Priesthood of Aaron, which holds the keys of the ministering of angels, and of 
the gospel of repentance, and of baptism by immersion for the remission of sins ; 
and this shall never be taken again from the earth, until the sons of Levi do offer 
again an offering unto the Lord in righteousness.' 

"The messenger who visited us on this occasion and conferred this priesthood 
upon us, said his name was John, the same that is called John the Baptist in the 
New Testament, and that he acted under the direction of Peter, James, and 
John, who held the keys of the priesthood of Melchizedek, which priesthood, 
he said, would in due time be conferred upon us." 

With this ordination, and the restoration of the Melchizedek

Priesthood which was later conferred as promised, the fulness of the 
keys and authority of the Priesthood of Almighty God, which had for 
centuries been lost to mankind, was restored and has remained with the 
Church in unbroken succession until the present time. 

With the restoration of the priesthood the way was open for the 
preaching of the Gospel, the administration of the ordinances pertaining 
thereto, and the organization of the Church. 

On the sixth day of April, one hundred years ago today, Joseph 
Smith, with five others who had accepted the message of the restored 
Gospel, met" at the home of Peter Whitmer, Sr., at Fayette, Seneca 
County, New York. The sacrament of bread and wine was administered 
and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints organized. 

In his sermon on the Mount the Master declares that a tree is 
known by the fruit which it produces. We do not gather grapes from 
thorns nor figs from thistles. A bitter fountain cannot bring forth good 
water, nor does a good fountain bring forth bitter water. By this un- 
changeable law we ask the world to judge the accomplishments of the 
Church during the past century. 

It was after his resurrection that the Master commissioned his 
disciples to go into all the world and preach the Gospel to all people, 
baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the 
Holy Ghost. 

In like manner have the disciples of Christ in the present dispensa- 
tion, his Apostles, High Priests, Seventies, (who are his especially 
chosen ministry) and the Elders of the Church, carried the glad tidings 
of the restored Gospel to every part of the civilized world during the 
century past, and wherever the message has been proclaimed there have 
been honest souls who have accepted it and gathered to Zion, in ful- 
filment of the words of the ancient prophets. 

The mountain of the Lord's house has been established in the top 
of the mountains, and people from all nations have flowed unto it. 
Through the blessings of the Lord upon their labors the desert has been 
subdued and made to blossom as the rose. Solitary places have been 
made glad because of them. Cities have been established, springs of 
water have broken out which have given life to the thirsty land, music, 
and the voices of children are heard in the streets where desolation and 
silence had reigned for ages. 

Temples have been erected in which the work of redemption has 
been done for an innumerable host of the living and the dead. 

Many thousands have been brought from the poverty and distress 
of the old world to this blessed land of Joseph, to become wealthy and 
be made happy as they have participated in the blessings which the 
Lord our God has pronounced upon it. 

Looking backward to the organization of the Church, which oc- 
curred under the most humble and, to the world, obscure circumstances, 
and following its history through persecution, poverty, and distress, can 
it be denied that a great and marvelous work has been accomplished, 
that the promises of the Lord have been fulfilled, and his power to ac- 
complish that to which he sets his hand to do, manifested?

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Let glory and honor be ascribed unto God our Father, through 
Jesus Christ, his Son, forever, for he is the author of it all. 

WHAT OF THE FUTURE 

The future, as outlined in the predictions of the ancient prophets 
and confirmed by modern revelation, is pregnant with hope for the 
Church. 

Jesus Christ our Lord said: 

"Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets : I am not 
come to destroy, but to fulfil. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth 
pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled." 

With the present momentum with which the people of the world 
are moving forward in the determination of truth in every field of 
human endeavor, the outlook for the future passes beyond the vision 
of human comprehension. 

Jesus Christ, referring to the time when he would manifest himself 
in the latter days, declared that whereas he manifested himself to his 
own people in the meridian of time and they rejected him, in the latter 
days he would come first to the Gentiles, and then to the house of 
Israel. He says: 

"When the time of the Gentiles is come in, a light shall break forth among 
them that sit in darkness, and it shall be the fulness of my gospel. But they 
receive it not; for they perceive not the light, and they turn their hearts from me 
because of the precepts of men. And in that generation shall the times of the 
Gentiles be fulfilled." 

"At that time, saith the Lord, I will remember the covenant which I have 
made with my people who are of the house of Israel, and will send my gospel 
to them." 

"And it shall come to pass that I will establish my people, O house of 
Israel, and I will remember the covenant which I have made with my people, 
and I have covenanted with them that I would gather them together, in mine own 
due time, that I would give unto them again the land of their fathers for their 
inheritance, which is the land of Jerusalem, which is the promised land unto 
them forever, saith the Father. 

"And behold, this people (the Nephites) will I establish in this land, 
(America) and it shall be a new Jerusalem. And the powers of heaven shall 
be in the midst of this people; yea, even I will be in the midst of you. And 
then shall be brought to pass that which is written : 

"Awake, awake again and put on thy strength, O Zion ; put on thy beautiful 
garments, O Jerusalem, the Holy City. For thenceforth there shall no more 
come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean : For thus saith the Lord : 
Ye have sold yourselves for naught, and ye shall be redeemed without money." 

From the words of the Prophet Daniel we quote the following : 

"In the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which 
shall never be destroyed : and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but 
it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand 
forever." 

John, the beloved disciple of our Lord, says: 

"I saw a new heaven and a new earth ; for the first heaven and the first 
earth were passed away : And I John saw the Holy City, New Jerusalem, 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



13 



coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her 
husband. 

"And I heard a great voice out of heaven, saying: Behold the tabernacle 
of God is with man, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, 
and God Himself shall be with them, and be their God. 

"And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be 
no more death, neither sorrow nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain; 
for the former things are passed away." 

"And the Lord shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people; 
and they shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning 
hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn 
war any more." 

With this glorious vision of the future, to which we look forward, 
we exhort our brethren and 'sisters to put their houses in order, that 
they may be prepared for that which is to come. 

Refrain from evil ; do that which is good. Visit the sick, comfort 
those who are in sorrow, clothe the naked, feed the hungry, care for 
the widow and the fatherless. Observe the laws of health which the 
Lord has revealed, and keep yourselves unspotted from the sins of the 
world. Pay your tithes and offerings, and the Lord will open the 
windows of heaven and pour out blessings until there shall not be room 
to contain them. Be obedient to the laws of God and the civil laws 
of the country in which you reside, and uphold and honor those who 
are chosen to administer them. 

To the people of the world we send our blessing, and bear witness 
to them that God lives, that Jesus Christ is his Only Begotten Son, the 
Redeemer of the world. We call upon all men to come unto him, that 
through his grace they may attain to eternal life and an inheritance with 
him in the kingdom of his Father.

PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 

In spite of my efforts at self-control I have been overcome with 
emotion as I have looked upon the faces of this large congregation of 
men, with a few women, the like of which, so far as we are aware, has 
never before been seen in the history of the world. 

CHANGES WROUGHT IN LAST CENTURY 

Looking backward, as we have all undoubtedly done, contemplating 
the changes which have come to the world since the organization of the 
Church, one hundred years ago, the absorbing thought which has 
come to me is one of gratitude because of the fact that it has been my 
destiny, with you, my brethren and sisters, to have been a participant 
in its marvelous activities. 

I have gone back over the long and winding road, which the people 
of the world have traveled since we have record of their existence, 



14 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



with its well marked sign-boards which tell us that if we will follow 
them they will lead us back to the presence of God from whence we 
came, but from which we have strayed and gone far afield, until the 
road has brought us to where we are today. 

god's directing hand 

In it all I appear to see the hand of divinity constantly directing, 
and hear the voice of our Father who is in heaven calling us back to 
the straight road, and frequently, unconsciously to them, impressing the 
minds of men, impelling them resistlessly onward to the accomplishment 
of a divine purpose, the redemption of the human family, that they 
may achieve eternal life. 

"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth." Of the 
method by which this was accomplished we have little knowledge; 
we do know, however, that the earth was created, because we find 
ourselves here upon it. 

And, "God created man in his own image, in the image of God 
created he him, male and female created he them." 

And he gave man dominion over the earth, and all that is upon it, 
and commanded him to subdue the earth, and make it fruitful. He made 
plain the fact that this could only be accomplished by effort, by the 
sweat of the brow ; that being endowed with reason man was to think, 
to strive, and thus find out truth and apply it, in order that the earth 
might be brought under subjection to his will. For the intelligence and 
will of man is a part of godliness which the Father has bestowed upon 
all of his children, and will, if properly applied and developed, make 
man like unto his Creator. 

Of the antediluvian people who occupied the earth upon which we 
dwell we know but little. Their history, covering a period of 1,500 years, 
is told in the Bible on a dozen small pages. 

Of the new race of men which descended from Noah, our an- 
cestor, we have more definite information. It is a fact, however, that 
there is much of obscurity and doubt surrounding their early history. 

It is these latter people that I have followed with greater interest, 
because it is to them that we more directly trace our ancestry, and it 
was with them, through Abraham our father, that the Lord entered 
into a new covenant which is now in course of fulfilment. 

According to the best available information the expansion and de- 
velopment of the sons of Noah and their posterity had its beginning 
along the upper reaches of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers, and extended 
south from that point to the plains of Shiner, in Mesopotamia. 

We are told that Ham, the son of Noah, begat Cush who was the 
father of Nimrod, the founder of Babylon, which became the greatest 
city of its time, while Asshur, the son of Shem, established his people 
on the Tigris, and built the city of Nineveh. 

Egypt was occupied by the descendants of Ham, through Pharaoh, 
the son of Egyptus, who was the daughter of Ham. 

Assyria, the Asshur of the Hebrews, of which Nineveh was the 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 



15 



principal city ; Chaldea, of which Babylon was the capitol ; and Egypt, 
among the earliest nations of which we have record, are all closely as- 
sociated with the Israelitish people, each having exercised a powerful 
influence upon their character and history. 

It was from Chaldea that the Lord called Abraham, and entered 
into covenant with him in which he promised that he would make of 
him a people, by comparison as numerous as the stars of heaven, or 
the grains of sand upon the seashore. Abraham was at the time a child- 
less man, one hundred years of age. 

COVENANT WITH ABRAHAM 

To properly comprehend the occurrences of the past century one 
must be familiar with the covenant entered into by the Lord with Abra- 
ham and the history of the Israelitish people from that time until the 
present. The Lord declared that covenant to be eternal, everlasting, 
which means that it would not end until the promises made had been 
realized. In part the covenant declared that through Abraham and his 
seed all nations of the world should be blessed. 

It is through the descendants of Abraham that the Holy Bible has 
come down to us, the book which has done more to civilize and stabil- 
ize the world than all others which have been published. It has given 
to us the fundamentals of our system of government and the laws under 
which its affairs are administered. From the family of Abraham the 
Lord has raised up his ancient and modern prophets, and most important 
of all, Jesus Christ, his Only Begotten Son, through whom redemption 
from death and salvation in the kingdom of our Father is made possible 
to mankind. What have we that is of indispensable value to humanity 
which has not come to us through the Israelitish race? 

During the past weeks I have been thinking of these things and 
associating them with the secular history of the world. By this method 
alone am I able to reach satisfactory conclusions regarding the contents 
and meaning of the scripture, and my studies justify the statement 
which I now make : In Abraham and his seed all nations of the earth 
have been blessed. 

With the birth of Jacob the Israelitish race had its real beginning. 
Jacob who was first called Israel ; Jacob who was the father of twelve 
sons, and to whom the promises made to his grandfather, Abraham, 
were reconfirmed, and greatly enlarged. In order that I may be properly 
understood, permit me to make this brief observation : 

THE HISTORY OF THE CHOSEN RACE 

It has become common usage to associate the word Israel with the 
Jewish people only, which is a great error. While it is true that all 
Jewish people are Israelites, it is equally true that there are Israelitish 
people that are not Jews. 

Judah, with whom the tribe of Benjamin united, was but one 
of the twelve tribes at the time when ten of these tribes revolted during 
the reign of Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, and under Jeroboam, the 



16 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



son of Nebat, established an independent kingdom, with their capital 
city at Samaria, in northern Palestine. 

I have gone with Jacob and his sons into Egypt, been with them in 
their prosperity in the land of Goshen, while Egypt was under control 
of the Hyksos, or Shepherd Kings, their own kinsmen, and in their 
distress and servitude after the native princes of Egypt came down 
the Nile, defeated and drove out the Hyksos, and repossessed their 
native land. 

I have followed them in their exodus from Egypt under the great 
prophet Moses, and in their forty years sojourn in the wilderness. I 
have been with them in the conquest of the promised land, in their 
final ascendancy to a great kingdom under David, and rejoiced with 
them during the peaceful reign of King Solomon, when Israel realized 
her golden age. 

In sorrow I have seen the return of this chosen people from the 
worship of the God of their fathers to the worship of idols, which 
brought dissolution and final subjugation by surrounding nations. I 
have seen the Ten Tribes carried away captive by the Assyrians, while 
Judah suffered the same fate at the hands of the Babylonians, and 
was later scattered by pagan Rome to the four corners of the earth. 

To one who does not understand it may appear that the promise 
made by the Lord had failed. Israel had possessed the promised land 
as he had said that they should, but through transgression had lost their 
heritage to other nations, notwithstanding the fact that the Lord had 
declared that heritage to be eternal. 

Has the promise made to Abraham failed? Are the Ten Tribes 
of Israel lost to the world forever ? Is Judah to be forever a wanderer 
without a country which he can call his own? Emphatically, no. 

"Hear the word of the Lord, O ye nations, and declare it in the isles afar 

off, and say, He that scattered Israel will gather him, and keep him, as a 
shepherd does his flock. 

"For thus sayeth the Lord : Behold I will bring them from the north 
country, and gather them from the coast of the earth, and with them the blind 
and the lame, the woman with child, and her that travaileth with child together : 
a great company shall return thither. 

"They shall come with weeping, and with supplications will I lead them. * * 
For I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim is my first born." 

Thus has the Lord spoken through his chosen prophets, and his 
word will not fail. 

Centuries before, while the Israelitish people were still in possession 
of the promised land, the Lord through his prophets had predicted their 
downfall, that they would be scattered among all nations, but would 
ultimately be gathered and restored to their promised heritage. The time 
for the realization of this latter promise is near at hand. 

Babylon, at the time of the Jewish captivity, was referred to by 
Daniel the prophet as having dominion over all the earth. Nebuchad- 
nezzar its king was called the King of Kings. The kingdom was 
thought to be so strong that it would never be overthrown. The Lord, 
however, had long before decreed its fall, and his prophets had declared 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IV INS 



17 



that Babylon should become as Sodom and Gomorrah and that it should 
never be rebuilt or inhabited again. 

The opening scene of the great drama which was to bring to pass 
the redemption of the house of Israel occurred when the Medo- 
Persian army, under Cyrus, effected the conquest of Babylonia, during 
the reign of Belshazzar, the son of Nebuchadnezzar, and established the 
powerful Medo-Persian kingdom in its stead. 

I have been with Alexander of Macedon as he crossed the Hellespont 
from Greece, and with his comparatively small army fought the battles 
of Granicus, Issus and Arbela where he utterly destroyed the great 
Medo-Persian army which Darius had collected, and established himself 
as master of Asia from the Mediterranean sea to the mouth of the 
Nile, a country fifty times larger in area and population than his own. 

I have been with the Roman legions as they swept through Asia, 
destroying the smaller kingdoms which Alexander had set up, and in 
their campaign in northern Europe, which made them masters of the 
then known world. 

I have been with Mark Anthony and Octavius at Actium, where 
they struggled for the mastery of Rome, and have seen that mighty 
empire crumble and fall. 

These have all been turning points in the affairs of the world, which 
have entirely changed what might otherwise have been its history. It 
was not the will of the Lord that despotic rule should be permanently 
established and maintained upon the earth. This was proven in modern 
times when Napoleon met his Waterloo, and in our own day when 
ambition prompted a crowned head in Europe to seek the establishment 
of world dominion. 

In all of this I have seen the finger of the Lord pointing to a time 
when: The God of heaven will set up a kingdom which shall never 
be destroyed, or given to other people, but will stand forever ; when he 
will establish peace upon earth and good will among men ; when nation 
shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war 
any more. 

A CHOICE LAND 

Oh, my beloved brethren and sisters, I beseech you to study the word 
of the Lord, as it is contained in holy writ. You will then know 
that the present is inextricably associated with the remote past to which 
I have referred as it is to the future which is before us. You will 
know that you have been given a land which is choice above all others. 
You will discover that the ancient prophets saw this land of America, 
and declared its destiny. You will know the conditions upon which our 
nation is to be perpetuated, or, on the other hand, because of our lack 
of faith in God, take its place among those mighty nations to which I 
have referred and pass into oblivion. 

Where much is given much is required. This is the land of 
Joseph, it is the land of Zion, a land choice above all other lands. The 
Lord our God has decreed that whatsoever nation shall inhabit it shall 



18 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



be free from bondage, free from all other nations, if they will but 
serve the God of the land, which is Jesus Christ. These are not my 
words, but the words of the Lord, our God. They are binding upon us, 
as they have been binding upon other great nations which have occupied 
the American continent in times past. They imply more than a tacit or 
perfunctory profession of faith in Christ our Lord. We are to render 
service to him. 

TRUE SERVICE 

When asked what the word service implied the Redeemer answered : 
"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart. Thou shalt do 
no murder. Thou shalt not commit adultery. Thou shalt not steal. 
Thou shalt not bear false witness. Honor thy father and thy mother, 
and love thy neighbor as thyself." Simple requirements embodying the 
fundamentals of perfect Christian life. 

If we love the Lord it will be a pleasure to serve him. We could 
not, if we love him, be guilty of murder. The fact that murder is of 
almost daily occurrence is evidence that this great commandment is 
not properly observed. Next to murder the Lord has declared that 
the contamination of the fountains of life through the promiscuous 
intercourse of sexes is an abomination in his sight. 

STANDARDS OF THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS 

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints stands irrevocably 
committed to the observance of sexual purity. It recognizes no double 
standard of morality. It demands the same standard of virtue from 
its men that it does from its women members, and recognizes no circum- 
stance or condition which justifies sexual association except in virtuous 
and legal wedlock. This the Church recognizes to be not only approved 
of the Lord but in direct compliance with his command. 

KEEPING THE LAWS OF GOD AND OF COUNTRY 
"Thou shalt not steal." 

Any person who knowingly deprives another of that which right- 
fully belongs to him, without giving value received for it, is guilty of 
theft, no matter what the process may be by which the transaction is 
made. 

"Thou shalt not bear false witness." 

The frequency with which this commandment is disregarded by 
men and women who appear in our courts under oath to tell the truth, is 
evidence of needed reform. 

If we would only put into practice these simple requirements, and 
we could do so if we would, what a glorious place this world of ours 
would be in which to live. 

You may ask — Why call attention to these conditions while you 
provide no remedy for them ? The remedy is simple, and can be made 
effective. 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 



19 



Paraphrasing the words of Abraham Lincoln : Let every member 
of the Church, from its president, its priest or pastor, to the humblest 
member, and every citizen of the United States of America, from the 
highest elective or appointive officer, to the humblest citizen, here and 
now highly resolve that the faith in God manifested by our fathers, 
who bequeathed to us the priceless heritage of liberty which we now 
enjoy in this chosen land, shall not perish from the earth, but endure 
forever. This done we are secure, without it we have no guarantee. 

I am not prophesying evil of my country. I love it. I love its 
people, and believe in them. I do not believe that they will carelessly sur- 
render the God-given principles of liberty and justice bequeathed to them 
into the hands of aliens who would trample them under foot, and 
turn back the wheels of human progress to the dark ages, from the 
ignorance and bigotry of which we have been rescued by the hand of 
the God of our fathers. 

I know that there are those who will not agree with me in my 
conclusions. Neither have they believed the words of those who have 
taught these things in the past. 

MORONI'S WORDS APPLICABLE NOW 

When the Lord commanded Moroni to write the things which are 
contained in the Book of Mormon, which is the sacred record -of the 
hand-dealings of the Lord with the Nephite people, Moroni said : 

"Lord, the Gentiles will mock at these things." 

The reply was: 

"Fools mock, but they shall mourn, and my grace is sufficient for the meek, 
that they shall take no advantage of your weakness." 

I can think of no words of conclusion more appropriate than the 
words of this chosen prophet of the Lord : 

"And now I speak unto all the ends of the earth — that if the day cometh that 
the power and gifts of God shall be done away among you, it shall be because 
of unbelief. 

"And wo be unto the children of men if this shall be the case. * * * 
"And I exhort you to remember these things ; for the time speedily cometh 
that ye shall know that I lie not, for ye shall see me at the bar of God, and 
the Lord will say unto you : Did I not declare my words unto you, which were 
written by this man, like as one crying from the dead, yea, as one speaking 
out of the dust? * * * 

"And again I would exhort you that ye would come unto Christ, and lay 
hold upon every good gift, and touch not the evil gift, nor the unclean thing." 

These last words of Moroni I commend to you for your consider- 
ation, my brethren and sisters. 

BLESSINGS UPON ALL WHO SEEK RIGHTEOUSNESS 

May the blessings of the Lord be upon you. May his protecting 
hand be over you, and the guidance of the Holy Spirit direct you and 
abide with you and all who seek to establish righteousness and justice 
upon the earth; that God's ikingdom may be established and his will 



20 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



be done on earth as it is in heaven. This is my humble prayer, any 
brethren and sisters, in your behalf and in behalf of all the world. 
Amen. 

The choir rendered the anthem, "Hosanna ! Hallelujah !" words 
and music written by Evan Stephens for this occasion : 



Hosanna, Hallelujah ! 
With heart and voice uniting, 
Hosanna, hallelujah, 
In joyous accord, 
We sing to the Lord, 
Hosanna, hallelujah, 
We sing to the Lord. 
Hosanna, Hallelujah, Amen. 

Sing, O ye ransom'd, 

Ye ransom'd of the Lord, 

Ye who the Gospel received and kept his word, 

Yea, ye pure in heart rejoice, 

Ye who know the Shepherd's voice. 

Sing, O sing ye with joyful heart and voice. 

Sing ye with gladness, 

With gladness and rejoice. 



President Grant announced that he would present to the congrega- 
tion the General Authorities of the Church, and that they would be 
voted upon by the various orders of the priesthood separately and also 
by the entire assembly. 

The President then read the list of General Authorities as follows:

The order of voting was by groups as follows : 
First — The First Presidency. 

Second — The Council of the Twelve and the Presiding Patriarch. 

Third — The First Council of Seventy. 

Fourth — The Presiding Bishopric. 

Fifth— High Priests. 

Sixth — Seventies. 

Seventh — Elders. 

Eighth — Aaronic Priesthood (Priests, Teachers and Deacons). 
Ninth — -The entire assembly. 

As each group arose, in response to the request of President Grant, 
they were asked by him : "Do you sustain the General Authorities of 
the Church whose names have just been read, in the positions mentioned? 
If so, raise your right hands." In each instance, following the response, 
an opportunity was given for any who cared to vote in the negative 
to do so. 

The voting throughout was unanimous in the affirmative. 



Immediately following the sustaining of the General Authorities, 
the entire assembly arose to their feet, and under the leadership of 
President Heber J. Grant, gave the Hosanna Shout, waving their 
handkerchiefs while doing so. 

The words of the Shout are as follows : 

Hosanna ! Hosanna ! Hosanna ! 
To God and the Lamb 
Amen, amen, and amen. 



22 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Hosanna ! Hosanna ! Hosanna ! 
To God and the Lamb 
Amen, amen, and amen. 

Hosanna ! Hosanna ! Hosanna ! 
To God and the Lamb 
Amen, amen, and amen. 

The waving of the white handkerchiefs in almost perfect unison 
and the shouting of praises to God and the Lamb by the thousands 
of people assembled in the great tabernacle, was perhaps the most 
thrilling and impressive religious solemnity that those present had ever 
witnessed. 

The congregation then arose and sang the first and last verses 
of "America." 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

We have received many telegrams of congratulation on this oc- 
casion, but we shall not attempt to read any of them this morning. 

PREDECESSORS GREAT AND GOOD MEN 

It has fallen to my lot, although a very weak, humble instrument in 
the hands of the Lord, to succeed the wonderful men who have presided 
over this Church — the Prophet Joseph Smith, than whom no greater 
man I believe has ever graced the earth; that marvelous pioneer, Brig- 
ham Young ; that mighty champion of liberty, John Taylor ; that 
exceptional converter of men to the Gospel of Jesus Christ, Wilford 
Woodruff; Lorenzo Snow, an extraordinary man at eighty-five years 
of age, who in three years lifted the Church from the slough of 
despond financially to a place of financial standing; and that man, 
beloved by all who knew him, one of the outstanding men of all the 
world, Joseph F. Smith, the greatest preacher of righteousness I have ' 
ever known. 

BLESSINGS PRONOUNCED UPON GENERAL AUTHORITIES 

It is my right and privilege as the President of this Church to 
extend a blessing to the people, and with all my heart and soul I bless 
my counselors for their devotion to me and to the Church. I remember 
with gratitude my counselors who have passed away. I rejoice in the 
wonderful labors and the devotion of each and every one of the men 
who are members of the Council of the Twelve Apostles, also the 
Presiding Patriarch of the Church. I pray God to bless them for their 
integrity and their devotion, for their labors at home and abroad among 
the people. 

I pray God to bless the Seven Presidents of the Seventy, the men 
who stand at the head of that great body of priesthood, whose duty 
and obligation it is to carry the Gospel to the ends of the earth. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



23 



I pray the blessings of the Lord upon the Presiding Bishopric of 
the Church, who preside over all the Lesser Priesthood — the Priests, 
Teachers and Deacons of the Church. 

BLESSES BRETHREN OF PRIESTHOOD 

I pray. God to bless this wonderful gathering of High Priests, 
such a gathering as I am sure cannot be found in any other part 
of the wide world. I pray God to bless the Seventies, and the Elders. 
I pray that he may bless all the members of the Lesser Priesthood; 
that he may richly pour out his blessing upon them in their youth, that 
there may be planted in their hearts a love of God and a desire to 
serve him as they grow to manhood ; that they may feel to walk in the 
footsteps of their faithful parents. All of us who have been born in the 
Church, almost without exception, have been born of parents who have 
given their lives and the best that is in them for the work of God. 

One of the most earnest prayers of my heart all my life has been 
that I should be able to live to be worthy of such a father and such 
a mother as were given to me. 

I pray that the blessings of the Lord may attend all of the general 
officers of our Church, all of whom are devoted to this work. 

GRATITUDE FOR RELIEF SOCIETY ORGANIZATION 

I pray for the blessings of the Lord upon the officers and the 
General Board of the Relief Society. My heart goes out in gratitude 
and thanksgiving to God for the organization, through the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, of that wonderful society. 

I thank the Lord for my association with Eliza R. Snowf Zina 
D. Young, Sarah M. Kimball, Aunt Emmeline B. Wells, Bathsheba 
W. Smith, Clarissa S. Williams and Sister Robison, who have stood 
as officers of the Relief Society. I am thankful indeed for what they 
have accomplished, for their wonderful work and example, and I 
pray God's choicest blessings upon them. 

DEVOTION AND SACRIFICE OF THE MOTHERS 

It is our sisters who carry the burden of the work. We talk 
about the missionary work of the Elders who go forth to proclaim the 
Gospel; we talk about the great pioneer work of the early settlers of 
this country, but I wish to say here that it is the mothers at home who 
are making the sacrifice for the boys to go into the mission field. It 
is the mothers who stand the hardships far more than the men. Men 
are engaged in many activities, and without the devotion and absolute 
testimony of the living God in the hearts of our mothers this Church 
would die. May God bless the mothers of men, is my most humble 
prayer; and I do bless them in the name of God our Heavenly Father 
and in the name of Jesus Christ, our Redeemer. 

INVOKES BLESSINGS UPON AUXILIARY WORKERS 

I pray for the same blessing upon the officers of the General 



* 



24 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Board of the Young Ladies' Mutual Improvement Association, and 
upon the Primary Association, the Sunday Schools and the Young 
Men's Mutual Improvement Association. I also pray for the blessings 
of the Lord upon those devoted workers in the Genealogical Society. 
It is wonderful what is being accomplished in the temples through the 
energy of these people who are working along that line. 

BLESSINGS INVOKED UPON THE CHOIRS 

I pray for the blessings of the Lord upon our choir and its officers, 
and upon the music committee. I pray for the blessings of the Lord 
upon the choirs throughout the Church. There are no other people 
in the world in proportion to their numbers who have so many who pray 
to the Lord in beautiful songs. 

PRESIDENTS OF MISSIONS ACCOMPLISHING MARVELOUS WORK 

God bless the Presidents of Missions, one and all. They are 
marvelous men, those who are active today and those who have served 
in the past. It is pleasing to contemplate the love and the confidence 
they have inspired and the inspiration that they have given to those over 
whom they preside. 

PRESIDENCIES OF STAKES AND BISHOPRICS OF WARDS 

I pray God to bless the wonderful men who have given so much of 
their time as Presidencies of the Stakes of Zion. Many of the men 
occupying these positions give nearly as much time to their Church work 
as they do to their ordinary affairs in life. 

I pray for that same blessing upon the wonderful men who are 
Bishops and Bishops' Counselors. I ask for the blessing of the Lord 
upon those who preside over the quorums of priesthood throughout 
the Church. 

THE MISIONARIES AND THEIR ACCOMPLISHMENTS 

I pray for the blessings of the Lord to be abundantly with those 
who have been sent forth to proclaim the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, 
to lift up their voices in testimony that God lives, that Jesus is the 
Christ, the Redeemer of the world, the Savior of mankind, and to bear 
witness that Joseph Smith was a prophet of the true and the living 
God, inspired of God to restore again to the earth the plan of life and 
salvation. 

Oh, how my heart goes out to those young men and young women 
who go forth with this testimony burning in their very hearts for the 
spread of the truth. And I thank God that they have brought honest 
souls from all over the wide world, from every denomination under 
heaven, to the Gospel of Jesus Christ. May God bless them and bless 
their parents who are making sacrifices to send them forth to proclaim 
the Gospel. Oh, how I do rejoice that I do not know of one son or 
one daughter in all Israel who has gone out into the world to proclaim 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



25 



the truth, that has come home to announce the truth is in some 
other land. Thank God for the truth and the power that goes with 
these young men and young women as they go forth to proclaim the 
restoration again to the earth of the plan of life and salvation, the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ that you and I have received. 

PRAYER FOR AND APPRECIATION OF PATRIARCHS 

God bless the Patriarchs. I thank the Lord for Patriarch Perkins, 
a noble man in St. George, who gave me a patriarchal blessing as a 
little child, foretelling my life in one small page of longhand writing, 
which has been fulfilled to the very letter. I thank God for John 
Rowberry, who gave me a blessing to the effect that I should be taken 
from Tooele and be made one of the leading officials of this Church; 
and who promised Francis M . Lyman that his name should be chronicled 
among the Apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ in these last days. God 
bless our Patriarchs and inspire them in their splendid work. 

A PRAYER FOR THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 

I echo the prayer that was offered in the opening of this meeting, 
that God will bless the President of the United States and his cabinet, 
and all the officers of our great country. How I do rejoice in that 
'statement contained in the Book of Mormon to the effect that this is 
a land choice above all other lands and that no king shall reign here. 
Let us be true and loyal to this land of liberty. In no land in all the 
wide world could the Gospel of Jesus Christ have been established 
except in this beloved America of ours. 

BLESSES GREAT BRITAIN AND OTHER NATIONS 

God bless that liberty-loving country, Great Britain. May he bless 
Canada, our neighbor on the north, which is like one of our own family. 
May the blessings of the Lord attend our people on the south, in 
Mexico, who are struggling for their rights and their liberty. May 
peace dwell in that land. 

BLESSINGS INVOKED UPON HONEST-HEARTED EVERYWHERE 

I pray that the blessings of Almighty God may be and abide with 
all the members of this Church, every faithful, diligent Latter-day 
Saint. May we be able to preach the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ 
by the honesty, the uprightness and the truthfulness of our lives. If we 
do this, then we are sure of a final triumph. 

I rejoice in all that we have heard here today. I rejoice and I 
am sure that the Prophet and the Patriarch of the living God who 
sealed their testimonies with their blood will rejoice at this wonderful 
gathering. Oh, how I did pray, how I did supplicate the Lord, that 
Joseph F. Smith, the son of the martyred Patriarch, might live to 
occupy today this position that I am occupying. Never until the 
night before he passed away did I give up the hope that he should 



26 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



have that privilege. But it has fallen to my lot without my seeking 
to occupy this position. By that spirit of blessing which he possessed, 
I bless you one and all, and all Israel, and every honest-hearted soul 
in all the world who is trying to do good, and I do it in the name 
of the Lord Jesus Christ, the Redeemer of the world, and by the 
authority of the living God, the priesthood that I hold. Amen. 

The choir rendered the "Hallelujah Chorus" from the oratorio 
"The Messiah." 

Elder Joseph R. Shepherd, President of the Logan Temple, offered 
the closing prayer, and the Conference adjourned until 2:00 p. m. 



AFTERNOON MEETING 

Conference was resumed at 2 o'clock with President Grant pre- 
siding. 

The music for this meeting was furnished by the Salt Lake 
Tabernacle Choir, under the leadership of Prof. Anthony C. Lund. 

The choir and congregation sang the hymn, "Praise to the man 
who communed with Jehovah." 

Elder Edward J. Wood, President of the Alberta Temple, offered 
the opening prayer. 

The hymn, "The Spirit of God like a fire is burning," was then 
sung by the choir and congregation. 

PRESIDENT CHARLES W. NIBLEY 

In looking over this vast congregation, composed largely of the 
priesthood of the Church, — this greatest of all gatherings — my soul is 
subdued and I feel my own weakness, my own inability. Nevertheless, 
I am proud indeed to be numbered among you, a member of the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I feel it a distinct honor to be 
able to assist in some small degree in the furtherance of this great work. 

THE SIXTH DAY OF APRIL 

I would like to call your attention (I think Brother Wood mentioned 
it in his prayer) to this beautiful Sabbath day, this sixth day of April, 
nineteen hundred and thirty. Where would you go in all the world to 
find a more perfect day than this? The Lord, by his overruling provi- 
dence, has given it to us, and all thanks and honor and praise be given 
to him. 

A wonderful day, the sixth day of April! Many notable things 
have occurred on it. The organization of the Church for one great 
and notable thing. The Prophet Joseph recites in his own story that 
it was early in the spring of 1820, one hundred and ten years ago, when 
he went into the woods to pray. I like to think of that also as being on 
the sixth day of April. We have no definite knowledge of it, but I 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. NIBLEY 27 



believe it in my heart and in my soul. And while I have no warrant in 
revelation for so stating, I believe with all my heart and soul that the 
sixth day of April was the birthday of the Lord Jesus Christ, our Savior 
and Redeemer. Certain it is that the New Testament tells us that the 
shepherds were tending their flocks on the hills /of Judea when the 
glory of the Lord fell upon them. More likely was it in the spring of 
the year than on the twenty-fifth day of December, which is celebrated 
as the birthday of the Savior ; yet we go on celebrating that day, and it 
is all right to do so, inasmuch as that is the day the world generally ac- 
cepts. But I repeat it is my individual opinion, firmly fixed in my mind, 
that the sixth day of April is the birthday of the Savior of the world. 
I further like to believe that the resurrection of the Redeemer, which 
marked his triumph over death and the grave, also occurred 'on the 
sixth day of April, though I have no definite proof. 

Another notable event that occurred on this day is part of the his- 
tory of this glorious country of ours — the United States of America. 
The Lord says in the revelations given through the Prophet Joseph 
Smith that he raised up wise men for the very purpose of framing the 
Constitution, which guarantees liberty to all. It was born on the sixth 
day of April. It had previously been adopted by the Constitutional 
Convention and submitted to the various States for ratification. While 
it was intended that the returns should all be in by the fourth of March, 
it was not until the sixth day of April that the electoral votes of the 
different States were counted by the Senate and House then in session. 
And on the sixth day of April George Washington was declared to be the 
President of the United States. So the nation had its real birth at that 
time. 

Another thing that happened on the sixth day of April: Our 
nation, in 1917, declared war on Germany, and with all its heart and 
soul it went into that war. What for? To fight for liberty, to fight 
against the principle of force, which is Satan's principle, which prin- 
ciple is championed wherever Satan rules. This nation in a short time, 
with two million men overseas, and with two million more under arms 
in training, helped to settle the matter; and thus victory was achieved 
through the action of our government, which government has always 
stood for liberty and for the blessing of mankind. 

I say again that it is my individual opinion — we have no revela- 
tion for it — that the Prophet Joseph Smith received his first manifesta- 
tion on the sixth day of April. : It was the greatest vision ever given to 
mortal man ; for both the Father and the Son plainly manifested them- 
selves before his eyes and spoke to him. I believe that that was on the 
sixth day of April, and I believe, although I have no warrant in revela- 
tion for it, that the sixth day of April is the birthday of our Lord and 
Savior Jesus Christ. 

THE MOST OUTSTANDING ACCOMPLISHMENT 

Now, looking back over the one hundred years that have passed, I 
have tried in my mind to think what is the most outstanding work that 
has been accomplished, Of course we as Latter-day Saints know that 



28 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



the spiritual force, the power of the priesthood that is with this work 
and in this work, is greater than the temporal. But men who have not 
been touched with the power of the Holy Ghost, cannot see the king- 
dom of .God. Like Nicodemus they cannot comprehend it. They have 
not taken advantage of the means of entering it. But temporal things 
they can see and understand ; and to my way of thinking, the great out- 
standing, beneficent, splendid work that has been accomplished by this 
Church in the last one hundred years has been the gathering of the 
poor, not the rich, for we have had scarcely any rich among us. One 
in a hundred was possibly well-to-do when gathered, but I should say 
not more than that. The poor have had the Gospel preached to them, 
and the poor have been gathered to Zion. Gathered to Kirtland, Ohio, 
in the first place ; gathered to Missouri ; then driven from Missouri, 
after which the gathering place was at .Nauvoo, Illinois, from 1839 
until 1845 and 1846. The gathering in from the States of this Union 
and from nearby countries to the places I have mentioned occupied 
from fourteen to sixteen years. The balance of the one hundred years 
that have passed and which we are commemorating, have been spent 
by the saints here in the valleys of the mountains. And this gathering 
has gone on all through that period, even up to the present time. 

How has this been accomplished? It has been accomplished by 
the Church, the power of this Church, the influence of this Church, by 
the people of this Church, the poor helping the poor to get here to this 
land of Zion, consecrated and dedicated for the gathering place. For 
did not Isaiah say that in the last days the mountain of the Lord's 
house should be established in the top of the mountains, and that all 
nations should flow unto it ? This has been truly a wonderful work. 

THE PERPETUAL EMIGRATION FUND 

In the early days of our settlement here the Perpetual Emigration 
Fund was established, and many were helped here through that fund. 
And let me say in passing that the widows and the orphans were not 
forgotten. President Brigham Young said we would dedicate our lives 
to see that every poor faithful saint, — widows, orphans and all — was 
gathered to Zion. That work has gone on until tens of thousands and 
their succeeding generations, amounting now to hundreds of thousands, 
have been aided and helped. 

It would interest you if you were to go into the books of the Per- 
petual Emigration Fund and see some of the names of families who 
were beneficiaries of that Fund ; rather distinguished, now perhaps, but 
very poor then — so poor that they had to be helped by that Fund, and 
yet they are now some of the richest among our people. Some of their 
children unfortunately have forgotten. It is a bad thing to forget. It 
is a good thing to remember what the Lord has done for us. And the 
Lord accomplished that work, and this is the Zion of the Lord to which 
they came. 

TO BUILD UP ZION 

I recall, away back in 1869, when I went on my first mission, we 



PRESIDENT CHARLES IV. NIB LEY 29 



met over in the old Seventies' Hall. President Young instructed us in 
these words : "Now when you Elders get out in the world and see. con- 
ditions there and think of the good things we have here at home, you 
may get to praising our country too much. Don't do that. This is 
what I would like you to promise the people who gather to Zion : plenty 
of hard work and persecution." 

So there was no allurement or inducement to come for better cir- 
cumstances, but only to build up Zion. And this has been Zion all the 
while. Isaiah said concerning it : 

"For the Lord shall comfort Zion : he will comfort all her 'waste places ; 
and he will make her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of 
the Lord ; joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving and the voice 
of melody." 

The Lord was to do this. To whom? To Zion. Do you know 
of any other people called Zion upon the face of the earth? Do you 
know of anything more beautiful than this verse of Isaiah's? I am 
going to take the liberty of reading it again : 

"For the Lord shall comfort Zion : he will comfort all her waste places." 

HER WASTE PLACES COMFORTED 

Were there waste places here when our pioneers came ? Was there 
anything here but waste and desert and wilderness? There were no 
paths. Go around in other countries where there is food for wild game 
and you will find trails — -for jack-rabbits at least. You will find a trail 
for the deer, you will find tracks. There was not anything of the kind 
here. For it was so much of a waste and so much of a wilderness and 
desert, and so barren, that there was scarcely any game except way back 
in the mountains. It was in very deed a trackless waste, a wilderness. 
There were no streets, no paths, no trails, no anything, — just a' desert. 
Yet the prophet of the Lord a few days after arriving here, putting 
down his cane right on this block, prophesied, "Here we will build the 
temple of the Lord." 

"For the Lord shall comfort Zion : he will comfort all her waste places ; 
and he will make her wilderness like Eden, and her deserts like the garden of 
the Lord; joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving and 'the voice 
of melody." 

Is the voice of melody here today? Is there any place in the world 
where there are sweeter singers and more of them in proportion to the 
population than right here? Is there any more of thanksgiving and 
the voice of melody anywhere else in the world according to numbers, 
than there is here in this land? This is Zion. The Lord will comfort 
Zion and all her waste places, and he will make her wilderness like 
Eden and her desert like the garden of the Lord. 

Another verse by the same Isaiah and with respect to the same 
Zion : 

"And the ransomed' of the Lord shall return, and come to Zion' with songs 
and everlasting joy upon their heads; they shall obtain joy and gladness, and 
sorrow and sighing shall flee away." 



30 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



This is the word of the Lord concerning Zion. This is the Zion 
of our Lord. 

THE LORD HAS DONE IT 

Time will not permit me to speak further in respect to this one 
great outstanding, wonderful work that the Lord has accomplished 
with Zion — the gathering of the saints from all parts of the earth. He 
has brought it about. He has overruled it. It is he that hath made us, 
and not we ourselves. Do not forget that. The sacrifices that our 
parents have made have been most wonderful. The Lord was with 
them. My heart sorrows when I think of my own parents, the poverty 
and sacrifice that they had to undergo in so many different ways ; and 
I glory in the fact that they failed not nor faltered, but stood firm 
through it all. They gave of their lives for my sake, so that the path 
is easier for me, and I am blessed more in living and trying to live to 
help on in that great work. All praise be unto the Lord for his good- 
ness and mercy and blessings. 

BLESSINGS THROUGH OBEDIENCE AND SACRIFICE 

I praise the Lord for the association of my brethren, for the priv- 
ilege of meeting with the saints, for the enjoyment I have in laboring 
for this great cause. I know it is the work of God. I know that Joseph 
Smith was a prophet of God. I know that this people will be blessed 
far more than they ever have been blessed, far more than they could 
hope to be blessed, if we will only, as our President has said, keep the 
commandments of the Lord, pay our tithes, and sacrifice something for 
the kingdom of God. It is sacrifice that brings forth the blessings of 
heaven, let me tell you, and the man or woman who is not willing to 
make some sacrifice cannot claim the blessings. 

May the Lord help us build up his kingdom, glorify his holy name, 
and remember that in this great hundred years past what a wonderful 
work of gathering to Zion has been accomplished. Such a beneficent, 
blessed piece of constructive work, the greatest contribution to tens of 
thousands of the poor that have been so thoroughly blessed by it, must 
be recognized by all men, and acknowledged as a good work. Amen. 

PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAWSON 

My brethren and sisters : This is an historic occasion. In view 
of the great celebration of the centenary of the Church now in progress, 
my thoughts of late have turned to the prophecies of old. Many of 
the predictions of the ancient prophets have been fulfilled to the letter 
so far as time has gone, others are in process of fulfilment. 

I am reminded of a very remarkable incident that occurred in the 
very early years of the earth's history. This incident has been briefly 
referred to by my brethren who have already spoken, but I have been 
looking at it from a little different angle. 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. NIBLEY 31 



NEBUCHADNEZZAR DREAMS A DREAM 

It would seem that Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, dreamed 
a dream which made a profound impression upon his mind, but strange 
to say, upon awakening, he was unable to recall the dream, and the 
interpretation thereof. So he called for the wise men of Babylon, the 
magicians, the astrologers, the sorcerers and the Chaldeans, and he com- 
manded them to bring back his dream and give the interpretation 
thereof. If they would do this he promised them gifts and rewards. 
But if they failed he warned them that they would be cut to pieces 
and destroyed. 

They said to him, "O king, live forever : tell thy servants the dream, 
and we will shew thee the interpretation." 

The king said, "The thing is gone from me." 

AN UNUSUAL REQUEST 

Thereupon the wise men were very much agitated, and they said 
to him: 

"O king, thou hast required of us an unusual thing. There is no man upon 
the earth who can show the king this matter. It is only the gods, whose 
dwelling is not with flesh, that can bring back your dream." 

For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and sent forth 
a decree that the wise men of Babylon should be destroyed. 

This was a very critical time for Daniel, the young Hebrew prophet, 
and his three brethren who were numbered among the wise men of. 
Babylon. Daniel sought an interview with the king and plead with 
him for further time, saying that he would get the interpretation of 
his dream. His request was granted. 

THE KING'S DREAM MADE KNOWN 

Now, mark you, by the prayer of faith the king's dream was made 
known to Daniel of the Lord, and the interpretation was given. Once 
more Daniel was conducted before the king and he said to him : 

"We will bring back your dream, O king, and we will give you the interpre- 
tation thereof." 

And so he said: 

"Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This great image, whose 
brightness was excellent, stood before thee, and the form thereof was terrible. 

"This image's head was of fine gold, his breast and his arms of silver, 
his belly and his thighs of brass, 

"His legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay." 

And then, the prophet said : 

"Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote 
the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and brake them to pieces. 

"Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to 
pieces together and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors ; and 
the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them : and the stone 
that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth. 



32 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



"This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before 
the king." 

THE INTERPRETATION 

He said : 

"Thou, O king, art a king of kings : for the God of heaven hath given 
thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory. 

"And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field, and 
the fowls of the heaven, hath he given into thine hand, and hath made thee ruler 
over them all. Thou art this head of gold. 

"And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and another 
third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth. 

"And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron." 

This fourth kingdom was represented by the feet and toes of iron 
and of clay. 

"Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain 
without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the 
silver, and the gold ; the great God hath made known to the king what shall 
come to pass hereafter : and the dream is certain, and the interpretation 
thereof sure." 

And he said further: 

"And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom 
which shall never be destroyed : and the kingdom shall not be left to other 
people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it 
shall stand forever." 

THE FULFILMENT 

The Christian world of today is witness of the fact that the very 
things which the great image stood for have occurred so far as time 
has gone. History certifies to the fact that King Nebuchadnezzar was 
the head of gold. The Medes arid Persians, an inferior kingdom to 
Babylon, were the arms and breast of silver. The Macedonian king- 
dom, under Alexander the Great, was the belly and thighs of brass ; 
and the Roman kingdom under the Caesars was the legs of iron. For 
mark you, later on the kingdom, or empire of Rome, was divided. 
The head of the government in one division was at Rome and the head 
of the government in the other division was at Constantinople. So 
these two great divisions represented the legs of iron. Finally, the 
Roman empire was broken up into smaller kingdoms, represented by the 
feet and toes of iron and clay, and as there were ten toes on the image 
we might well conclude that the following ten kingdoms stand to repre- 
sent the toes : Italy, established in 496 A. D. ; France, in 753 ; England, 
853; Germany, 806; Holland, 922; Portugal, 1138; Persia, 1139; 
Austria-Hungary, 1159; Spain, 1171; Greece, 1829 A. D. 

THE STONE CUT OUT OF THE MOUNTAIN 

The stone cut out of the mountain without hands, representing 
the kingdom of God, was established April 6th, 1830, with six members, 
and is known as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Thus 



PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAWSON 



33 



the work of the Lord in our own time, designated by revelation as a 
marvelous work and a wonder, had a very humble beginning, but it 
has grown apace. Today the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints has a membership of about 700,000. It cost the best blood of 
the nineteenth century to establish this work on the earth. Its founder, 
the Prophet Joseph Smith, and his brother Hyrum Smith, the Patriarch, 
were martyred for the cause of truth, in Carthage, Illinois, in 1844. 
The Latter-day Saints have passed through the fire of persecution and 
have stood the test of one hundred years. Never was the prospect 
brighter for our people than it is today. We sincerely believe, and, 
I may say, have every assurance, that this Church will stand forever. 
It is indeed the Church of the Son of God, the Redeemer of mankind. 

ITS ORGANIZATION 

Within its organization will be found a line of general authorities, 
consisting of a First Presidency of three, a council of Twelve Apostles, 
a Presiding Patriarch, a First Council of Seventy and a Presiding 
Bishopric. There are in the Church also numerous quorums of High 
Priests, Seventies, Elders, Priests, Teachers, and Deacons, by which 
and through which the affairs of the Church are conducted and the 
Gospel preached to the saints and to the world and the ordinances of 
the Gospel administered for the salvation of souls. 

For the knowledge I have and of which I humbly testify that 
Jesus is the Christ, and that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God, I am 
truly thankful and feel to praise the Lord. 

God bless you, my brethren and sisters. God bless the people of 
the Latter-day Saints, and prosper his work, and bless those who preside 
over and direct the affairs of his Church is my prayer, in the name of 
the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

An original dramatic poem, written especially for this occasion, 
will now be read by its author, Elder Orson F. Whitney. 

Elder Whitney then took the stand and read the poem, which 
follows : 

THE LIFTED' ENSIGN— A CALL TO ISRAEL 

"And he shall set up an ensign for the nations, and shall assemble the 
outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four 
corners of the earth." — Isaiah 11 :12. 

Characters Impersonated : 
elias :: ephraim :: judah 

elias : 

A voice that crieth in the Wilderness : 

"Make plain and straight the Highway of our God !" 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



One Hundred Years, on Time's swift pinions flown, 
Since raised the Ensign for the Gathering — 
One hundred years, and still the standard waves, 
Summoning the chosen from world-wandering, 
Calling the covenant people from afar, 
To greet the coming of their God and King. 

Children of Jacob, Isaac, Abraham, 
Sheep of the flock the Shepherd comes to fold ! 
How have ye answered to his beckoning call ? 
What have ye done his pathway to prepare ? 

Give answer, Ephraim, from thy mountain height, 
Where streams the signal seen and sung of yore — 
First-born of God in these, Earth's final days, 
Speak thou, and let the winds thy story tell ! 

ephraim : 

I hear thee, and with joy I answer thee: 
'Twas mine to welcome the return of Truth, 
Of old from Error's wide domain withdrawn ; 
Mine to unshroud the buried mystery 
Of mighty nations, whispering from the dust ; 
Mine to unfurl the Ensign, and to sound 
O'er sea and land the tidings wonderful ; 
Flooding the world with truth and righteousness, 
Thrusting the sickle in the golden grain, 
Reaping a ripened field, and garnering 
The earliest sheaves of Israel's harvest home. 

I've toiled and wept and bled to bring once more 

The fulness of Christ's Message unto men ; 

To build redemptive Temples, that the dead, 

Obedient to law in spirit realms, 

Might with the living share in joys divine. 

More wouldst thou hear ? — 

There's more I fain would tell. 

elias : 

Tell on ! — tell on ! Truth wearies not mine ear. 
ephraim : 

Expelled by tyranny from Freedom's ground, 

I tracked the lone untrodden wilderness. 

Here 'neath my virile touch, once barren wilds 

Now sing for joy and bloom delightsomely. 

I've planted Zion's outposts, firm and strong, 

Rock-fortressed by the everlasting hills, 

Where Faith expectantly doth bide the hour 

When Zion's self from Eden's soil shall rise, 

Thrilled by the glad acclaim : "The Bridegroom comes 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY 



Nor all my ministries on Western shores, 

Nor all my sympathies with next of kin. 

Have I not stood on ancient Olivet, 

And offered prayer to heaven for Judah's weal ? 

Have I not combed the universe and drawn 

The choice of nations to this favored land, 

Where homing tribes shall shout to trembling hills, 

And lift hosannas to the listening skies 

That light the towers of New Jerusalem? 

By these and kindred works my faith is shown. 
Thus have I answered to the Shepherd's call. 

elias : 

And answered well. And He whose day now dawn 

Shall crown thy valor with a recompense 

As boundless, endless as eternity. 

Now, Judah, tell thy tale ! 'What deeds of thine 

Are strewn as flowers along Messiah's way? 

judah : 

Messiah ? — Him I see not in the man 

Whom Christians name the Christ, their holy one. 

I see not in their God my fathers' God, 

Whose covenant abides with Abraham ; 

Who spake to Moses in the fiery Mount, 

And gave the Law to govern Israel. 

Blind am I to what Ephraim beholds. 

Perchance the air is purer, view more large, 

On yonder height where stalwartly he stands, 

Than in the misty vale where I respire. 

Thinkst thou I err, his thought interpreting ? 

But I am with him in the war for right, 
For justice and the freedom of the world. 
And to this cause give I a willing hand, 
And pledge my friendship, faith and loyalty. 

elias : 

Thou sayest well — yet well might'st say far more 
For Israel's God, Jehovah, Lord of All, 
Who gave the Gospel as He gave the Law, 
And died that endless death might vanquished be. 
What limit to His merit or His claim? 

judah : 

Plead not with me my ancient faith to change — 
Older than aught by Christians deemed divine ; 
Pure as the snowy peaks of Lebanon, 
That pour reviving streams o'er thirsty plains. 
What nobler doctrine than the Decalogue? 
What higher law than Justice can'st thou name ? 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



elias : 

Is Justice more than Mercy — more than Love ? 
No need to change thy faith, but build thereon. 
If thou the Perfect Law wouldst comprehend, 
Its loftiest, purest, heavenmost height attain, 
Add unto justice the pure love of God — 
Sweet Charity, of graces all the crown. 

judah : 

Justice — not Mercy — is the Jew's demand. 

And tell me, when did Christian charity 

Mean justice for the wronged, down-trodden Jew? 

Mercy, forsooth ! what mercy have they shown, 

Who slaughter 'neath the banner of the Cross? 

Too much we hear of love and charity, 

From lips of hate, from hearts of cruelty, 

Boasting a leader whom they follow not, 

Prating of love, but never practising. 

This Jesus, whom they laud, not emulate, 

Good man — e'en great perchance. But why a God ? 

Joseph and Mary's son, a common Jew, 

Who sat at feet of rabbis famed for lore, 

And learned from them, yet brought forth nothing new. 

Why should the knee of Israel bend to him ? 

elias : 

Sat He at no man's feet for power to save 
And lift up fallen worlds. His wisdom came 
From heights more distant than the unseen stars, 
Fresh as the morning dew upon the flower ; 
Pure as the snow — so white on Lebanon 
Till tainted by the soil through which it flows — 
Truth by tradition's muddy stream unroiled. 

The sapient rabbis, famed for antique lore, 

Might well have learned from Him — but would not learn. 

The wisest of the scribes and pharisees, 

Astounded, routed were, and put to shame 

By One who spake as no man since or ere. 

Old was his doctrine — truth is ever old — 

Old as its parent spring, Eternity, 

Old upon earth, from Adam until now. 

Yet seemed it new to them ; — and this the cause, 

The chief and primal cause of that great crime 

Which on the cross He pardoned and forgave. 

Man — merest man will die a friend to save. 
Who but a God, to save both foe and friend ? 
And very God was He, though human-born, 
Divinely-gotten Child of Deity. 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY 



But why waste words upon those recreant Jews, 
Those pseudo Christians — false that mask as true ? 
The salt can lose its savor — so with them — 
Unworthy parts, bespeaking not the whole. 
Why dwell upon these human happenings? 
Lift thought and argument to higher planes. 

JUDAH : 

Amen ! say I. And now to me make plain — 
To me, who am so dull — this mystery : 
What need had Israel of this Nazarene? 
Why came a Christ, great Moses having come? 
And why a Gospel when the Law was known ? 

ELIAS : 

What need of Christ — the Lord — since Moses came? 

Moses to Christ was but as part to whole, 

Preface to book, mere river to the sea, 

And all the dispensations of the past, 

When heaven hath gladdened earth with spirit showers, 

Are but as streams that to one Ocean flow. 

Why separate the Gospel from the Law — 
Greater and less — container and contained? 
Why part God from his prophet messengers, 
Sent from Above to voice and work his will, 
And preparation make for mightier things 
Than e'er were known among the sons of men ; 
Completing what creation's morn began, 
When Gods in glory launched a universe? 

judah : 

But Abraham — the solemn Covenant — 

Jehovah's sacred promise to His own : 

"In thee and thine all men, all nations blest" — 

Spoken these words upon the idle wind, 

That now they be as though they ne'er had been ? 

elias : 

'Twas Christ made covenant with Abraham, 
Jesus, Jehovah — for the twain are one; — 
Then gave Himself that covenant to fulfill ; 
And mixt His people with earth's alien tribes, 
That all — not Israel only — might be blest, 
Nor least and last of nations fail to share 
In blessings showered through him upon the world, 
Sprinkled, as rain, with his believing blood ; 
Peopling the arid wastes of unbelief 
With souls responsive to the clarion call 
Shaking the seas and isles and continents, 
And gathering what was scattered ages gone. 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



JUDAH : 

But Moses — what of him? Lived he for naught? 
Sayest thou his mighty mission was in vain? 

elias : 

Nay ; but to round his glorious ministry, 
And link the lesser with the greater part, 
Making effectual all that went before, 
In this, the dispensation last of all, 
Came he the Keys of Gathering to restore ; 
Lest Ephraim's rallying" standard wave in vain 
O'er Joseph's land and Zion's, known of old 
By seers and prophets from thy household sprung. 
Whose sacred words flow down the centuries 
To find fulfillment in this ample age, 
Where past and present, sire and son must join, 
Perfection reign, and all in Christ be one. 

Ephraim his part hath played, and thou no less, 
In God's great drama — "Marvel and Wonder" named. 
Wherefore, complete thy story, well begun. 
What hast thou done His pathway to prepare ? 

JUDAH : 

His pathway! — his, the peasant carpenter, 
Whose body, stolen from the tomb, long since 
Hath crumbled and returned to native dust? 
Granting, for argument, he is to come, 
Why should I strew with palms his earthward way? 
Why for his coming should my soul prepare? 

elias : 

Because He is thy Father and thy Friend, 

Because He is the God of Israel — 

Buried yet risen Savior of mankind, 

Author and Giver of the life divine. 

What hast thou done that He on earth may reign ? 

Silent? Then wouldst thou choose one speak for thee, 

Who ne'er unfriendly was to thee or thine, 

But sympathetic in thy sorrows all? 

For thou hast borne the brunt of martyrdom, 

Alike in Christian and in heathen lands, 

Enduring long and suffering patiently, 

While lesser breeds have trampled thee and spurned. 

Driven — despoiled — tortured and trodden down, 

Drinking the bitter cup, Captivity, 

Yet still, through groaning, pain-racked centuries 

Honoring Jehovah's name, Jehovah's law, 

Spreading the knowledge of the living God 

Amid the shrines of Baal and Ashtoreth. 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY 



Why 'twas thy hand the instrument became 
Of purpose heaven-ordained ere earth began, 
Whereby, through sacrifice and death, came Life, 
To rescue and redeem a fallen world, — 
No mortal knoweth. Only this men know: 
Christ did not cast thee off. He that forgave 
Is still thy Friend — as are true Christians all ; 
For none love God who hate what God doth love. 

Forth in these modern days thine eager hand, 

To build anew the old Jerusalem, 

To raise once more her walls, oft leveled down ; 

To gather in thy sons and daughters fair, 

And sow a sterile land with f ruitf ulness ; 

Redeeming thus thine ancient heritage, 

That Zion's King may sit on David's throne. 

Not all thy sons thy wearied arms uphold, 

Not all are Hurs and Aarons in the strife. 

Summon thy worldings from the tinseled show, 

Where folly reigns and ruin works its will. 

Teach them to play a better, nobler part, 

And walk with thee the greater "Great White Way." 

Rouse all that slumber beneath sordid spells, 

Or unto gods of dust low homage pay; 

Bid them to bring their gold and jewels rare, 

Their heaped up stores of precious merchandise, 

Their wealth, like Pelion on Ossa piled, 

And beautify the Holy Place of Him 

Whose law shall yet from Zion's land go forth, 

Whose royal edict from Jerusalem. 

For Israel o'er Amalek must prevail, 

And repossess in full the Promised Land. 

Ah ! Judah, couldst thou see what Ephraim sees — 
Thy monarch in that lowly Nazarene, 
Long-symboled by the oft-slain paschal lamb, 
Prophetic of the Sacrifice Supreme. 

Would thou couldst see what ancient seers discerned, 

What spirit-quickened eyes may now behold — 

Messiah in that Prophet first-of-all, 

The Moses of a mightier Exodus 

Than e'er was dreamt of in rabbinic lore ; 

Deliverer of a captive universe, 

In bondage to the powers of death and hell ! 

And thy Deliverer in a day to come, • 
When hostile legions thunder at thy gates, 
When half thy city hath become a spoil, 
As written in the scroll of prophecy. 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Then shalt thou see and feel His wounded hands, 
Then shalt thou fall and worship at His feet ; 
And all that fight 'gainst Jacob's, Judah's God, 
Shall be as dust and ashes whirl-wind-blown, 
As flying chaff before the hurricane. 

JUDAH : 

What confirmation hath this mighty claim ? 
How can I know if such great things be true? 
If I be blind, who will my sight unscale? 

ELIAS : 

He who makes blind to see and deaf to hear ! — 
Hearken to Him and whomso'er He sends. 
Bow to the sceptre of the Son of God, 
The Gospel of the High and Holy One, 
And by that Gift which maketh manifest 
Thou'lt clearly see and of a surety know 
The message Ephraim brings thee is divine, — 
Old and yet new, the Everlasting Truth, 
• Pure from the presence of our fathers' God. 
Fresh from the fountains of Eternity. 

JUDAH : 

Why Ephraim ? Why his proud pre-eminence, 

Towering amid the tents of Israel? 

Why should his word or thine determine all? 

elias : 

Because it is the word of Israel's God, 

Whose servant I, as I would fain be thine ; — 

The God of Moses and of Abraham, 

The God of patriarchs and prophets all, 

The God of Israel free and Israel chained ; 

God of the humble and the pure-in-heart ; 

God of the just, in every age and clime; 

The Christ of Bethlehem and Calvary, 

The King of Kings, the crucified and crowned. 

Come, weary-laden, He will give thee rest, 

And thou shalt tread the rose-strewn path of peace. 

ephraim : 

Heed, Judah ! heed Messiah's messenger, 
Hearken to me, thy brother and thy friend. 
No more doth envy of thee sour my soul, 
Nor doth thine anger vex me, as of yore. 
Forgiven as I forgive, clean, clear I stand, 
And I am sent Good Tidings to proclaim. 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY 41 



No man-made creed — no dogma vague, unsound — 
The Ancient Faith, pure, simple, sweet, sublime, 
The Gospel in its plentitude of power, 
The Gospel in its fulness — this I bring. 

elias : 

Judah! 'tis Ephraim calls — he loves thee well, 
His hand extends, his heart, to welcome thee. 
Why stand aloof ? Why doubt and hesitate ? 
Jerusalem and Zion are as one. 
See Japheth launch his ships to people them ! 
The Gentile, all unknowingly doth serve 
The cause of Him who summons Israel 
To Joseph's land, to Judah's hills and vales. 
Behold them in their flight from Babel's doom, 
Borne on the shoulders of the Philistine? 

Be not outstript in such a glorious race. 
Judah, arise ! Put on thine ancient might, 
Expand thy soul, enlarge thy sympathy ; 
Join hands with Ephraim, and bring to pass 
All that the prophets and the seers foretold ! 

judah : 

Thy speech I can believe most kindly meant, 
Thy motive pure and generous and just. 
But who can change the course of destiny? 
Who void what Great Jehovah hath decreed ? 
'Tis conscience guides me, and high Heaven alone 
Doth hold, of that mysterious lock, the key. 

Yet something tells me we shall meet again. 
God grant it be as friends ! And so, farewell. 

The choir and congregation sang the hymn, "High on the mountain 
tops." 

ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS 

Of the First Council of Seventy 

My dear brethren and sisters : I am going to read my remarks on 
this occasion in the interest of brevity, but chiefly in order that I may 
know when I am through. I warn you, however, that I read very much 
worse even than I speak. If I do not present all I would like to say 
on this occasion I shall still be very happy, because I am going to ask 
leave "to print" the parts that must be omitted in my verbal remarks. 
In this, too, I shall be happy, because the printed parts of the speech 
are already set up by the printers, and those parts constitute six large 



42 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



volumes, each from five hundred and sixty to six hundred pages per 
volume, making in all over 3,400 pages. That work, with the verbal 
remarks I am now making, will constitute my discourse at this first 
centennial conference of the Church, covering one hundred years of 
organized existence. 

Of course you will surmise by now that I am making reference 
to the Comprehensive History of the Church, Century I, which the 
Presidency of the Church has directed to be published as one of the 
features of this centennial conference ; and which they directed me 
about a year ago to prepare. I can now report that five of those volumes 
are printed and bound, and that the sixth will be printed and bound by 
the middle of April or at farthest by the first of May. 

I would not have you think, however, this history of a hundred 
years has been wholly prepared in the time limit of a year. Its present 
publication is rather the culmination of many years — I might say of 
a life-time of work. Under circumstances quite remarkable — but too 
full of detail to speak of now — an opportunity came to me to write for 
a New York magazine what its publishers called a detailed "History 
of the Mormon Church." To make space for it they changed the 
magazine from a bi-monthly to a monthly periodical ; enlarged its size, 
and at the same time changed its name from "The American Historical 
Magazine" to "Americana." "The History of the Mormon Church," 
as the article prepared was then called, ran through six years of that 
publication, beginning in 1911, and ran at an average of forty-two pages 
per number. After its publication in that form, two years more were 
spent in verifying its numerous references and improving its arrange- 
ment; and now another rather strenuous year has been devoted to its 
final preparation for the press. 

I will ask you to remember that this publication is not mine beyond 
the mere matter of construction. The publication of it both in the 
first instance and now was made possible by action of the Presidency 
of the Church, by President Joseph F. Smith, and now by President 
Heber J. Grant. From first to last the Presidency will have advanced 
for the publication as it now issues from the press at least $100,000; 
and they propose to have it sold at such prices to the people — as I 
understand it — so nearly the cost of producing it, that I am doubtful if 
they will ever recover from the sale of it the money they have advanced 
for its production and reasonable interest upon it. 

Permit me to say that financially this work means nothing to me. 
Its publication and sale will not bring me one dollar for its preparation; 
if it did I should shame to speak of it here as advertising my own wares. 
But this is not so, the work is not mine financially, I could not have 
financed it, neither shall I profit financially by it. My work in con- 
nection with it has been given in the ordinary service of my regular 
work in the Church, prompted and sustained through all the years by 
my deep love of the subject, and my desire to leave on record one 
sermon on the New Dispensation of the Gospel. And I am grateful to 



ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS 



43 



those who have made possible the production of my discourse that 
requires six large full volumes to contain it. In my remarks, then, 
I am just reporting a work which the Church has undertaken and has 
brought to what I venture to think is a successful termination. 

Some may question the need of so voluminous a work. Six vol- 
umes! Why could not the history of a hundred years of the New 
Dispensation have been written in one volume, or at most in two? 
For some purposes that might well be. But I desire to say a word of 
justification for the largeness of this work. 

In the first place you have to deal with an immense subject. You 
have to consider the first century' of the Dispensation of the Fulness 
of Times. That is the dispensation of all dispensations ; the one which 
will gather into itself all the dispensations of God's revealed will through 
all the ages, from the days of, Adam until the present time; the dis- 
pensation when God will "gather together in one all things in Christ, 
both which are in heaven and in earth, even in him" (Eph. i). The 
history of this dispensation then is some contract. In it the ends of 
the earth meet. It comprises in a way, the history of the world and of 
the human race. It will have to deal with all true philosophy and all 
true religion, and the contact of these with false philosophies and false 
religions and the struggle for existence between the two — the false 
and the true. Of course, I have not attempted in my puny six volumes 
to go into the treatment of all this vast field. My work covers merely 
the first century of this New Dispensation ; but even so the work, as 
you see, is necessarily a large one, and needs scope for its treatment ; 
room for the consideration of its mighty themes and the correlation 
of them with past, present and future. So that the very largeness of the 
theme alone would justify and demand a large work. I have found 
the scope of six volumes inconveniently narrow in places for an adequate 
treatment of some phases of the great subject in hand. There are 
other considerations also which justify the employment of so large a 
treatment of the subject besides mere largeness of it. 

A few years ago a critic of some standing in the Christian world — 
he was secretary of a large group of so-called Christian churches — 
conceded that "the Mormon church is possessed of elements of great 
power. These elements are founded in its principles of centralized 
power, and in its social program." He said, "there is no real menace 
in the Mormon Church to our (i. e. United States) political institu- 
tions ;" dangers along that line were past. And then : 

"Mormonism has reached the zenith of its supernatural visions, is receding, 
gradually fading in the Mormon consciousness itself. The time spirit will cure 
it of its abnormalities. It will die amid its own worshippers." 

"The way to oppose Mormonism is not to throw mud upon it. A cam- 
paign of detraction only helps it to grow. The thing to do is to treat it with 
candor and fairness. * * * It must fall of its own, weight, if it is so to 
fall at all." 

Then he treats us to this reflection with its implication : 



44 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



"Our little systems have their day ; 
They have their day, and cease to be; 
They are but broken lights of Thee, 
And thou, O Lord, art more than they." 

This critic is Wm. Oeschger, Secretary of the Nebraska Christian 
churches (State Journal, Nebraska, Nov. 24, 1918). 

At a public meeting in Reading, Penn., a lady submitted the follow- 
ing question to me : 

"In view of the fact that the drift of the world's thought is away from 
acceptance of the miraculous, what is to be the future of Mormonism?" 

The question is a thoughtful one. It is a fact that the trend of 
the world's thought is away from acceptance of the miraculous. It 
is also true that Mormonism had its birth in what men call miracles; 
in such miracles as are said to tax the credulity of the mind of man 
to accept, and of modern man in particular. In view of these premises, 
then, what is to be the future of your faith, Latter-day Saints? The 
future of Mormonism? Is it the case of an inflowing tide that has 
carried a ship far up a gently sloping shore, and that now the tide ebbing, 
leaves the ship beached on the shore, to become a helpless derelict that 
in time must perish ? 

Another suggestion: A recent writer, as late as January, 1930, 
discusses what to him are the necessary limitations of Mormonism. 
Permit me to say that this writer knows his subject, and our protagonists 
will not find it the easiest task in the world to meet all his criticism. 
This writer concedes that of the whole group of religious movements 
in America that arose about the same time that Mormonism had its 
origin, Mormonism alone has survived; that is, in any way worth 
while, and is today a really "going concern." Then he asks, this being 
so, "Why then has not God's kingdom overspread the Republic ?" His 
answer is : "Simply because it is self -limited." And he argues that 
matter of self-limitation of "Mormonism" in this way : 

"The quest for the perfect American religion could be successful only 
on the lowest level of intelligence. Piety and business could only be completely 
fused by means of a creed too ridiculous for any widespread acceptance. * * * 
The doctrines of Mormonism are indispensable to its system." 

The critic is right on that point. "The doctrines of Mormonism 
are indispensable to its system." Mormonism must be wholly accepted 
or wholly rejected. Its doctrines, and the whole-hearted acceptance of 
them is indispensable to membership in its system. The miraculous 
visions of Joseph Smith, the miraculous visitation of Moroni, and the 
miraculous translation of the Book of Mormon, the fact of direct and 
continuous revelation from God, all must be accepted or Mormonism 
can have no standing; nor can anyone have a standing in Mormonism 
without acceptance of these doctrines. Then our author proceeds : 

"If they [meaning the doctrines] are altered or rejected in any particular, 
the system must collapse !" 



ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS 



45 



Nothing. more true was ever said of Mormonism than that; and I 
hope Latter-day Saints appreciate the fact of it. Then our writer 
launches his thunderbolt : 

"And they (the doctrines of Mormonism) compose a body of belief almost 
incredibly absurd. Mormonism made a formidable effort to include all the 
imbecile dreams that were contemporary with its rise. It was and it remains, 
at once, millennial restorationist and perfectionist. Fossilized in its canons is 
nearly every metaphysical, theological and liturgical insanity of the American 
pentecost. It epitomizes the religious nonsense of a full half century. It was 
too fundamentally a reaction, as creeds of restoration must necessarily be, so that 
it retains notions long since discarded by its competitors. A body of beliefs 
as absurd and grotesque may exist on a small scale here and there, in Los 
Angeles or Zion City, but none so grotesque is accepted by any number com- 
parable to the Mormons.," 

And these "absurd" and "grotesque" miraculous doctrines, it is 
argued, will constitute the limitations of Mormonism, and confine its 
acceptance to a few. That is to say, according to this view Mormonism 
may become a tolerated, minor sect, but never will be a world movement 
— God's kingdom, overspreadjng the republic and the world. To recur 
to my Reading, Penn., lady's question — for involved in that, by impli- 
cation, is the same argument and conclusion as in this American Mer- 
cury writer's discussion — "In view of the trend of modern thought 
away from acceptance of the miraculous, what is to be the future of 
Mormonism ?" 

Which is it to be, Latter-day Saints, a limited but tolerated sect, 
or a world movement? A beached ship on the shore — derelict of the 
receding world-thought-tides, or the kingdom of God overspreading 
the nations? What is to be your answer, Oh Church of Latter-day 
Saints, to these criticisms and this prediction based upon your alleged 
self-limitations, which are relied upon as marking your defeat as a 
world movement? 

Again what is to be your answer? My answer is — Your history 
of one hundred years will be your vindication ; will effectively prove 
your claims to the world movement character of your religion and your 
church. Not a sect, but the universal religion founded upon Jesus 
Christ — his Gospel and the New Dispensation of it, the complement and 
fulfilment of all that has gone before, and prophecy of what shall be 
hereafter. To make this appear, however, your historic statement, your 
history must not be merely a recital of events. The events must be 
coordinated and so linked together that the rationale of successive 
events shall be made apparent; and how they link in with the world 
movements which but spell out God's purposes struggling to get ex- 
pressed. All this requires ample space — every word of six volumes! 

Above all, your history must be honest and fearless. Not mere 
eulogy of what may be your own side, and a convenient silence, or a

If it be the duty of the drama and acting to so hold the mirror up to

and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure," still 
more is it the duty of history to so mirror truth and only truth. All 
this that your History may command the respect of mankind. In our 
case the History must be so full and frank and fair that truth and the 
spirit of truth shall be what sunlight is to the atmosphere, so permeating 
it as to be in and through it an everywhere present spirit of truth, as 
the Spirit of God is everywhere preserve through his creations. Such a 
presence that can no more be separated from your History than sun- 
light can be plucked from the atmosphere. Such a statement of, and 
such a treatment of the great truths brought forth in Century One of 
the organized existence of the Church of the New Dispensation ; and 
so related to what must be the grand purposes of an All-wise and 
All-loving and Just and Merciful and Righteous Heavenly Father, that 
the truth will stand vindicated and self-evident to the minds of the 
men of good will by the mere statement of it, largely enough accepted 
to make it the dominant kingdom of truth. Here a doctrine of our 
first prophet, Joseph Smith, helps us : 

"Every word that proceedeth from the mouth of God has such an influence 
over the mind that it is convincing without other testimony. Faith cometh by 
hearing." 

That is to say, Truth has a native power of its own, and if stated 
clearly and fully it will be its own witness. 

"No," said Joseph Smith, so sure was he of this principle — "No, 
I don't want anyone to tell I am a prophet, or attempt to prove my 
word." He was confident of the self-evident truth of the spoken word. 
This being true, our cause shall suffer little from the threat of self- 
limitations, and the menace of unbelief because of our doctrines being 
"absurd" or "grotesque," since the truth of them may be established 
by a clear and effective statement of them ; the truth being its own wit- 
ness. Tell your story, preach your sermon. Write your History in 
the very spirit of truth ; and the spirit of truth will rise up to confirm it ; 
"its own convincing power will be its witness." 

I have so tried to write your history. 

As to whether Mormonism will be merely a tolerated sect, or a 
world movement, the veritable kingdom of God to spread over all 
nations, it but remains for those who are the members of this Church 
which God has founded, who constitute its priesthood and its member- 
ship ; it only remains for them to keep the vision splendid before them 
with which this work began ; and I predict a world movement, not a 
sect will be its character. 

God, who at sundry times and in divers manners made known his 
plans and purposes with reference to man's earth life, such revelations 
being known as dispensations of his Gospel, has in these last days 
made known that these successive dispensations have come through the 
ages as an intermittent stream flows through a valley, fed at times 
from side streams coming in from right and left. Sometimes the river 



ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS 



47 



may become wholly dry ; then the river springs up again to flow for a 
time copiously, with life-giving force, only to sink again from view. 
But finally God, fulfilling his purposes designed from the first, opens 
the heavens and gives such floods of rain that so start the stream from 
all its sources, that it shall never again run dry or spread out and be 
lost in desert sands. It will constantly widen and deepen until ulti- 
mately it will merge with the ocean, which is its home. So God's 
dispensations shall be gathered and flow into one, the Dispensation of 
the Fulness of Times. Your dispensation and mine, meaning the one 
in which we work ; God's dispensation, really, in the which he will 
gather together in one "all things in Christ, both which are in heaven 
and which are in earth, even in him." 

This, then, is the message of our Church voiced from Century One 
of our organized existence to the world — the incoming of the final 
dispensation of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. 

"Hear, O Heavens and give ear, O Earth, for God hath spoken !" 
The veil between heaven and earth has been rent from top to bottom. 
Heaven's pavilion is taken up, and God the Father and Jesus Christ his 
Son are revealed anew. 

God's plans and purposes in all the dispensations are made known, 
there has been a unifying of the truth of all the dispensations of God 
to men ward. 

The everlasting covenant, of which the blood of the Christ is 
both sign and seal, has been renewed. 

A true priesthood, which is God's power and authority given 
to man, which becomes God working through men, has been conferred 
on man in regular order of succession. 

The Church of Jesus Christ has again, and for the last time, 
been set up and made the depository of God's truth and the fulness 
of it ; and has been given the missiqn of proclaiming that truth and 
the fulness of it to every nation and kindred and tongue and people. 
Also to this Church has been given the high mission of perfecting the 
lives of those who receive its truth. 

The gathering of all Israel has been proclaimed, and the restora- 
tion of Judah to Jerusalem with commandment to resume his national 
life. 

Joseph, son of Jacob, his place as prince in Israel has been made 
known ; and to him has been given the gathering of the tribes, to receive 
their blessings at the hands of Ephraim, preparatory to going to their 
own and final lands of inheritance. 

The Record of Joseph in the hands of Ephraim, the Book of 
Mormon, has been revealed and translated by the power of God, and 
supplies the world with a new witness for the Christ, and the truth and 
the fulness of the Gospel. 

The Zion of God_. the capital of the empire of the Christ in 
the new world, the place of it is revealed, and for many years pro- 
claimed and will not be moved out of its place,

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Elias who held the keys of God's Church in the days of Abraham 
and blessed him, has restored the patriarchal powers and graces of 
the priesthood, to link together the families of men in patriarchal 
order, from now to the time of the end. 

Elijah, translated to heaven without tasting death, and therefore 
made the man of two worlds, heaven and earth, and by that token 
capable of working in each and both, has restored the keys of the long 
promised, priesthood that turns the hearts of the children to the fathers, 
and the hearts of the fathers to the children. In this first century of 
existence for the Church, and in consequence of this, Elijah's, mission, 
more than seven millions of baptisms for the dead have been per- 
formed, and more than fifteen millions of ordinances (including the 
baptisms) have been performed for the dead. Seven temples have been 
erected in various parts of the land of Zion, for a continuance of this 
holy work, and more will yet be builded. Think what that work may 
be when there are a hundred temples instead of seven ! 

Stakes of Zion are multiplied in the land of Zion, in Canada, in 
Mexico, in the midst of the Rocky Mountains, and also along the 
Pacific slope; and soon, as our first Prophet declared, and but three 
months before his death, cn the Atlantic seaboard likewise would 
stakes of Zion be organized, naming specifically stakes of Zion to 
be established in Boston and New York, and other great cities. The 
Atlantic ocean but washes the shores of Zion land on the east, as the 
Pacific ocean washes the shores of Zion land on the west; and the 
great interior valleys of the Mississippi and his mighty tributaries, 
will also be places for stakes of Zion, and the Gulf slopes — the south- 
land — as well. 

Zion is lengthening her cords and is strengthening her stakes, 
and multiplying her altars to the true God by the erection of temples, 
stake, houses, and chapels throughout the land. It seems to me that 
the chief activity of our President, Heber J. Grant, in late years, has 
become the dedicating of places of worship throughout and in all 
parts of the land of Zion. 

And these things will increase more and more. And while, as 
the prophets of the Book of Mormon foresaw, the possession of the 
saints upon the land of promise would be few, and scattered upon all 
the face of the promised land (I Nephi, chapter xiv:12), yet will they 
be multiplied until they shall become a mighty people ; and from among 
them will arise those who shall be able to move in upon and redeem 
Zion, the centerplace thereof, and fulfill God's word and purposes as 
to the mission of the capital city of the Christ's spiritual, growing 
empire in America. 

May men truthfully call this a work of narrow limitations? The 
business and work of a merely tolerated sect — one of the broken lights 
of God ? Or is it the beginning of a world movement for the decreed 
fulfilment of all the purposes of God? A world movement, I say, for 
the completion of God's purposes with reference to the establishment

of Zion, the salvation of men, the redemption of the earth and the 
fulfilment of all the words of the holy prophets since the world began ! 

A PRAYER 

And now, O God, the Eternal Father! Here as to an altar, I 
bring this work of mine, and dedicate it unto thee and to thy cause. 
If there is any way of excellence in it, I am sure, it is of thee, and 
unto thee belongs all glory and all praise and honor. As thy dear 
Son, the Christ, in the council before the world began, when accepting 
the mission to redeem the world, said, "Father, the glory be thine;" 
so now, in this so infinitely smaller matter, but I trust in that same 
spirit, I say in the presence of all these people, Father, the glory be 
thine for this work accomplished. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

The bouquet of beautiful flowers to my left was sent to me by 
Mr. Gus L. Becker of Ogden. With the flowers came a letter in 
which he states that during his forty years of residence here he has 
discovered that we are a God-fearing, honorable, upright people. 

The bouquet just behind me was sent by the various General 
Boards of the auxiliary associations. It is composed of one hundred 
roses. 

A solo and chorus, "I have seen my Maker face to face," was 
sung by Rilla Wilson and the choir. 

After the closing prayer was offered by Elder Henry H. Blood, 
President of the North Davis Stake of Zion, Conference adjourned 
until 10 o'clock tomorrow morning, April 7th. 



SECOND DAY 



MORNING MEETING 

The meeting began promptly at 10 o'clock a. m., Friday, April 
7th, President Heber J. Grant presiding. 

The music for this session of the Conference was furnished by the 
Provo Tabernacle Choir, under the leadership of Gerrit de Jong. 

Opening selection by the choir and congregation, "O say, what 
is truth?" 

Elder Lewis Anderson, President of the Manti Temple, offered 
the invocation. 

A sacred solo, "I sought the Lord," was sung by Anna Hinckley. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I had hoped yesterday to have time to read a number of telegrams 
that we have received. I had also hoped to hear from the Presiding 
Bishop of the Church, who presides over all of the members of the 
Lesser Priesthood — Priests, Teachers and Deacons — but it is a difficult 
matter of course to concentrate one's thoughts and stay within a limited 
time. 

CABLE MESSAGE FROM ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 

We shall not attempt to read the many telegrams that we have 
received from individuals, including leading business men in the United 
States and in Europe, but I would like to read a cablegram from one 
of the absent members of the Twelve Apostles. It is from Liverpool, 
dated April 4th : 

"First Presidency: The Church members of the European Missions number 
nearly thirty thousand with the missionaries about seven hundred strong, unitedly 
express joyous gratitude for the blessings of the Gospel and the present prosperity 
of the Church, and extend to you and the whole Church felicitations upon this 
happy occasion. May the Gospel, true to its divine purpose and history, spread 
over the earth to make multitudes glad through righteousness. 

John A. Widtsoe." 

FELICITATIONS FROM GOVERNOR OF WYOMING 

We have a telegram from Governor Frank C. Emerson of 
W yoming.

A cablegram dated Capetown, South Africa, April 6th, arrived 
before the conference meetings yesterday. They had held their services 
over there on the 6th of April and we received the word after they 
were over. It is from Don Mack Dalton, President of the South African

ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 

Presiding Bishop of the Church 

I rejoice, my brethren and sisters, in the splendid gathering of the 
saints this beautiful morning, and the wonderful gatherings that were 
held yesterday. I rejoice in the favor that is granted to me, in common 
with you, to take part in the exercises of this remarkable conference. 
I feel deeply grateful to the Lord that I am privileged to live in this day 
and age, and to enjoy the confidence of my brethren of the General 
Authorities, and of you, my brethren and sisters, the presidencies of 
stakes, bishoprics of wards, and all the members of the Church, so far 
as I may be worthy of that confidence. I can assure you that I desire 
to live to be worthy of it. I desire to serve you, because everyone who 
is called to any position in this Church is a servant of the people. 

EXTENT OF PRIESTHOOD MEMBERSHIP 

When the priesthood were gathered here yesterday, and when it 
was not possible for all to attend who desired to obtain seats, I was 
thinking of the problem that was before us— the First Presidency and 



52 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



those of us who had the seating of this building in hand — as to how we 
could accommodate those who desired to be here. There are 150,000 
members of the priesthood of the Church. Of course not nearly all 
of them could be here on that occasion, although many of them would 
have liked to come. Of those who are presiding officers of the stakes and 
wards and of the various quorums of the priesthood, there are fourteen 
thousand — practically double the seating capacity of this building, as 
at present. There is room for only six thousand in the body of the hall. 
Consequently it was necessary to cut down, very extensively, the number 
allotted to each stake of Zion. As a result, a large proportion of those 
who were seated here are the presiding officers of the stakes and wards 
and other high priests, as well as seventies and elders. There were not 
as many of the Aaronic priesthood as we should have liked to see, and 
as could have been seated here, had there been room for them to be 
seated. I am sure that there could have been two or three times the 
capacity of this building of Aaronic priesthood members who would 
have been glad to be here on that occasion, because they appreciated 
the memorable occasion, and what a tremendous influence it would have 
in their lives to take part in this centennial celebration. 

FRUITS OF THE GOSPEL 

I desire to read to you two or three quotations. One of these I 
was reminded of by the message of the First Presidency yesterday. 
When the Savior was delivering that remarkable Sermon upon the 
Mount, among other things he said: 

"By their fruits ye shall know them. Every good tree bringeth forth good 
fruit, but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. 

"A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring 
forth good fruit." 

I am reminded also of the wise man Solomon, who had been 
trained up in righteousness by his father, King David, and had become 
king of Israel under the most prosperous conditions, but who went 
astray and was led into transgression by reason of the luxuries he 
enjoyed. Toward the close of his life, after having tasted the bitter 
as well as the sweet of life, he wrote the book of Ecclesiastes, and in 
the closing verses of that book he makes the following declaration: 

"Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter : Fear God, and keep his 
commandments: for this is the whole duty of man." 

Now there is one other quotation I would like to present to you, 
and that is from one of the Lectures on Faith, contained in the fore- 
part of the book of Doctrine and Covenants : 

A religion that does not require the sacrifice of all things never has power 
sufficient to produce the faith necessary unto life and salvation." 

GROWTH OF THE CHURCH 

Frequent reference has been made already to the humble beginning 
of this work. I am reminded of its commencement in the pleasant 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 



53 



homestead of Peter Whitmer, in the township of Fayette, located in 
that beautiful western section of New York state — a section of rolling 
hills and lovely lakes. While those six men were met together I 
believe they appreciated to some extent the tremendous power that was 
in the work ; but whether or not they visualized its growth and develop- 
ment from that time to this is a question. When we think of those 
humble conditions in that obscure village, and then realize that today 
there are approximately seven hundred thousand members in the 
Church, located in all the states of this Union, in Canada and Mexico, 
in South America, in practically every civilized nation and on the 
Pacific islands, we comprehend what a remarkable growth it has had. 
Yet in all its development it has not lost in the least that humble faith 
and devoted spirit which characterized its beginning. When we sense 
also that in the hundred years that have elapsed since the beginning of 
this Church the most remarkable developments have occurred in the 
progress of civilization, and with those developments the Church has 
kept pace. It has met and helped to solve the problems of humanity and 
has presented divine truths which have changed and molded the spiritual 
thought throughout the world for good. The doctrines declared by the 
Church have been constructive in their nature. They have not tended 
to cause doubt or disbelief in the hearts of men. On the contrary they 
have helped to bring men to a realization of the fundamental truths 
which have been declared by prophets and seers in all dispensations. 

EFFECTS OF "MORMONISM" 

"Mormonism," it is said, and well said I think, enters into every 
phase of the lives of its members. It molds their characters in con- 
formity with these principles. It enters into their habits and influences 
them. It affects their physical beings and their mental development. 
It affects their hearts and their desires toward their fellow men. 

. What are some of the effects of "Mormonism?" What have been 
some of the effects in all the years that it has existed? I would like 
to discuss with you for a few moments a few of the practical things that 
may be evidenced in the lives, the habits and the characters of the Latter- 
day Saints. There are various things by which the faith and sin- 
cerity of the people may be measured. Particularly, there are three 
ways that I should like to consider with you wherein the devotion 
of the Latter-day Saints has been evidenced in their lives. It is 
said, as was stated by President Nibley yesterday, that "sacrifice 
brings forth the blessings of heaven." It is declared in the 
quotation I have read that any religion that cannot require the 
sacrifice of all things never has power sufficient to produce the faith 
necessary unto life and salvation. If Abraham had not had the faith 
necessary to conform to the command given him of the Lord to sacrifice 
his own son, Isaac, undoubtedly he would not have been able and worthy 
to receive the great blessings which our Eternal Father gave to him. 
His obedience to that command, even though it was not required at his 
hands, proved his devotion, his loyalty, and his entire and complete 
faith in God. 



54 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



The Latter-day Saints who have accepted the Gospel in faith, 
and with a real desire to serve the Lord, have conformed to the prin- 
ciples of the Gospel, even though they might require what would appear 
to be sacrifice on their part ; and yet I am sure that we all appreciate 
the fact that every sacrifice is a blessing in disguise. It is a means of 
progress and development for every one of us. 

RESTRAINT OF PHYSICAL APPETITES 

One of the ways whereby men may evidence their faith, integrity 
and sincerity in their religion, is by restraining and controlling their 
physical appetites, in conformity with the principles which are offered 
for their welfare. In the Word of Wisdom the Latter-day Saints have 
the finest set of rules that is to be found, I think, anywhere, affecting 
the physical being of the people, and also affecting their mental progress 
and development. 

Not long ago a member remarked to me that he had been in the 
East and had met a prominent business man in New York, who had 
inquired of him regarding the Mormon people. Among other things 
this local man had told him of the Word of Wisdom and of the 
stipulations and requirements contained therein. The man said to him : 
"Do your people observe that set of principles and instructions?" He 
replied: "Not entirely, but to a considerable extent." "Well," said 
the man, "if your people conform to those instructions, they will become 
the finest people in the United States or anywhere else in the world, in 
physical vigor and in mental development." The Lord has said to us 
that these instructions are given for the weak and the weakest of all 
saints, who are or can be called saints, and when the Lord says that to 
us, it ought to be sufficient, whether it be in the way of a .suggestion 
or a commandment. It means that when the Lord gives a commandment 
it is intended for the progress, the welfare, and the blessing of those 
to whom it is given. 

FAITH .PRODUCES WILLING OBEDIENCE 

During all these years, the Latter-day Saints have, in large 
measure, observed the Word of Wisdom. There are some people who 
complain that no church has any right to direct what one shall or shall 
not eat or drink. On the other hand, if we accept the proposition that 
spiritually we are the sons and daughters of God, that these bodies are 
created in his image, that the Holy Spirit should enter and be a part of 
our tabernacles and inspire us, and that the Lord expects of us that we 
shall be physically sound, it is by all means important that we should 
learn to control and regulate our appetites and desires and keep these 
bodies clean in order that we may be entitled to enjoy the Spirit of the 
Lord and draw near to him. But there is no compulsion in this or any 
other principle of the Gospel. We have our free agency. If we obey, 
we gain the benefits and the privileges accruing therefrom. 

RESULTS OF OBSERVANCE OF WORD OF WISDOM 

Now what has been the result of the observance of the Word of 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 



55 



Wisdom on the part of the Latter-day Saints? I cannot tell you in 
so many words, but I can quote to you some of the statistics that come 
into our office with regard to the vital conditions among the Latter- 
day Saints. We cannot say, for instance, how many members of the 
Church have cancer. But we can say how many members of the 
Church die of cancer, and that is a very important thing among people 
today, because cancer is a serious disease ; and so with various other 
maladies. The death rate among, the Latter-day Saints for the last few 
years has averaged about 7.5 per thousand. The average death rate 
of the United States registered area, which includes the most progressive 
states, is 11.4 or rnore per thousand. In other words, the Latter-dav 
Saints' death rate is only about two-thirds of the death rate throughout 
the United States. 

ANALYSIS OF RESULTS 

Let us analyze that a little farther, as to the causes of death. 
Among other things we find that in the matter of what are known as 
epidemic, endemic and infectious diseases, the death rate in the United 
States is more than double what it is among the people of this Church. 
The Lord has declared to us that scourges should come over the earth, 
and that if we will observe his commandments we shall escape those 
scourges. Not entirely, probably, because we are all subject to death. 
In a measure, we are all subject to diseases. But as I see it, through 
the observance of the Word |pf Wisdom, we are promised at least 
partial escape from many of these scourges. In the matter of diabetes, 
which is also a disease of some considerable concern among mankind, 
the death rate in the Church is approximately half that of the United 
States average. 

EFFECTS OF NARCOTICS 

It is recognized that tobacco and spirituous liquors are causes, at 
least in part, of cancer, and in this respect we find that the death rate 
in the Church as compared to the United States is less than half. 
In the matter of nervous diseases, it is recognized also that certain 
stimulants affect the nervous system. The death rate from diseases 
of the nervous system in the Church is less than half that of the United 
States. In the matter of kidney and kindred diseases, which are also 
affected by the use of stimulants, the death rate throughout the Church 
is about one-fourth that of other parts of the country. The death rate 
from diseases of the heart and circulatory system in the Church is ap- 
proximately one-half that of the United States average. 

Are not these records ample evidence to you that the observance of 
the Word of Wisdom is worth while ? Are not these the fruits of a good 
tree? Of course, we ought to observe this or any principle because the 
Lord has made it known to us. That ought to be sufficient, but when 
we examine the effects produced we find that we are fully justified, 
from a material standpoint, in observing it. 

RESISTANCE TO MORAL TEMPTATIONS 

There is another way in which men and women can demonstrate 



56 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



their faith and sincerity and that is by resisting immoral tendencies, 
by refusing to do those things which we have been advised are vicious 
and contrary to the word of the Lord, as affecting relations between 
the sexes. The influences of today throughout the world are such as to 
undermine moral standards. Virtue and chastity are apparently not 
considered of great concern. The Latter-day Saints recognize the fact 
that strict morality is of the utmost importance. We have been taught 
to abhor immorality and unchastity. The Lord has declared to us that 
those who practice sexual transgressions will degenerate, and cannot 
retain the Spirit of the Lord, which is the spirit of life and truth and 
virtue. 

BENEFITS OF HIGH MORAL STANDARDS 

Now what are the evidences as to the benefits of the observance 
by the Latter-day Saints of high moral standards as compared with 
other people ? I would like to take the opportunity to give you certain 
government statistics. The Church does not keep record of births out 
of wedlock, but the government records for Utah and Idaho, where 
the majority of the Latter-day Saints live, as compared with the rest 
of the United States, show that the illegitimate birth rate in each of these 
two states is less than one-third. And that is true also of still-births out 
of wedlock. Is that any evidence to you as to the benefits of the 
observance of the declarations of God and the teachings by the leaders 
of this Church with regard to the proper relations between the sexes? 

THE MARRIAGE RELATION 

Then taking the other phase of that relation, that is, marriage, 
the Latter-day Saints have been taught continually that marriage is a 
sacred obligation, and that it should be undertaken, not only for this 
life but for eternity as well. Mutual respect and consideration between 
husband and wife, and continuance in the marriage relation, are, like- 
wise, evidences of the faith and uprightness of the members of the 
Church. The bearing of children and the proper training of those 
children is enjoined as a responsibility that every married couple should 
undertake. The proper training of children, as well as the bringing 
of them into the world, is of great importance. 

MARITAL STANDARDS 

What are the results of this training among the Latter-day Saints, 
comparatively ? We find that the marriage rate throughout the Church 
as compared with the government statistics for the nation, is about 
43% greater. The birth rate throughout the Church is about 45% 
higher than that of the United States generally. The infant mortality 
rate in the Church is approximately 62% that of the United States. 
It is interesting to note, further, that the divorce rate throughout the 
Church is only about 40% of the United States average, and that the 
divorce rate of those who were married in the temple is only about 18% 
that of the United States, or about 43% of the total divorces in the 
Church. Isn't that evidence also of the real benefits denved from the 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 



57 



observance of these divine instructions? Those who are married 
properly, who have taken upon them these covenants in the temples 
and have seriously and with due appreciation of the responsibility, 
promised to maintain this bond in affection not only for this life but 
for eternity, have been so impressed with this obligation that they are 
able to live together in love and joy and peace. 

FAITH EVIDENCED BY LIBERAL GIVING 

There is one other way that I would like to refer to briefly whereby, 
it seems to me, the faith and sincerity of the members is clearly shown. 
It is said that a man's pocket-book is very near to his heart. I am told 
that Michiavelli, a diplomat engaged in Italian affairs of state in the 
middle ages, a keen, wily schemer, and politician, expressed this state- 
ment — whether it be true or not — "You may kill their fathers, you may 
take away their wives and daughters, you may destroy their brothers, 
and they will forgive you, but you dare not touch their pocket books." 
That indicates his idea, at least, as to how precious one's pocket book 
was. But when men and women will give liberally and consistently of 
their means and of their time for the welfare of their fellow men, it 
is surely an evidence of their faith and sincerity. The true Latter-day 
Saints have been and are giving liberally and devotedly through the 
observance of the law of tithing and the making of donations for the 
poor and for other purposes. They have shown, I think, a remarkable 
spirit of giving of their means, and of their time and labor, because they 
understand that these are commandments of the Lord. 

INDIVIDUAL GROWTH 

What are the results? Well, in an individual way, the result has 
been to overcome sordid selfishness, produce loyalty and exhibit more 
positive faith in God and his work in the hearts of those who have 
observed these things. Brotherly kindness has increased. Financial 
integrity has been promoted. Individual honesty has been strengthened, 
and the cooperative spirit developed. Men become more charitable. 
The finer qualities which make for character, and enhance peace and 
joy and love in the earth are brought out. The spirit of service which 
makes for greater community welfare is being encouraged. 

Then, in a spiritual way, what are the effects? The tremendous 
missionary work that the Church has carried on, the preaching of the 
Gospel to mankind everywhere, has been made possible not only by the 
observance of the principle of tithing, but by the giving of time and 
additional means individually by the missionaries and through their 
parents. 

MATERIAL PROGRESS 

Again, in a material way, what has been produced ? The building 
of a great number of community buildings, of temples and of ward 
and stake meetinghouses. Further, there is the large Church educational 
program, and the extensive service rendered in the care of the poor. 
I think there is no other people anywhere that is doing as much pro- 



58 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



portionately, in the way of erecting fine places of worship and social 
centers. Also the effect is to develop in the members the spirit of 
thrift and the desire and determination to meet their obligations 
manfully and provide for their needs. The Church is undertaking to 
qualify its people as a whole to secure greater equality and mutual 
consideration so that everyone, as far as possible, shall properly develop. 
It causes everyone to seek to increase his or her earning capacity ; not 
only for their own welfare but that they may be able to help the 
Church in larger measure and to be of greater usefulness in the com- 
munity. All of these things result therefrom. 

RENEW OUR COVENANTS 

Now, in that which has been presented here, it is not intended to 
boast of the Latter-day Saints. The desire has been to show that the 
observance of these principles produces lasting blessings in the lives of 
those who have faith. My brethren and sisters, we have reached the 
end of this first century of the Gospel restoration gloriously, and stand 
on the threshold of the second, which is fraught with even greater 
events than have occurred heretofore. Shall we not here and now renew 
our covenants with the Lord, and solemnly pledge ourselves individually 
and unitedly to serve God and keep all his commandments, to prepare 
for sacrifice and bring forth the fruits of right living? May the Lord 
help every one of us to do this, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

President Heber J. Grant read the following letter and message 
from Elder Reed Smoot : 

March 29, 1930. 

"President Heber J. Grant, 
47 East South Temple Street, 
Salt Lake City, Utah. 
Dear President Grant : 

"As you are aware, it is impossible for me to attend the April Conference. 
I regret it more than words >can express. I enclose you a short statement, which 
I would like to have you present to the Conference if agreeable to you. 

"May God's blessings ever attend you and may the coming Conference be 
one of the great epochs in the history of the Church is my desire and prayer. 

Your brother, 

(Signed) Reed Smoot." 

Apostle Reed Smoot, who is unavoidably detained by his duties 
in the nation's capital, sends greeting to this conference his most 
cordial good wishes and a message in these words : 

ANNOUNCEMENT OF TRUTH IN THE RESURRECTION 

Ages ago, when the Son of God, in mortal tabernacle, stood before 
a human judgment seat in the city of Jerusalem, the Roman procurator 
asked him, "What is Truth?" 

That query has been of vital significance to mankind in all the 



ELDER REED SMOOT 



59 



succeeding ages, and was never more vital than at this very time and 
on this present occasion. Only a few days after the scene in the 
Roman court, visitors to an empty sepulchre, seeking to view the body 
of the crucified Jesus of Nazareth, were accosted by a heavenly mes- 
senger who said concerning him : "He is not here : for he is risen." The 
angel's words were the announcement of a wonderful Truth, of para- 
mount importance to, all mankind. The resurrection of the Redeemer 
and Savior of the world had come to pass. 

. TRUTH REVEALED THROUGH JOSEPH SMITH 

More than one hundred years ago, to specify as to time and place, 
in the spring of 1820, near the town of Palmyra, state of New York, 
there came a divinely manifested vision to a young man, Joseph Smith, 
who was of Israel's birthright heritage and who earnestly sought the 
truth. That vision was the appearance of God the Eternal Father and 
his Son, the resurrected Jesus of Nazareth. Pointing to the other heav- 
enly Personage, God gave witness : "This is my Beloved Son, hear him." 
It was the divine revelation in this age of the resurrected Christ. It 
was the Truth. Multitudes in Palestine and adjacent countries had no 
knowledge of or belief in the resurrection on the day of its first an- 
nouncement, but its truth has permeated the ages since then and has 
brought life, and hope, and joy, to myriads of our fellowmen. Mul- 
titudes in this and other lands had no knowledge of or belief in the 
revelation of the resurrected Redeemer to the young man Joseph Smith 
on the day of its occurrence, 'but its truth today is permeating people 
in all lands, and will grow to a perfect knowledge in the due time 
of the Lord, because that revelation is God Almighty's Truth, and will 
prevail. 

Some years later, in May, 1829, there came the restoration of the 
Lord's priesthood authority to administer the required ordinances of 
the Gospel ; and in the next year there followed the publication of the 
divinely revealed word known as the Book of Mormon and the event 
of which we celebrate the one hundredth anniversary at this April 
Conference, namely, the organization of the Church of Jesus Christ, 
for the accomplishment of God's great purposes among men in this 
latter-day dispensation, known in scripture as the Dispensation of the 
Fulness of Times. Further organization and divine revelation suc- 
ceeded this event, until April 3, 1836, when the revelation of the fulness 
of the Gospel was completed by the appearance of other heavenly mes- 
sengers with the keys of their respective dispensations, the culminating 
one being the promised coming of the Prophet Elijah with the keys 
of the priesthood authority which he held, and that prophet's announce- 
ment to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery that "the keys of this dis- 
pensation are committed into your hands, and by this ye may know 
that the great and dreadful day of the Lord is near, even at the door." 

More than twelve years before this latter date, on September 21, 



60 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



1823, God had promised to Joseph Smith, through an angel, that he 
would send to him the prophet Elijah, with the mission to "plant in 
the hearts of the children the promises made to the fathers, and the 
hearts of the children shall turn to their fathers." Among millions 
of our race today, outside of membership in the Church as well as with 
those inside, this prediction is being verified in a truly wonderful man- 
ner. These millions are seeking to know of the promises made to their 
fathers ; and truly in the world today there is wide turning of the hearts 
of the children to their fathers in genealogical research through records 
of ages agone. These facts and many others bear indubitable evidence 
that the revelation of the Gospel to the Prophet Joseph Smith and others 
in this age is God's Divine Truth. To this fact I bear my most solemn 
testimony on this occasion. 

PERSONAL DESIRES 

It is my earnest, sincere desire that in my calling my preaching 
shall be, as the Lord directs, "the warning voice, in mildness and in 
meekness." To be qualified for the work all engaged therein are re- 
quired to show forth hope, charity, and love; to "remember faith, 
virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, brotherly kindness, godliness, 
charity, humility, diligence;" and to beware of pride and a cold haughti- 
ness such as weak humanity often is prone to. 

My desire also is to convey to my brethren and sisters, and to all 
my friends, a message that to me seems of great worth on this par- 
ticular occasion. Thousands of years ago, when Israel was before 
Mount Sinai under the leadership of their great Prophet Moses, God 
gave to Israel statutes and commandments, with promises of great 
blessing if these were kept, and predictions of punishment for wrong 
doing if disregarded ; for Israel had taken upon them his name. Among 
those commandments was one which carried a peculiar and remarkable 
promise. That commandment was : 

BLESSING IN KEEPING THE SABBATH 

"Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary. I am 
the Lord." 

The promise for obedience was that their enemies should not 
prevail against them, but Israel would prevail. This command and 
promise are recorded in the twenty-sixth chapter of the book of Le- 
viticus in the Old Testament, second, seventh and eighth verses. All 
during the thirty-three succeeding centuries when Israel has remem- 
bered to keep God's sabbaths and reverence his sanctuary, the promised 
blessing has attended them in that obedience. It also is manifest in 
the nations whence we gather Israel today, wherever the command rela- 
tive to the sabbath and sanctuary is observed. That observance is of 
great moment to the saints at this time, if they would receive the 
divine blessing. It is momentous and needful because it is divine Truth. 

My word and message to my fellowmen everywhere today is that 



ELDER REED SMOOT 



61 



the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ set forth in his revealed scriptures 
is the plan of salvation and of peace to the world ; that while it is 
commendable in men to seek peace by every honorable means, the great 
peace for humankind comes only through the potent, sacred, divine mis- 
sion of the Man of Galilee, whose mission is God's Eternal Truth. God 
bless you all, in Jesus' name. 

A solo and chorus, "Let all on earth their voices raise," was sung 
by Lavar Isaacson and the choir. 



ELDER JONATHAN G. KIMBALL 

Of the First Council of Seventy 

I am very grateful to the Lord that I am permitted to be present on 
this occasion. I feel that I am among my friends, and have always 
tried to feel that way. I have only one great big desire and that is to 
live until I have fulfilled and completed my mission here upon the 
earth. The revelations tell us that if we desire to serve the Lord we 
are called to the work. I have a burning desire in my heart to follow 
in the footsteps of my father, and to he loyal and true and faithful, and 
to be found among the number that sustain God's work and uphold the 
hands of his holy priesthood. 

I realize, in part only the great responsibility that is resting on the 
Presidency of this Church and the Council of the Twelve and all those 
who take part in this great work. I believe Joseph Smith is one of the 
greatest prophets that has ever lived. I believe in his prophecies and 
revelations. While I may be among the number that would like to 
rush things on a little, to see how they are coming out, in Jackson 
County and all that, I am sure that all will be literally fulfilled in 
the due time of the Lord. 

Whenever the Lord wants to speak to his people he knows whom 
to talk to. I have known President Grant during my labors in the 
First Council. I have slept with him and talked with him, but I 
haven't slept with him since he has been President of the Church. 
I know of no better man. I am not one of those who cater to men. 
I sustain them and uphold them, but I have learned that they are 
human. I sustain and uphold, with all my heart and soul, President 
Heber J. Grant as the prophet of God. It was only two months ago 
that a young lawyer — I suppose he considers himself one of the 
brilliant young lawyers — undertook to criticize severely the President 
of the Church. I was somewhat disturbed. I said, "I am going to 
take out my watch and give you five minutes to name a better man." 
I haven't heard from him yet. I want to say to you, in full faith and 
confidence, no man has ever earned his place as the prophet of God, 
through loyalty, faithfulness, devotion and sacrifice, more than Pres- 
ident Heber J. Grant. 



62 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



I realize that this is a serious work. I have had more joy and 
more happiness — real joy and happiness — when in the service of the 
Lord, when standing before the people and testifying of the truth of 
this- work, than at any other time. True it is I may have said things 
that would have been better unsaid. Unfortunately, I have tried 
to say some things that haven't been understood, but I know that this 
work is true, as well as I know anything. If there is anything I know, 
as far as my testimony goes, it is that this is the work of God ; that 
God is our Father ; that Jesus Christ is the Redeemer of the world. 
Joseph Smith is and always will be a prophet of the living God, and 
his prophecies and revelations will come true. I know it is needful 
to have a little joy, a little peace and happiness in this world of ours, 
which is full of sorrow, death and misfortune. I get a good deal of 
joy sometimes from very simple things. I couldn't help but think this 
morning of one man talking over the radio, getting a hundred fifty 
thousand dollars a year. No one ever gave me a nickel for any joy 
that I ever gave him. I think we need a little cheer, a little helpfulness, 
and a little encouragement. I have a matter that I would like to read 
to you. It will take me only a few minutes. 

"It is a very old, old story; but it never needed retelling so much as in 
this present hour : His name was Joseph, and he was carried away from home, 
and found himself in Egypt, a strange new land. Because he was good looking 
and intelligent and a hard worker he rose rapidly until he became prime minister. 
Except the king, there was no other man in Egypt more influential or more 
celebrated." 

His relatives learned with interest of his rise. They followed into 
Egypt, and with his help they too prospered and were likewise influential. 
It looked as though they were permanently provided for, as though 
nothing could happen to dislodge them. But in a single generation — 
yes, in a little fraction of a generation — the unbelievable occurred. 
The people who were so contented, so free from all concern, were 
hurled from their high position into the bitterness of slavery. The 
thing that had happened to them is recorded in a single sentence, 
"Joseph died." That has not been the case with the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints. Joseph the prophet died, but the Church 
has continued to progress and advance and will until it completes its 
mission. A new generation has arisen. "A prophet in the wilderness 
was still crying, but there was no one to heed — there was scarcely 
anyone to listen — material force was in evidence in its might." It 
seemed so foolish to rely on so slender a thing as divine support. 
It ought to be self-evident to a pagan that arrogance and earthly power 
can vanish over night, for all that is not built upon God shall -fall._ 
To trust to material standards of strength brings calamity — material" 
force, as apart from God and opposed to him, cannot succeed. 

A new generation has arisen. The people seem so content, so 
free from all concern; but like the Jews in the days of Joseph, they 
can be hurled from their high position into the bitterness of slavery. 

We older men think our story should be told of our pioneer fathers 



ELDER JONATHAN G. KIMBALL 



63 



and mothers, and the faith of our ancestors ; and we write a book, preach 
a sermon or two and think our task is ended. This new generation that 
have arisen have discovered over night that a new world has been 
born and that the United States of America is about tp assume the 
responsibility of saving the world and they are content and satisfied. 

At no time in the history of this great nation has there been greater 
danger than for this new generation. The danger comes from ease, idle- 
ness and luxury, as there never was a time when the people were spend- 
ing their means as prodigally as now and ever reaching out after 
material things. 

The prodigal dollar seems to be swallowing all that is great and 
noble in the nation. 

To my mind the Mormon people are becoming content and self- 
satisfied — they show evidence of falling down in their spiritual efforts. 
It seems to me, a great deal of that which has been gained by faith, 
adversity, sacrifice and years of hard work is being let loose of. Our 
fathers and mothers died for the faith and we are living on the faith 
of our pioneer ancestors. But behold, another generation has arisen, 
and in the very instant of our self-content the silence is broken by our 
being hurled from our mighty purpose. Joseph Smith, the mighty 
prophet, was chosen of God to send forth the message of salvation to 
the children of men. He was martyred, but that was not the end. 

Brigham Young rightfully succeeded him; and his followers with 
him fled to the Rocky Mountains. Brigham Young led the way for the 
first trekkers of adventuresome spirits in the year 1847 who were the 
original builders in what Daniel Webster christened the "Great American 
Desert." On entering the Salt Lake Valley divine intelligence at once 
manifested itself in all his deliberations. "This is the place." There 
beats in the heart of this great man, a leader, a prophet of God, a great 
load of care — the destiny of his people. 

One has to believe to understand the destiny, object and purpose 
of this people. The leaders understood and believed. They knew — 
God revealed it to them. President Brigham Young and his followers 
said, "We will make this barren waste bloom and furnish clean unsullied 
wealth for thousands of poor people from all over the world, who have 
been crushed under the Juggernaut of our Christian civilization — we 
are going to plant them under the shadow of the Rocky Mountains, 
we will create an Eden out of the desert ; we will lay out town- 
sites and cities and build churches and schoolhouses and raise wheat and 
vegetables. God's children shall be converted to the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ and be given land. They shall have a chance for life, liberty 
and the pursuit of happiness. They shall know their toil will bring 
them some returns so that they can have a home and a hope for the 
future. 

It was a big thought, a great idea, manifested by divine intelligence. 
He was a prophet. He had a vision of the future. The great leaders 
did not want the land and water for themselves ; they wanted men to 
be God's agents — stewards for God — and hold the land in trust as a 



64 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



sacred inheritance. This land was to belong to the lowly of the earth 
and to be saved for the hewers of stone and the drawers of water. 
These valleys in the mountains were to be made to bloom and blossom 
for the poor- whose hope is the land that gave them birth and life and 
would receive them in its bosom when they died and made a safe 
return to the Father of all. 

Just take the time to think of the thousands of acres of lonely 
thirsty land waiting for centuries, to be reclaimed from the ruins of ages. 
They saw in vision green fields and farms just as Joseph Smith pro- 
phesied it would be. "It is the place" where you'll find all the things 
your souls are hungering for ; where the people will own big farms, with 
green fields of wheat and alfalfa with purple blossoms and long rows of 
fruit trees and vegetables. All will be most beautiful in a desert. It 
was a vision, a dream come true. Nobody was there to despoil their 
dream. 

A new generation has arisen. Think of your pioneer fathers and 
mothers who built better than they knew. Think of the men, women 
and children toiling in sweat shops, with little food, families without 
money, without hope and without fuel, facing cold winters in these 
great cities, who have been gathered to a barren empire which our 
ancestors have transformed into an Eden. A land of liberty — a home 
for the oppressed of God's children, where they can have life, liberty 
and the pursuit of happiness, and worship God according to the dictates 
of their conscience. The stranger has found his way amongst us and 
many of us have sold our inheritance for a mess of pottage and are 
seeking elsewhere, hoping for more ease, more idleness, more luxury. 
In this once lonely sage-covered, wind-swept valley there should be 
erected a granite monument and written thereon this epitaph : 

"Who seeks for heaven alone to save his soul, may keep the path, but will 
not reach the goal; while he who walks in love may wander iar, yet God 
will bring him where the blessed are." (Henry Van Dyke.) 

On an occasion in San Francisco, on March 16, 1924, young Elder 
Larkin handed this to me. On that occasion J. G. Kimball prophesied 
that "before many of you go to the other side, you will all have burning 
desires in your hearts to return to the places where the leaders of the 
Church have counseled the saints to settle and you will give anything for 
a home there." 

God bless you. Amen. 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH. 

I am honored this morning in being permitted to worship with this 
wonderful congregation, to find myself numbered among those who are 
considered worthy to assemble in the name of the Lord. I desire sin- 
cerely that the time occupied by me may be profitable to you ; and will, 
therefore, appreciate an interest in your faith and prayers, that I may 
be led to say the things that will be helpful. 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 65 



I rejoiced exceedingly during the sessions of yesterday and last 
evening, and there wells up in my soul a feeling of thanksgiving to him 
from whom all blessings flow. I am one of those who believe in the 
teaching of the Bible, that "man was created in the image of God." Last 
night, as I beheld the beautiful pageant portraying the various ages of 
the world and conditions that have existed, I felt to thank my Father in 
heaven that my lot has been cast in this day and with this people. 

* 

THE WAY PREPARED 

In the Bible we read, in the third chapter of Amos : 

"Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto 
his servants the prophets." 

I believe that, and I believe that all down through the ages, as re- 
corded in holy writ, the Lord has vindicated that statement. The prep- 
aration for the ushering in of the Gospel of Jesus Christ in this latter 
dispensation was indicated in the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, and repeat- 
ed again in the days of the Apostles, and then the foundation was laid 
for the organization of the government of the United States by men and 
women who believed in the divine mission of Jesus Christ. The stage 
was not set hastily ; it was preparing through hundreds of years. We 
who live in this marvelous age may look back and see that throughout 
the centuries our Heavenly Father has fulfilled his promises to his chil- 
dren, and the people or nation that has observed the laws of God and 
honored his commandments has been blessed; while those who have 
been recreant to their opportunity have suffered calamity and in many 
cases entire destruction. Our Heavenly Father prepared the way for 
the coming of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, which was to precede the 
second coming of our Lord. 

HIS PROMISES FULFILLED. 

The Doctrine and Covenants contains several revelations given by 
the Lord before he organized his Church. Among them was this one 
— and I call attention to it as evidence that the Lord fulfills his promises. 
In February, 1829, one hundred and one years ago, this revelation was 
given through the Prophet to his father. By the way, this revelation 
was given at a time when the people of the world did not believe in new 
revelation, when they did not accept the idea that God could speak again 
from the heavens, and those who believed that he could or would were 
ridiculed. But the Lord did speak, and this is what he said : 

"Now behold, a marvelous work is about to come forth among the children 
of men. 

"Therefore, O ye that embark in the service of God, see that ye serve him 
with all your heart, might, mind and strength, that ye may stand blameless be- 
fore God at the last day. 

"Therefore, if ye have desires to serve God ye are called to the work." 

This was before the Church was organized, before the priesthood 
had been so widely conferred and when men were called to the work in 
an orderly way. 



66 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



"For behold the field is white already to harvest; and lo, he that thrusteth 
in his sickle with his might, the same layeth up in store that he perisheth not, 
but bringeth salvation to his soul ; 

"And faith, hope, charity and love, with an eye single to the glory of God, 
qualify him for the work. 

"Remember faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, brotherly kind- 
ness, godliness, charity, humility, diligence. 

"Ask, and ye shall receive; knock, and it shall be opened unto you." 

god's church. 

A hundred years ago yesterday the Lord commenced this work. He 
had predicted it himself, and had called attention to the fact that it was 
to be a marvelous work. No man could have fulfilled that prediction, 
but our Heavenly Father has fulfilled his promise; and in the year 
1830, on the 6th day of April, he organized his Church. I would like 
to emphasize that, as I believe with all my heart that it is his Church, 
not the Church of Joseph Smith or of Brigham Young or of John Taylor 
or of Wilford Woodruff or of Lorenzo Snow or of Jpseph F. Smith or 
of Heber J. Grant ; for while these men have been his faithful represen- 
tatives upon earth, it is not their Church, but it is the Church of the 
Redeemer of mankind. 

THE LABORERS IN THE VINEYARD. 

At that time he gave certain information. I shall not take time 
to read that (Section 21) but I call attention to the fact that in it 
the Lord said : 

"For behold, I will bless all those who labor in my vineyard with a mighty 
blessing, and they shall believe on his words, which are given him through me by 
the Comforter, which manifesteth that Jesus was crucified by sinful men for the 
sins of the world, yea, for the remission of sins unto the contrite heart." 

I call attention to the fact that he made a promise that he would 
bless all those who labored in his vineyard, and since that time thousands 
of men and women have gone into the world to advocate the truth. I 
have met and visited with hundreds, yes, and with thousands of them 
myself, and I have never heard one bear any other testimony than that 
the Lord had blessed him and given him great joy when he labored 
in his service. 

I was thinking today of the Smith family, chosen by the Lord to 
be instrumental in beginning this work. I checked over in my mind the 
number of the descendants of Asael Smith, the Prophet's grandfather, 
who have given a portion of their lives in the* mission field. I find that 
in that family alone more than two hundred years of faithfulness and 
devotion in advocating the Gospel of Jesus Christ have been thus spent. 
It is marvelous when you think of what has been accomplished, and how 
the Lord has fulfilled his promise. 

THE WORDS OF THE BOOK. 

One hundred and one years ago this very day, Joseph began the 
translation of the Book of Mormon, and Oliver Cowdery became his 
scribe. We have a copy of that wonderful book here upon the pul- 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 67 



pit. Hundreds of thousands of them have been distributed in the world. 
Ridiculed though it was at the time, it contains a special promise. I 
will read that promise. The Prophet Nephi said, as you will find in 
the thirtieth chapter of the second book of Nephi : 

"Now, I would prophesy somewhat more concerning the Jews and the 
Gentiles; for after the book of which I have spoken shall come forth and be 
written unto the Gentiles and sealed up again unto the Lord, there shall be many 
which shall believe the words of the Book." 

That statement was in the manuscript in the hands of the printer, 
and was there with the knowledge of Joseph Smith and his associates 
who assisted in translating the record. At that very time the people 
in the neighborhood of Palmyra and Manchester had already declared 
that they would not buy the book, that its publication would be a failure 
if they could make it a failure, and the copies that were to come from 
the press would be wasted. Had that book been written by Joseph 
Smith himself I am sure that passage would have been deleted, that 
"many shall believe the words of the book." But it was the word of 
the Lord, through Nephi. Has that prophecy been fulfilled? What 
are the facts? The book has been translated and published in fifteen 
different languages, and is translated in several other languages. Ap- 
proximately a million people have believed it and accepted it as a sacred 
record. It has been generously distributed among the children of men. 
In a hundred years nothing has been discovered that would set aside the 
statements that are contained therein, and the things that have been un- 
covered by archaeologists and others have demonstrated the truth of the 
historical facts contained in the Book of Mormon. One hundred years 
have passed, and surely many have believed the words of the book. The 
prophecy has been fulfilled. Our Heavenly Father caused that it should 
be written, and he always fulfils his promise. 

THE LORD WORKING AMONG THE NATIONS 

In the same chapter we find the following : 

"And it shall come to pass that the Lord shall commence his work among 
all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, to bring about the restoration of his 
people upon the earth." 

Has he fulfilled that promise? If there be anybody in this house 
past seventy-five years of age who will take the time to think of what 
has occurred since the Book of Mormon was first published, he will 
discover that almost every implement, almost every convenience now 
enjoyed by mankind, has come since the Book of Mormon issued from 
the press in the year 1830. We are witnesses this. day that in a hundred 
years this world has made progress along most lines greater than in all 
the previous centuries since the earth was created and our first parents 
came upon it. The Lord said he would commence his work among the 
nations. Man had had his trial ; men for thousands of years had worked 
at it. But when the Lord set his hand and when he began to quicken 
the minds of men by the inspiration of his holy power men began to work

out wonderful inventions that have changed the entire condition of this 
world. I say to you that after a hundred years we are living in a new 
world. But the work of the Lord has only just begun. 

Oh, how my soul thrilled last night as I beheld the pageant that 
was presented before us of the ages that have passed. It was called 
most forcibly to my attention that we who live in luxury today do not 
appreciate what our .forbears have passed through. The scene of our 
pioneers toiling across the plains touched my heart, and tears dimmed 
my eyes as I thought of them under the burning sun's rays and in 
many cases in the snow ; and remembering that my own father was born 
on the way, I asked myself : Am I living to be worthy of the sacrifices 
that were made by men and women such as these ? I hope I am. I hope 
I appreciate this blessing. 

GROWTH IN A CENTURY. 

This is our Father's work. In a hundred years we have made 
great progress. Do you realize that in a hundred years after the organ- 
ization of the Church with six members there has been more than 
one hundred thousand people converted for each one of those six 
whose names appear as the organizers of the Church? One hundred 
thousand for each one in a hundred years. Multiply that by our present 
membership, and if we should do as well in the next hundred years, con- 
sidering our present membership, do you know what it would mean? 
Not three fourths of a million people, but more than seventy billion 
people would be members of the Church of Jesus Christ. Can you not 
see how a marvelous work and a wonder has been going forward ? Can 
you not see how we as individuals have only contributed our mite, but the 
multitude has united, and the word of the Lord has been disseminated 
among the children of men ; not in a militant way, but in kindness and in 
love, with a desire to bless all mankind. 

GRATITUDE FOR BLESSINGS 

If I interpret the spirit of this conference it is a spirit of love, a 
feeling of thanksgiving to him who is the author of all our blessings. 

I stand here today one of the humblest among you, profoundly 
grateful to my Heavenly Father for my membership in this Church, and 
for the knowledge that he has given to me of its truth, for my associa- 
tion with these men who are my close companions in life, and for the 
privilege of mingling with the members of this Church throughout the 
land. I, too, am thankful for the friendship of great and good men 
and women throughout the world, who have not yet understood the 
purpose of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and how I hope and pray that 
because of our upright lives, by reason of the continued development of 
this work and of the power of truth as it has been made manifest in the 
last hundred years, these too may be made to understand, and that they 
with their children and their children's children may become members 
of the fold of Christ and receive, an inheritance in his celestial kingdom. 

God grant that we who have been so bountifully blessed may hold

up the hands of the servant of the Lord who presides over us ; that we 
may help him not only by our faith and prayers but by loving kindness 
as opportunity offers; that we may march under the banner that he 
shall hold aloft as God continues to sustain him as President of the 
Church, as the prophet of the Lord in these latter days. 

I know that God lives. I know that Jesus is the Christ. I know 
that Joseph Smith was a prophet of the living God, as I know that I 
live ; and I bear you witness of it in humility and in loving kindness, in 
the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen. 

ELDER RULON S. WELLS 

Of the First Council of Seventy 

My heart has been filled to overflowing and I have been greatly 
thrilled with the spirit of this great occasion, this great celebration 
of the one hundredth anniversary of the organization of the Church. 
I rejoice this day over the glorious truths that have come to light in 
the restoration of the Gospel of our Redeemer. 

Those who were present at the pageant last night must have been 
impressed with the magnitude of this work. The story told in symbol 
contemplates the "Message of the Ages," the work of the Lord. It had 
its beginning before the foundations of this earth were laid. It has been 
one great struggle between good and evil, a great struggle for the 
liberty of the children of God. This work contemplates an exercise 
of free agency, of liberty. It is for the purpose of making men free 
and securing unto them their inalienable rights, which they, of neces- 
sity, must exercise in order to obtain eternal life. There can be no 
salvation in compulsion. There can be no reward through compelled 
obedience. But when men elect in the free exercise of their agency 
to serve God instead of serving mammon, thereby do they comply with 
the conditions of salvation. 

This Gospel is a plan of liberating mankind from bondage. "The 
whole world lieth in sin, and groaneth under darkness and under the 
bondage of sin" (Doc. and Cov. 84 :49) , but the truth from heaven has a 
mission to perform, namely, to liberate us and make us free. It is no 
wonder that the Latter-day Saints have espoused the great cause of 
human liberty, that they regard this great government of which we 
form a part as having been inspired of Almighty God, that they regard 
the Constitution of our land and that instrument that preceded it, 
known as the Declaration of Independence, as being inspired of the 
Almighty for the salvation and the protection of the children of God. 
We rejoice in being citizens of this great republic, the freest country 
in all the world. Its principles, the very foundations upon which it has 
been established, are set forth in that Declaration of Independence, 
wherein it is stated that "all men are created equal and that they have 
been endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, among 
which are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness." Let it not be felt 



70 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



that these rights are given to us by any government. Not so. We live 
not because a government has given us the privilege to live; we live 
because God gave us life. We are free not because any government has 
given us our liberty — we are free not because we have received that 
power and that right from any human source; we are free because 
God made us free. 

The Lord inspired the fathers of our country, our Revolutionary 
fathers, with this same spirit of human liberty, this right of free agency. 
This great struggle for liberty did not begin on this earth; it began 
before the foundations of it were laid. The Lord devised the plan 
whereby we might be liberated and made free and independent. The 
Lord designs that we shall be so. There was war in heaven before the 
foundations of this earth were laid. And what was that great conflict 
over ? It was a struggle for the liberties of the children of God. 

What is freedom? What is liberty? Does it mean license to do 
evil? No, indeed it does not. To be free means to liberate ourselves 
from the bondage of sin. We, in this country, boast of our human 
liberty and we have great reason to be proud of the liberty that we 
enjoy under our Constitution; but after all is said and done it is only 
a measure of civil liberty, but the greatest measure to be found among 
all the governments of the world. We sometimes boast of being in the 
land of the free, the heme of the brave. Nevertheless, we are not free 
until we have overcome evil — until we liberate ourselves from the 
bondage of sin. 

The Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ is destined to make us free. 
It is the truth revealed from heaven that will make all men free if 
they will only render obedience to it. This plan of free agency was 
opposed by the enemies of God, foremost among whom was Lucifer, 
even in that primeval day when the plan of life and salvation was first 
promulgated among the children of God, when it was made known that 
they could come upon this earth and receive bodies of flesh and bones 
and live this earth life, in the exercise of their free agency. 

"To live and to be free, 
To worship God alone, 
As conscience guideth me, 
As my own heart is prone. 
These are rights God-given ; 
He gave them all to me. 
They emanate from heaven — 
E'en life and liberty." 

There is none in all the world who feels more deeply than we do 
the import of our popular national hymn : 

"Our fathers' God ! to thee, 
Author of liberty, 
To thee we sing; 
Long may our land be bright 
With freedom's holy light, 
Protect us by thy might, 
Great God, our King !"

ELDER RULON S. WELLS 71 

What a blessed boon is liberty. The free agency of man! The 
right to live upon the earth with a knowledge of good and evil. Blessed 
are we if we choose the good and reject the evil, provided, of course, 
we do so of our own volition, in the exercise of our free agency. 
Many there were even in the very beginning who opposed this plan. 
We are told in holy writ that one-third of the hosts of heaven followed 
Lucifer in his rebellion against God and were cast out of heaven. 
That war begun in heaven, is continued here on earth. To follow 
the enemies of God means to follow them into slavery, but to serve 
God means freedom, and we are under necessity of choosing whom 
we will serve — God or the adversary of our souls, the arch enemy of 
God. Many there have been in all ages who have endeavored to en- 
slave mankind — to dominate the minds and consciences of men. All 
such are enemies of God. They have instituted despotic governments 
and have ruled with an iron hand. They have established state religions 
and punished non-conformists as heretics and even burned them at 
the stake. All enemies of God are they who seek to destroy the free 
agency of man or to deprive them of their inherent — their inalienable 
rights of life and liberty, the right to worship God according to the 
dictates of their own consciences. The establishment of a state religion 
is an abomination in the sight of God. Think of poor afflicted Russia 
now under Soviet rule. How they have suffered in the past under the 
despotic rule of the Czar, and dominated by a corrupt hierarchy — an 
established state church, enslaving and oppressing them! 

The people of that land had good reason to rise up against such 
conditions and all sympathy should be extended to them in their 
struggle for liberty ; but no sooner have they liberated themselves from 
this condition of thralldom till the . Soviet seeks to plunge them into 
the still more deadly slavery of atheism. These Soviet masters are 
still greater oppressors and tyrants than any who have ever preceded 
them, for they have even undertaken to prevent them from serving 
God in any form whatever, and when men cease to serve God, at that 
moment they begin to serve the devil, which means slavery. Such 
rulers have no conception of human rights. What they need is a 
Thomas Jefferson to write into their constitution a provision like this : 
The Soviet shall make no law respecting the establishment of any re- 
ligion, nor prohibiting the free exercise thereof. They have surely 
broken down the establishment of a state religion, but they have also 
undertaken to prevent the free exercise of any religion — to deprive 
their people of their inherent rights. Tread lightly, ye powers that be, 
for this is holy ground. Even in our own land there are some who 
seem to think that our Constitution is unfriendly to religion. On 
the contrary, it is intended to encourage and protect all religions. It 
simply means "equal rights to all, but special privileges to none," — no 
state religion, but no interference with any. This is holy ground. To 
congress it says "hands off." 

How grateful we ought to be for those champions of human. 



72 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



liberty that have arisen in our own land — for George Washington, "the 
father of his country," who led our forces in establishing this free 
republic, founded upon the principles of human liberty ; for Abraham 
Lincoln, the great emancipator, who under the inspiration of the Al- 
mighty, carried on the fight to preserve unto us these sacred rights 
that they might not perish from the earth ; for Woodrow Wilson, who 
led the American forces in the greatest struggle of history for human 
liberty, and that these priciples that we love so dearly shall be extended 
to all mankind. The influence of these great champions of human 
liberty will be felt by the inhabitants of this world throughout the ages 
which are to come. 

Let us, then, as Latter-day Saints, rejoice in the precious boon 
of liberty secured unto us by that great palladium of our inherent rights, 
the Constitution, and manifest our loyalty to it by obedience to it and 
the laws which have been enacted in carrying out its provisions. Let us 
also rejoice in the free agency of man which permeates the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ and manifest our appreciation of it by our obedience to 
that Gospel which is the "Truth that will make us free." This I pray 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

"The glory of the Lord shall be revealed," from the oratorio, "The 
Messiah," was sung by the choir. 

Elder George F. Whitehead, President of the St. George Temple, 
pronounced the benediction, and the Conference adjourned until 2:00 
p. m. 

AFTERNOON MEETING 

Conference reconvened at 2 :00 p. m. 
President Heber J. Grant presided. 

The music for this meeting was furnished by the Provo Tabernacle 
Choir, under the direction of Gerrit de Jong. 

The choir and congregation sang "Come, come, ye Saints." 

Elder David K. Udall, President of the Arizona Temple, offered 
the opening prayer. 

The choir sang the anthem, "As the hart pants after the water- 
brooks." 

ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 

MEANING OF IMMORTALITY 

At a time when Moses was caught up into an exceeding high 
mountain and face to face talked with God, an account of which is given 
in the first chapter of the Book of Moses, in the Pearl of Great Price, 
the God of heaven and earth made use of this very significant and im- 
pressive expression: 

"Behold, this is my work and my glory, to bring to pass the immortality and 
eternal life of man." 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 



73 



Immortality and eternal life as here used by the Lord, I under- 
stand to mean exaltation in the celestial kingdom. That represents 
the aim and object — the end in view, with the Lord, in all his works. 
To obtain an exaltation was the end we had in view in the beginning. 
It should be so with us now and throughout our life. 

The cobbler seemed to understand this principle who on being 
asked, "What is your vocation or business?" answered, "My business 
is to serve the Lord — I mend shoes for a living." 

THE PLAN OF SALVATION 

The purpose of our existence in this life then is to prepare for 
eternal life in the world to come. -The Lord in the beginning instituted 
the plan by which this might be accomplished. The plan provided is the 
Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, including the work of a Savior, and 
Jesus Christ is the Chosen One. No other plan has the Lord provided 
for man's salvation ; and any other plan that might be presented from 
any source would be rejected of the Lord, and should be by us, also, 
just as was the plan proposed by Lucifer in the beginning. 

Next to our own salvation, of importance and interest to us, is 
the salvation of those whom the Lord has given to us — our own flesh 
and blood; and then the salvation of others — the living and the dead. 

The greatest service one can render to his fellowman is that of 
assisting him to obtain salvation. Such is the character, directly or in- 
directly, of all our church work, including the work of the home minis- 
try and that of the ministry abroad. It is pure religion and undefiled. 
Its importance calls for our very best efforts, as individuals and as a 
church. 

EARLY PERSECUTIONS 

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has lived through 
a century of varied experiences, and has passed through much tribula- 
tion. It has builded cities and temples from which its members have 
been driven by ruthless mobs — self-styled enemies of the Mormon 
people. Our Prophet Joseph and his Patriarch brother, Hyrum, were 
murdered in cold blood by a brutal mob, for their religion's sake. 
Many of the saints have suffered death at the hands of their enemies 
and through exposure to the inclement elements while being driven 
from their once peaceful and happy homes. 

My father's brother, George Spencer Richards, at fifteen years of 
age was fairly butchered with about twenty other members of the 
Church, men, women and children, at Haun's Mill, Missouri, Oct. 30, 
1838, and their bodies were thrown into a well for burial. No word 
or pen can adequately picture the physical and mental distress and 
suffering experienced by the Latter-day Saints during the early part of 
the century, while representing the Lord in the establishment of his 
Church, and the restoration of the Gospel. But Mormonism subsists 
and ever will, for God is at the helm. 

The accomplishments of the Church and its people during the first 



74 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



century of its existence are marvelous and wonderful. The pageant 
being presented in connection with this centennial conference is por- 
traying in an impressive manner some of the leading features of our 
work and accomplishments. But, notwithstanding all that the Church 
and its members have accomplished during the first century of its ex- 
istence, to which our minds are being directed during this conference, 
there is much that we have undertaken that we have been unable to 
accomplish. However, we are in no wise discouraged. 

SACRIFICES REQUIRED IN THE GOSPEL 

We could scarcely hope to be more successful in an effort to 
convert the world than were the Lord's people of former gospel dis- 
pensations. Mormonism is just about as popular today as was Christi- 
anity in the primitive Church. The Mormon Prophet, Joseph Smith, 
is accepted about as generally today as were Jesus and his disciples 
in their day, or as were the prophets who preceded them. The Gospel 
truth never has been generally accepted. It is a standard of life that 
is too high for most folks to live. Jesus Christ is the only person who 
through life lived up to the Gospel standards in all respects and at all 
times. The best of saints are but striving to walk in the footsteps of the 
Master. Many have not the courage to undertake it and therefore do 
not embrace the Gospel. 

The Gospel of Jesus Christ is one of sacrifice and self-abnegation, 
such that too many are willing to hazard their chances of salvation rather 
than to receive the Gospel and make the necessary sacrifices. Salvation 
is a gift of God freely given to his children who are willing to pay the 
price — the price to be paid is acceptance of the Gospel and obedience 
to its precepts. Certain principles are to be accepted, ordinances to be 
received, commandments to be kept, laws to be obeyed, service to be 
rendered, evils to be avoided and sacrifices to be made. 

It is no small matter for one to give to his church year after year 
one-tenth of his interests and income and meet other financial obligations 
of church membership. It is no small sacrifice made by many thousands 
of our people in leaving home and loved ones and going abroad to 
engage in the ministry and missionary work from two to four years 
at a time, and in many instances filling two or more such missions. The 
home ministry of the Church also makes important demands upon the 
time and efforts of its members. Our faith in the words of the Savior 
is absolute and he has declared most emphatically that unless we are 
willing to lay down our lives for his cause, we are unworthy to be his 
disciples. We desire to be worthy disciples , of the Master, and if we 
are, we will be willing to lay down our lives for his cause ; and if we 
are thus willing followers of our Lord, there is no demand that can 
be made upon us, looking to the advancement of his work, to which 
we will not cheerfully respond. 

PREACHING THE GOSPEL FOR A CENTURY 

Our present corps of missionaries consists of about two thousand 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 



75 



men and women scattered throughout the various nations of the earth 
and the islands of the seas. In money and time it is costing the Church 
and the membership thereof about three million dollars annually. For 
and during a hundred years we have been carrying on this missionary 
work in the discharge of a sacred religious duty and obligation to 
preach this Gospel of the Kingdom' in all the world as a witness unto 
all nations before the end comes ; and with a view to rendering to 
mankind a service the greatest one person can render another. To make 
such sacrifices requires faith, conversion, and courage such as but few 
possess. 

For a hundred years we have tried to convince the world of the 
truth that there is a God in heaven ; that he is the Creator of all things, 
the Giver of all good ; that he is the Father of the spirits of all men ; 
that Jesus Christ is the first born of the Father in the spirit and the only 
begotten of the Father in the flesh; that under the direction of the 
Father, the Son is Creator of all things, and that he is the Savior and 
Redeemer of the world, the very Messiah. 

For a century we have been telling the world that God the Father, 
and his Son Jesus Christ, are ^separate, immortal and glorified beings, 
each having a body of flesh and bones and spirit as tangible as the 
body of man, and that we are all created and made' in his image and 
likeness ; that all his attributes are manifest in us, his children, they 
having been inherited by us through our spiritual birth ; that by per- 
fecting these God-like attributes we become like him in character as well 
as being like him in form. 

For a century we have been trying to convince the world of the 
fact that God our Heavenly Father and his Son Jesus Christ, have 
revealed themselves anew in this Dispensation of the Fulness of Times 
to and through the instrumentality of a boy less than fifteen years of 
age; that in answer to earnest, anxious prayer, both the Father and 
the Son visited him and talked with him, and made known to him the 
fact that there had been a universal departure from the faith and that 
the .Gospel was about to be restored and that he, Joseph Smith, if 
faithful, would become their representative in accomplishing the restora- 
tion. 

For a century we have been trying to show to the world that 
the scriptures teach the truth pertaining to God the Father and his 
Son, Jesus Christ as revealed to Joseph Smith by their heavenly pres- 
ence. 

While addressing a class of college students who were in training 
for the ministry, upon the subject of Deity, Henry Ward Beecher said: 

"I am compelled to say that I must form an ideal of God through his Son, 
Jesus Christ. Christ is indispensable to me. My nature needs to fashion the 
thought of God, though I know him to be a spirit, into something that shall nearly 
or remotely represent that which I know. I hold before my mind a glorified 
form, therefore; but, after all the glory, whatever may be the nimbus and the 
effluence around about it, it is to me the form of a glorified man. And I 
therefore fashion to myself out of the spirit, that which has to me, as it were, 



76 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



a divine presence and a divine being — namely, a divine man." (Lectures on 
Preaching, page 129.) 

If Henry Ward Beecher and the Latter-day Saints find in the 
scriptures evidence that God is a divine and glorified man, why cannot 
and why do not other religionists do likewise? The facts remain that 
despite our efforts the bulk of the Christian-Sectarian world prefer 
to believe God to be something different from what he really is. 

For a century we have been trying to convince the world of the 
fact that there had been a general falling away from the truth prior 
to 1820, when the Father and Son appeared to Joseph Smith, that 
the authority to administer the ordinances of the Gospel had been with- 
drawn from the earth, in fulfilment of prophecy, and that the Gospel 
in its fulness, with all its ordinances, gifts and blessings has since been 
restored, with authority to administer its ordinances to the repentant 
believer. 

For a century we have tried to show to the world from the scrip- 
tures that baptism is necessary to man's salvation; that baptism sig- 
nifies immersion and that immersion was the only form of baptism known 
and practiced in the primitive Church until several centuries A. D., 
and that the changing of the mode of baptism from immersion to 
pouring or sprinkling is without authority and fulfils the prediction of 
Isaiah with respect to the last times, "The earth, also, is defiled under 
the inhabitants thereof, because they have transgressed the laws, 
changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant." (Isaiah 
24:5.) 

For a century we have taught that children who die before arriving 
at the age of accountability, eight years, have eternal life, being re- 
deemed from the foundation of the world through the atoning blood 
of Jesus Christ; and that for such, baptism is not necessary, nor ap- 
proved of the Lord. 

For a century we have denounced pedo — or infant — baptism as 
being unscriptural, unreasonable and in conflict with revealed truth; 
yet the practice of sprinkling infants continues. There are certain 
quolifications candidates for baptism must possess, as prescribed by the 
scriptures, which only those of understanding can possess. If their 
mode of baptism were right, and their subjects worthy and eligible, 
without the necessary authority which is found only in the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, their administrations would be of 
no virtue as affecting the salvation of the candidates. 

EXPERIENCE SAME AS IN FORMER DAYS 

Our experience has not been unlike that of prophets and saints 
of other Gospel dispensations. We find Isaiah saying: 

"Who hath believed our report?" (Isaiah 53:1.) 

And the author of the epistle to the Romans : 

"But they have not all obeyed the Gospel. For Esaias says, Lord, who hath 
believed our report?" (Romans 10:16.) 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 



77 



And the words of the Savior: 

"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets and stonest them 
which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children 
together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would 
not!" (Matthew 23:37.) 

Then Jesus said unto them : 

"Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while you have the light, lest 
darkness come upon you; for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither 
he goeth. 

"While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children 
of light. These things spoke Jesus and departed, and hid himself from them, 

"But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not 
on him: 

"That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled which he spake, 
Lord, who hath believed our report ? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been 
revealed?" (John 12:35-40.) 

If they believed not in Jesus who wrought such mighty miracles 
among them, and taught them as no other person could do, we will not 
be discouraged though but few believe our report. 

It is a satisfaction to have been right, and a disappointment to 
have been wrong upon any question that may have engaged our atten- 
tion; and the more important the question, the greater the satisfaction 
or the disappointment, as the case may be. 

MEANING OF SALVATION 

The most important question that has ever engaged the attention 
of man is that of salvation, of what it consists and how it may be 
obtained. There is, perhaps, no other question upon which there has 
been such a diversity of opinion and understanding. 

As sure as there is a life beyond the grave and that the soul of 
man is immortal, and there is nothing more sure, the time will come 
when it will be universally known who are right and who are wrong 
in their understanding of salvation. Then will the satisfaction and the 
joy of those who have been right be supreme; and the disappointment 
and sorrow of those who have been wrong will be terrible to endure. 

We who have accepted the true gospel of the Redeemer, and by 
so doing, know of the doctrine, would have our f ellowmen to accept 
it also and thus avert the terrible consequences of a mistaken conception 
of the all-important question of salvation. 

Wje have the responsibility to preach this Gospel of the kingdom 
in all the world for a witness unto all nations before the end shall 
come ; and we are trying as a Church and the membership thereof to dis- 
charge ourselves of this important and sacred obligation. 

THE PROPHET JOSEPH'S INSPIRED WORDS 

In the language of the Prophet Joseph: 

"Shall we not go on in so great a cause? Go forward and not backward. 
Courage, brethren; and on, on to the victory! Let your hearts rejoice, and be ex-

ceeding glad. Let the earth break forth into singing. Let the dead speak forth 
anthems of eternal praise to the King Immanuel, who hath ordained before 
the world was, that which would enable us to redeem them out of their prison; 
for the prisoner shall go free. 

"Let the mountains shout for joy, and all ye valleys cry aloud, and 
all ye seas and dry land tell the wonders of your Eternal King! And 
ye rivers, and brooks, and rills, flow down with gladness. Let the woods 
and all the trees of the fields praise the Lord; and ye solid rocks weep 
for joy ! And let the sun, moon, and the morning stars sing together, 
and let all the sons of God shout for joy! And let the eternal creations 
declare his name forever and ever ! ^nd again I say, how glorious 
is the voice we hear from heaven, proclaiming in our ears, glory and 
salvation, and honor, and immortality, and eternal life; kingdoms, princi- 
palities, and powers ! 

"Behold, the great day of the Lord is at hand; and who can abide the 
day of his coming, and who can stand when he appeareth? For he is 
like a refiner's fire and a fuller's soap and he shall sit as a refiner and 
purifier of silver, and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold 
and silver, that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness. Let 
us, therefore, as a Church and a people, and as Latter-day Saints, offer unto 
the Lord an offering in righteousness ; and let us present in his holy temple 
* * * a book containing the record of our dead, which shall be worthy of all 
acceptation." (Doc. and Cov. 128 :22-24.) 

That we may be able to do so and be prepared for his second and 
glorious coming which is nigh at hand, is my humble prayer. 

ELDER DAVID O. McKAY 

"Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, 
What seek Ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, where abidest thou? He 
saith unto them, Come and see." 

"What seek ye?" "Master, where abidest thou?" "Come and 

see." 

These three significant expressions were probably uttered imme- 
diately following the Savior's return from the Mount of Temptation. 
"What seek ye?" is the first recorded utterance of the Savior of men 
as he entered upon his public ministry. The question, "Master, where 
abidest thou?" was asked by two disciples of John the Baptist, un- 
doubtedly, Andrew and John. 

In that second question, I read some such meaning as this : "Rabbi, 
where can we find Messiah ? Where may we obtain deliverance from 
the oppression of Rome, or, possibly, deliverance from the, evils of our 
age?" The Savior's answer is most significant and important. If I 
may put it in my own words I read in that "Come and see," isuch a 
fact as this : If you will follow me, you yourselves may discover the 
way." 

"what seek ye?" 

My purpose in calling your attention to this text this afternoon 
is to apply those questions to the world today. Suppose that the Son 
of Man said to mankind in the present age, "What seek ye?" what would 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY 



79 



be the answer? Many would say: We seek pleasure; some, wealth; 
others, fame and power; but the most thoughtful would answer, We 
are seeking the light of the ages, as mankind has ever sought. We are 
seeking a social Utopia. We want a society in which we may be relieved 
of some of the ills of mankind, free from the troubles and toils of life. 

UNSUCCESSFUL EXPERIMENTS 

With every progressive age of the world intellectual, noble-minded 
leaders have sought for a better way of living than that which was 
current. The good life, a social Utopia, has been the quest of the ages. 
To sense the need of reform has been easy ; to achieve it has been diffi- 
cult and often well-nigh impossible. Ideas and suggestions proposed 
by the wisest of men have seldom been practical, often fantastical ; yet 
in most cases the world in general has been made better by the dissem- 
inating of new ideas, even though the experiments proved failures at 
the time. In this respect the century just past has been no exception. 

The first half of the 19th century was marked by a general feeling 
of social unrest. Observant people became dissatisfied with social and 
economic conditions, and thinking men sought for remedial changes. 
In France, early in the century, the fanciful theories of Charles Fourier 
were circulated. He attempted to outline the future history of our 
globe and of the human race for eighty thousand years. Today his 
books aren't even read. Robert Owen founded a commercial society at 
New Harmony, Indiana. Although supported by a fortune that he had 
amassed by intelligent and frugal efforts, and although he was |en- 
couraged by the Duke of Kent who became his patron, his scheme 
for the betterment of mankind came to naught in 1827. He returned to 
England where he tried several similar experiments with the same result. 

George Ripley, a Unitarian minister, conceived a plan of "plain 
living and high thinking." He had as his associates such able men as 
Nathaniel Hawthorne, Charles A. Dana, afterward assistant Secretary 
of War in the United States, and John S. Dwight. Ripley's impulse 
was really religious rather than economic, and "was due to a kind of 
monastic desire for withdrawal from a sordid world rather than a desire 
for a new society." He and his associates became the founders of what 
was known as the Brook Farm, a "Great Experiment" as it was called, 
to make the world an agreeable place to live in. It came to an end in 
1846. 

"Some of these Colonies" writes Phillip Russell, "were religious 
in purpose, others educational, and still others economic ; but all, includ- 
ing Brook Farm, were social symptoms — rashes and growths indicating 
a sick and strained America." 

THE CHURCH AS A SOCIAL ORGANIZATION 

It has been charged by a cynical writer that the Mormon Church 
was but one more excrescence of the fermenting body politic of this 
religious-social reaction.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



It is true that "religious excitement" led Joseph Smith to seek the 
right church, the proper mode of worship, the right way to live. A desire 
to know this impelled the youth to seek the Lord for wisdom in the 
spring of 1820, the greatest result of the answer to his prayer being the 
organization of the Church, in Peter Wihitmer, Sr's. home, on Tuesday, 
April 6, 1830. 

In considering the Church purely as a social organizaton having as 
one object, at least, what other worthy organizations had in view; viz., 
the amelioration of social ills, and the advancement of mankind, it is well 
to keep in mind at the outset the facts : 

First: That Joseph Smith was unschooled and "unacquainted 
with men and things." Undoubtedly, he had never even heard of Fou- 
rier's phalanxes, the Owen experiment, nor any other scheme, religious 
or economic, for the bettering of social conditions ; 

Second : That the six original members were practically unknown, 
were financially poor, and had no political or social standing; and 

Third : That Joseph Smith did not organize the Church by man's 
wisdom but by divine direction, "in accordance with the order of the 
Church as recorded in the New Testament" . 

For one hundred years this organization has survived financial 
panics, social upheavals, and religious turmoil, and today conforms to 
the best concepts of sociologists as a means of supplying the highest 
needs of mankind. 

CHURCH GOVERNMENT IN GENERAL 

"Government represents the authority of the group, usually exer- 
cised in an external coercive way, to enforce the will of the group upon 
its individual members." That government is best which has as its aim 
the administration of justice, social well-being and the promotion of 
prosperity among its members. 

Considered politically the world is upset at the present time in its 
opinion as to the best form of government. Wb are just witnessing the 
downfall of monarchies. Rising from these monarchial ruins have come 
democracy as exemplified chiefly in Great Britain in her dominions and 
in the United States; the dictatorship of the proleteriat as in Soviet 
Russia ; and the Fascist regime in Italy, with Mussolini as chief dictator. 
It is apparent that men are seeking for a better form of government than 
most nations now have. Will they find it in the government by a dictator 
or in the government by the people, or in a combination of both ? 

One clear writer, Mr. Kirkpatrick, says that "Efficiency and prog- 
ress are favored when the government is such that the local community 
has a great deal of responsibility of its own affairs and the central gov- 
ernment has final authority to introduce those institutions and rules of 
procedure that have been shown to be permanently useful." 

Now my fellow workers, and thinking honest men of the world, 
take that fundamental definition of true government and see how admir- 
ably the Church of Jesus Christ conforms to it. A careful analysis of 



ELDER DAVID O. McKAY 



81 



the organization of the Church reveals the fact that it embodies all the 
strength of a strong central government and every virtue and necessary , 
safeguard of a democracy. 

First, it has the authority of priesthood without the vice of priest- 
craft, every worthy man being entitled to a place and a voice in the 
governing quorums. 

Second, it offers a system of education, universal and free in its 
application — the safety valve, the very heart and strength of a true 
democracy. 

Third, it offers a judicial system that extends justice and equal 
privileges to all alike, applicable to the poor and to the millionaire. 

Fourth, in its ecclesiastical groupings of stakes and wards and 
branches and districts, efficiency and progress are enhanced inasmuch as 
every local group attends to its own affairs, and yet each is so closely 
united with the central government that every mode of procedure proved 
useful and beneficial to the people can be adopted without delay for the 
good of the entire group. 

Truly, from the standpoint of enhancing efficiency and progress, the 
Church of Christ has that form of government which the nations today 
are seeking. 

A REVERSION TO THE TEACHINGS OF CHRIST 

This is because it is patterned after that order which Christ himself 
established. I call your attention again to the fact that the Prophet Jos- 
eph stated on the 6th day of April, 1830, that the Church was organized 
after that order given in the New Testament. I read recently in a book 
published last year by Charles A. Ellwood, Ph. D., L. L. D., author of 
"The Social Destiny of Man," that "The religion of the future cannot 
be based upon historical Christianity, but must, in order to avoid mis- 
understanding, go back to the teachings of Christ, as recorded in the 
Gospels." Isn't it significant that a young man not twenty-five years 
of age, unacquainted with the social systems of his age, or of any age, 
should have realized and declared one hundred years ago just what this 
thinker realizes today ! 

Says the sociologist of 1930: "The religion of the future must go 
back to the teachings of Christ, as recorded in the Gospels." 

Said Joseph Smith one hundred years ago : "The Church of Jesus 
Christ was organized in accordance with the order of the Church as 
recorded in the New Testament. And the practical and beneficent work- 
ings of the organization prove its divine authenticity." 

FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS 

Mr. A. Euston Haydon, author of "The Quest of the Ages," names 
four fundamental elements as an ideal of the satisfying life: 

First: Man must feel a sense of security in regards to the basic 
needs of living. He must have food, shelter, proper family relation- 
ships and protection, and a recognized place in the group. 



82 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Second: Religion must contribute to the joy of personality, by 
permitting individuals to share in racial and cultural achievements. This 
calls for an educational discipline for poise and self-control, ability to 
think, in order to live more abundantly and free and to achieve kindness 
and tolerant sympathy for all people through understanding. 

Third: The joy of human comradeship. No other community 
or organization in the world offers sweeter, more wholesome comrade- 
ship than does the Church of Jesus Christ. The love of husband and 
wife is an eternal bond, not sealed lightly in frivolity or passion but 
entered into by premeditation, careful observation, sacred association 
and prayer. The laughter of little children is music in the well-ordered 
home, and youthful pleasures and associations in home, ward society 
and auxiliary organizations, quorum service, and mutual helpfulness 
from babyhood to old age, offer an opportunity for comradeship that 
fills the soul with a joy that is unknown to the sordid and self-indulgent. 

Fourth: The joy of contributing something of value to the com- 
mon life. 

Another writer, scanning the social needs of the world today with 
clear vision declares that "A church that will enthuse men not only for 
the redemption of individuals but for the redemption of communities 
and of mankind may never arrive. But if not, the cause of Christ will 
perish from the earth. 

"I see the church as a life-boat launched to save a stranded world 
perishing amidst material prosperity, misdirected scientific achievements, 
and moral decay." 

The author quoted says further: "We are witnessing either the 
crumbling of civilization under the weight of its material mechanism, 
or the birth of a new world organization with a' spiritual ideal." 

My testimony is that we are witnessing the birth, or rather the 
continuance of a great spiritual enlightenment. 

WHAT OF THE FUTURE? 

What of the future ? "Come and see." "Life abundant, beauteous, 
laughing life," more brotherhood, securer peace, better social relations 
are some of the fruits of Mormonism as seen by the eye of faith. 

"The increasing prospect tires our wandering eyes. 
Hills peep o'er hills, and Alps on Alps arise." 

Can you not see many nations yet to hear the truth — Jew as well 
as Gentile ! India and China both awakening, Russia but in the throes 
of the birth of a new nation, a new religious freedom it must be. God 
will overrule it, for that people must hear the truth, and the truth in 
simplicity. Truly there is much for the Church to do in the coming 
century ! 

THE SOLUTION OF SOCIAL PROBLEMS 

Brethren, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has in it 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY 



83 



all that the world would require. I am not associating political govern- 
ment with our religious government ; I am merely pointing out that sys- 
tem of organization established by the revelations of God to man. 

Let me conclude : The Church, established by divine inspiration 
to an unlearned youth, offers to the world the solution of all its social 
problems. It has stood the test of the first century successfully. In 
the midst of brilliant concepts of men in this twentieth century, who 
seek conscientiously for social reforms and who peer blindly into the 
future to read the destiny of man, the Church shines forth as the sun 
in the heavens, around which other luminaries revolve as satellites of 
minor importance. Truly it is the creator and preserver of man's high- 
est values. Its real task, the redemption of our human world. "It is the 
light of truth radiating everywhere in the world, and this light cannot 
fail to reveal to man, sooner or later, the divine ideals by which man 
should live." 

God help us and qualify us for the mission of carrying to the 
world this light. May we labor even more zealously than heretofore for 
the establishment of a social order in which God's will shall be done on 
earth as it is in heaven — a kingdom of God which shall foster the broth- 
erhood of man and acknowledge the fatherhood of God. May we so 
live that men seeing our good deeds may be led to glorify our Father in 
heaven, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 

Of the Presiding Bishopric 

I had hoped my turn to take part in this great conference would 
come a little later, that I might have time to partake more of the spirit 
of the occasion. For the last few weeks I have tried to fix in my mind 
something I might present to this conference, only to find each thought 
pushed aside with a vision of carpenters, painters, electricians, drapery 
hangers, printers, and the task of greeting the mass of people who 
come here expecting to view the wonderful pageant which is being 
given. I have gone home in the evening dizzy, and during the night have 
dreamed of stacks of colored cardboard tickets with a hundred thousand 
people pleading for them. Such temporal duties have left very little time 
to think of the spiritual, which above all else, at this time is of the 
greatest importance. And so I come before you relying wholly upon 
the Spirit of God, praying for your prayers, for the mercy of the Lord, 
that I may at least bear testimony to the truth of this great work. 

I was impressed this morning with the remarks of Bishop Cannon 
in his reference to the Word of Wisdom, and I hope I may call to 
your attention some of the specific requirements of that revelation 
which was given to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 
through the Prophet Joseph Smith, ninety-seven years ago, three years 



84 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



after the Church was organized. It was given for a principle with 
promise, adapted to the capacity of the weak, or the weakest of all 
saints who are or can be called saints. It applies to all alike; none 
is exempt. 

As we stood here yesterday morning when President Grant called 
for a standing vote from that great body of men holding the holy 
priesthood, I was thrilled, for it was certainly a glorious sight. More 
than seven, thousand men stood up. They are leaders in Zion, clean 
in mind and body. They are, indeed, temples of the living God, 
temples in which the Spirit of God dwelleth. They are spiritually 
minded men whose lives are given to thought and work, not alone of 
this life, but also the preparation for an exaltation in the life to come, 
eternal life, not in the telestial or terrestrial kingdoms of our Father, but 
in the celestial where he dwelleth. Every man in this building yesterday 
morning was, I believe, an observer of the Word of Wisdom as far as 
it pertains to the use of wine, strong drink, and tobacco, not .because the 
Church requires that its officers refrain from their use, but because of 
their faith and their desire to merit the blessings God has promised 
his children. 

It is unnecessary for me to tell you why liquor and tobacco are 
not good, for I believe you know as well as I the bad effects upon the 
body and spiritual condition of Church members who use them, but 
I am not so sure that we all understand this revelation in its reference to 
other matters of equal importance. The other day a prominent doctor, 
not a member of the Church, asked me if I ever read Section 89 of the 
Doctrine and Covenants. I answered that I had read it at least once 
a month for years and that obedience to its teaching had saved me from 
the doctor's knife. He answered that he seldom retired at night 
without reading it, and that he never reads it that he does not receive 
some helpful suggestion ; and then he added, "I tell you, if your people 
would read it and observe it to the letter, there would be very little 
for doctors to do, for in my opinion, it is the greatest health document 
in existence." 

Through that revelation we are warned that "in consequence of 
evils and designs which do and will exist in the hearts of conspiring 
men in the last days," we are to be warned and forewarned. It was 
given for the benefit of the council of High Priests and all the saints 
in Zion, and was to be sent greeting, not by commandment or constraint, 
but by revelation, and the Word of Wisdom showing forth the order 
and will of God in the temporal salvation of all saints in the last days. 
"Given for a principle with promise, adapted to the capacity of the 
weak and the weakest of all saints, who are or can be called saints." 

First, wine, strong drinks, tobacco, and hot drinks are mentioned 
as being ,"Not good in the sight of our Father." Because tea and coffee 
are not mentioned, some excuse themselves in their use, for they say 
they do not take them hot. I heard a brother sometime ago, perhaps to 
justify himself in his desire to indulge his appetite, say that he would 
not be surprised if someone would come along and attempt to forbid 



ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 



85 



the use of hot soup. I told him provision had already been made for 
that. 

I shall not attempt to interpret the meaning of the Word of Wis- 
dom, for to me it is clear, but may I call your attention to statements 
made by others by way of comparison. Hyrum Smith, brother of the 
Prophet, delivered a sermon on "The Word of Wisdom," soon after 
this revelation was received by Joseph Smith. In this sermon the 
Patriarch of the Church, who was sustained with Joseph Smith as a 
prophet, seer, and revelator, warned the Church against the use of tea 
and coffee, which he said were injurious to the mind and body. 

It is interesting to note that scientists and medical men have 
given more thought to and have conducted a more extensive research 
into the field of foods and food values during the last fifty years than 
during all the history of the world before, and that the results of their 
research harmonize with the Word of Wisdom. 

Recent medical publications make the following statement: 

"Coffee and tea do more harm than good. Caffene and tannic acid are the 
harmful agents in these beverages. Children should not have coffee or tea. 
Tea retards digestion." "Extremes of cold and heat produce gastric catarrh." 
"Piping hot broth or coffee is grateful on a cold day, so is ice-cream on a 
hot day, but extreme hot temperatures in the stomach are detrimental. Food 
repeatedly taken too hot or too cold may give rise to disturbances. Too hot 
food may be the cause of stomach disease. Note the frequency of ulcers among 
cooks. This may be due to the fact that they are constantly tasting hot things 
which they are cooking. 'The excessive use of pepper and spices may cause 
irritation of the stomach and intestines. Mustard is used altogether too lavishly. 
Its real place is -for external rather than for internal use. It congests and 
blisters tough skin." 

Referring to that which is good for man, the Lord places first, 
wholesome herbs, which he "hath ordained for the constitution, nature, 
and use of man — every herb in the season thereof, and every fruit in 
the season thereof ; all these to be used with prudence and thanksgiving." 
These are called by the dieticians high residual foods, or fodder vege- 
tables. They are nourishing and give bulk to the stool. These foods 
are thus excellent for constipation. "Recent research suggests that 
in the colon is found the origin of many chronic ills and the untimely 
aging of the body. Fibrous herbs, fruits and vegetables help to correct 
these conditions. These foods also contain a great amount of the 
health-giving elements called vitamins. Scientists have discovered 
that vitamins, when kept, oxidize; the vitamin percentage, therefore, 
in canned foods, decreases directly with the age of the product. This 
food element when taken in sufficient quantity, prevents certain diseases." 
This may explain why the Lord advised that they be eaten in the 
season thereof. Again we read from the revelations, "Yea, flesh also 
of beasts and of the fowls of the air, I, the Lord, have ordained for the 
use of man with thanksgiving ; nevertheless they are to be used spar- 
ingly." The scientist says, "It is now proved that meat eating is not 
essential to health and strength. The fundamental constituent of meat is 
proteid or albumen. This is found abundantly in milk, eggs, beans, 
peas and lentils. Medical science definitely knows that meat diet is 



86 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



harmful and dangerous in the presence of a number of diseases." Dr. 
Herser, a man of international reputation has said, "That in all cases 
of chronic rheumatism, his main advice and treatment is, simply stop 
eating meat!" "If food, particularly meat, is improperly masticated, 
it may pass into the colon partly digested. In this stage it is excellent 
culture media for pathogenic bacteria." Many of the minor ills of 
daily life are due to abdominal bacterial activity in the alimentary tract." 

The Lord says, "All grain is ordained for the use of man * * * 
to be the staff of life." The modern scientist says, "Whole wheat bread 
is fast becoming the bread of choice," among those interested in 
health preservation. Unfortunately much of the whole wheat bread 
served is made with a liberal amount of white flour. Graham flour is 
composed of the carefully ground unbolted entire wheat kernel, and 
that contains all the constituents of the wheat. Every family would be 
healthier if whole wheat products were substituted for white flour. 
The promise to those who follow this instruction is that they "Shall 
receive health in their navel, and marrow to their bones ; and shall find 
wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures ; and 
shall run and not be weary, and shall walk and not faint;" and the 
Lord gives unto them a promise, "That the destroying angel shall pass 
by them." 

Is it not worth our while to become familiar with the Word of 
Wisdom and live according to its teachings, that we may enjoy these 
blessings which follow in a natural way, as do all of God's blessings, 
for they are based upon his laws and come to us as a reward of faith 
and obedience? 

I believe this revelation to be the word of God and given to us 
as a principle with promises and I am happy to so testify to you at this 
time. 

May I ask that you pardon a personal incident. The other day 
we were assembling a number of pictures to send to Europe. We had 
a number ready for distribution. In making the selection, I stated, 
that we had one of the Prophet but did not have one of grandfather. 
Just a few moments before a prominent brother had entered the office 
and heard the preceding remarks. He interrupted by saying, "I have 
never before heard Hyrum Smith spoken of in that way." I asked 
what seemed to be wrong with the statement. "Well," said he, "I 
guess it's all right but it sounded a little strange to me." When he left 
his words remained with me. What right had I to speak of Hyrum 
Smith in that apparently familiar way ? Although a grandson by birth, 
I had not known him in life. Had I assumed a manner of self- 
exaltation? My answer is, that from my early childhood I have been 
taught and encouraged to pray to an all-wise and merciful Personage, 
who dwells in heaven. That this Personage, in whose image I have 
been created, is my Heavenly Father. That he is good, kind, merciful 
and loving and that when necessary he will chastise his children. That 
we are to acknowledge his hand in all things and he will hear and answer 
our prayers when we approach him in faith not wavering. 



ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 



87 



I have not seen God but I have felt the power of his Spirit as I 
have approached him in prayer, and never yet has he failed to comfort 
me. 

Through the teachings and example of my father, Joseph F. Smith, 
I discovered in the life and labors of his father, Hyrum Smith, those 
attributes which are God-given and which have become a very part of 
all those who hope to gain an exaltation in the celestial kingdom. It 
has not been difficult for me to have faith in God and I have learned 
to look upon Hyrum Smith, whom I am permitted to call grandfather, 
as one of God's noble men — one who has gone back to his presence. 
As a boy I had very little opportunity to really know my father, but the 
last years of his life I was almost his constant companion. He was a 
man of God, full of the spirit of love. His life was filled with righteous- 
ness and although his words and example are constantly before me 
I find that I have been left an heritage difficult to carry. If I have 
failed, it is not because of lack of faith in God or in his promises to his 
children, but because of my inability to climb even part way to the 
heights to which they have attained. In my soul I know that God 
lives and does hear and answer prayers. I know that Joseph and 
Hyrum Smith were prophets of God, that Joseph F. Smith walked in 
their footsteps. Their lives have been an example and a source of 
inspiration to me which has helped me to a better understanding of God 
and his purposes. And while I may have fallen far short with such 
examples to encourage me I have always felt in my soul to do the 
will of my Father which is in heaven and so live that I may at last be 
worthy of an exaltation in the celestial kingdom where I know their 
exaltation will be. 

To me the only thing in life worth while is to obtain that goal. If 
I should fail then what is life? Nothing. For the purpose of our 
existence in the earth is an exaltation in the celestial kingdom of our 
Heavenly Father, and I know that the only way that may be is through 
faithful service rendered in obedience to his laws. I rejoice that I 
can, in my very soul, testify of these things. May the blessings of the 
Lord continue to rest upon us and help us to carry on his great purposes 
in the earth I humbly ask in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

You may not be aware of the fact that for some time — I think 
it is about thirty weeks — at four o'clock every Monday afternoon, the 
Tabernacle Choir and the Organ are broadcasting throughout most of 
the United States. This is being done by means of the largest and 
most powerful radio stations to be found in the country. These broad- 
casts go to New York, Washington, Baltimore, Atlanta, Pittsburgh, 
Chicago, Toronto, Kansas City, St. Paul, Minneapolis, St. Louis, 
Cincinnati, Denver, Portland, Oakland, San Francisco, and other cities ; 
and it is estimated that more than eight million people hear them. 

We would be pleased to hear from another speaker this afternoon, 
but time will not permit. By the time we have heard the closing anthem 



88 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



and the benediction it will be necessary for this body of people to with- 
draw, unless they would like to remain here and listen to the broadcast. 
If you stay we request that you be very quiet. There must be no 
whispering. Ordinarily, when this broadcast is going on, no one except 
the choir is allowed in the building. If someone has to cough we hope 
that he will smother it as best he can by the use of a handkerchief. 

As I look upon this audience I am impressed with the wonderful 
fulfilment of the prediction of Joseph Smith which was delivered on the 
west side of the Mississippi river and recorded in the journal of Brother 
Anson Call : 

"I prophesy that the saints will continue to suffer much affliction, and will 
be driven to the Rocky Mountains ; many will apostatize, others will be put to 
death by our persecutors, or lose their lives in consequence of exposure or 
disease; and some will live to go and assist in making settlements, and build 
cities, and see the Saints become a mighty people in the midst of the Rocky 
Mountains." 

What a mighty people we are ! As I look upon this audience today 
and think of the wonderful audiences that we had at all our meetings 
yesterday, and when I think of the seven hundred thousand people who 
are now members of the Church, I rejoice in the fulfilment of this 
prediction by Joseph Smith. 

Daniel Webster, acknowledged to be one of the greatest, and claimed 
by some to be the very greatest, of all our senators in his day, referring 
to this country where the Prophet of the Lord said we should become 
a great and a mighty people, made the remark : 

"What do we want with this vast, worthless area? This region of savages and 
wild beasts, of deserts, of shifting sands and whirlwinds of dust, of cactus and 
prairie dogs? To what use could we ever hope to put those great deserts or 
those endless mountain ranges, impenetrable and covered to their very base 
with eternal snow? What can we ever hope to do with the western coast of 
three thousand miles, rock-bound, cheerless, uninviting, and not a harbor on it? 
Mr. President, I will never vote one cent from the public treasury to place the 
Pacific Coast one inch nearer Boston than it now is." 

"Shout ye hosanna," an anthem, was sung by the choir, solo part 
by Bob Robinson. 

The benediction was pronounced by Elder James W. Funk, Pres- 
ident of the Benson Stake of Zion. 

Conference adjourned until Tuesday morning, April 8th, at 10:00. 



THIRD DAY 
MORNING MEETING 

The fifth session of the conference commenced promptly at 10:00 
a. m., Tuesday, April 8th, with President Heber J. Grant presiding. 

The music for this session was furnished by the Latter-day Saints 
College Festival Chorus, Elder George H. Durham, conductor. 

The chorus and congregation sang the hymn, "O ye mountains 
high." 

Elder Edward H. Snow offered the invocation. 

The chorus sang the anthem, "Arise, shine, for the light has come." 

ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 

I feel, my brethren and sisters, that I need your faith and help this 
morning, and the guidance of the Spirit of the Lord. I have no set 
theme to present to you, but if I may be led by the spirit of truth I 
desire to bear witness of the truth and re-affirm before you my faith. 

REAFFIRMATION OF FAITH 

I believe in God the Father and in his Son Jesus Christ and in 
the Holy Ghost. I believe, without any reservation, that Jesus Christ 
is the Son- of God and the Redeemer of the world. I believe that 
through the shedding of his blood he brought redemption to this earth 
and to all things upon its face, and, through obedience to the Gospel 
he has given unto all men the privilege of the remission of their sins ; 
for he has suffered for all, that they might not suffer if they will repent. 
I believe that through obedience to the Gospel all who believe on his 
name and endure in faith to the end shall be saved in the celestial 
kingdom in the presence of the Father and the Son. 

I believe it is the purpose of the Father to bring to pass the 
redemption of all men from death and from hell, except those who 
turn away from the light and the truth after having received it, thus 
becoming sons of perdition. I believe that our Father has prepared 
a place for every man according to his works and worthiness, but 
only through obedience to his laws in their fulness will men come back 
into the presence of the Father and the Son to receive an exaltation as 
sons and joint heirs with Jesus Christ. 

I believe sincerely and absolutely in the mission of the Prophet 
Joseph Smith. I have faith, yes, the knowledge, that he was called of 
God and is a prophet and that he stands at the head of this great 
Dispensation of the Fulness of Times. I believe he was chosen to 
this mission before the foundation of the world was laid, and that 
he filled it acceptably before the Lord, in diligence and faith, in 
the midst of constant persecution. He was called to give to the 



90 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



world the light and fulness of the Gospel that through it men might 
be saved and come back into the kingdom of God. 

GRATEFUL FOR VISIONS OF THE PROPHET 

I am very grateful for the first vision, in which the Father and the 
Son appeared to the youthful prophet and again restored to man the 
true knowledge of God. I am grateful for the coming of Moroni, 
revealing the everlasting Gospel, and making known again to the world 
the fact that God is the same yesterday, today and forever; that the 
heavens are not sealed and God will and does inspire men in this age 
and generation as well as he did in times of old. I believe that the 
people upon the earth today are just as precious in the sight of the 
Lord as were the people who lived anciently, and just as much entitled 
to guidance as they who lived in former times, when the Lord revealed 
himself to them in person and through his prophets. I believe that 
the reason the Lord has not revealed himself to man in the ages that 
are past, when the Gospel was not on the earth, is that man rejected 
him and refused to be guided by his divine truth. 

GRATEFUL FOR RESTORATION OF KEYS OF AUTHORITY 

I am grateful for the coming of Peter, James and John, and, 
preceding them, John the Baptist, to restore the priesthood of God, 
that authority might be on the earth through which men receive re- 
mission of their sins and may come back into the kingdom through 
their faithfulness. I am exceedingly thankful for the Church and that 
again the Lord has established in the earth the same organization which 
existed primitively and which was taken from the earth because of the 
wickedness of men, and not, as I have said, because God willed it ; not 
because he has shown favoritism, but because the people themselves 
refused to hear the prophets and turned from the truth. 

I am very grateful for the coming of Moses, Elias and Elijah, 
restoring further keys, and in fact for the coming of all the prophets 
from the days of Adam to the time of Peter, James and John. For 
by these prophets the keys of all the dispensations past have [been 
restored in this Dispensation of the Fulness of Times, that the work 
of the Lord might be made complete according to the promies made 
by our Lord and by his servants. Paul has said the Lord purposed 
in himself "that in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might 
gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, 
and which are on earth." 

I am very grateful for the temples; for the sealing power which 
Elijah restored to Joseph Smith, which made it possible for the family 
to be preserved as a unit forever, husbands and wives having claim 
upon each other, and children having claim on their parents, through 
obedience to the ordinances of the temple of the Lord. I am grateful 
that the knowledge has been revealed and the authority given for the 
redemption of the dead who have died without a knowledge of the 
Gospel, but who would have received it had that opportunity come ; in 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 91 



fact, for all the ordinances of the house of the Lord by which the fulness 
of salvation comes. 

THANKFUL FOR NEW WITNESSES 

I am thankful for the great volume of scripture which has been 
revealed, restoring to the Hebrew scriptures many of the most plain 
and precious parts that were taken away through the wickedness and 
unbelief of the world. I am thankful for the witnesses the Lord 
raised up who have testified in this dispensation that God lives, for 
they saw him and conversed with him and with his holy angels. 
Above all, I am most grateful for the testimony of the truth which I 
have received myself that all these things are true. 

BORN OF GOODLY PARENTS 

I am grateful that I have been born of goodly parents who taught 
me to walk in the light of the truth. From my earliest recollection, from 
the time I first could read, I have received more pleasure and greater 
satisfaction out of the study of the scriptures, and reading of the Lord 
Jesus Christ, and of the Prophet Joseph Smith, and the work that has 
been accomplished for the salvation of men, than from anything else in 
all the world. The Lord has given me a testimony of the truth which 
I pray may abide with me forever. I know that Joseph Smith was and 
is a prophet of the living God, and that he holds the keys of this 
dispensation. More than this — and I hope I may be pardoned for 
the references I am about to make — I am grateful for my lineage. I 
am very thankful to my Father in heaven that I am the son of my 
Father and the son of my grandfather. May I say to you that I am not 
boasting, but I am speaking, I hope and fully believe, in the spirit of 
humility in saying this. I cannot express my gratitude fully that my 
father remained faithful and obedient to the Gospel and the Church 
all his days, and that he taught his children to love the truth and to 
be loyal to the message delivered through the Prophet Joseph Smith, 
and to honor the name they bear. Let me say something which I think 
is not generally known. 

HYRU'M SMITH HELD KEYS JOINTLY WITH THE PROPHET JOSEPH 

My grandfather, the Patriarch Hyrum Smith, was called to hold 
the keys of this dispensation jointly with the Prophet Joseph, his younger 
brother. The Lord has said that in the mouths of two witnesses shall 
all things be established. When the Jews accused our Lord of not 
fulfilling the law, because he stood alone and had no witness to speak 
for him and testify to the divine nature of his mission, he answered 
them: 

"Ye judge after the flesh ; I judge no man. 

"And yet if I judge, my judgment is true : for I am not alone, but I and 
the Father that sent me. 

"It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true. 

"I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth 
witness of me." 



92 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Joseph Smith could not have stood alone, else his work would 
have failed, just as the work of the Savior required the confirmation of 
another witness, and who could testify for Christ other than his Father ? 
And so the Lord called another man to stand with Joseph Smith and 
to hold the keys of salvation in this dispensation as a witness with him. 
The Prophet Joseph was alone in his first vision. He was alone when 
the Angel Moroni first came to him and revealed the Book of Mormon, 
but whenever keys were to be bestowed ; when the Lord had light and 
information to reveal in which the power of priesthood was to play a 
part, Joseph Smith and one other witness received the blessings. 

OLIVER COWDEEY'S APPOINTMENT 

It was Oliver Cowdery who was appointed to stand with Joseph 
Smith to hold the keys of this dispensation. It was Oliver Cowdery 
who, with Joseph Smith, received the priesthood of Aaron under the 
hands of John the Baptist. It was Oliver Cowdery who received the 
authority of the Melchizedek Priesthood with Joseph Smith from 
Peter, James and John. It was Oliver Cowdery who knelt with the 
Prophet Joseph in the Kirtland temple in 1836, when Moses and Elias 
and Elijah came with the keys of their dispensations. I am convinced 
that if we had the full record, we would discover that Oliver Cowdery 
was associated with Joseph Smith the Prophet when the keys of all 
the other dispensations were revealed and restored in this dispensation. 
In this manner Oliver Cowdery was appointed and ordained to stand 
with the Prophet Joseph Smith as an associate and witness, holding 
all the authority and keys of this most glorious of all dispensations — the 
Dispensation of the Fulness of Times. 

KEYS OF POWER AND AUTHORITY TAKEN FROM OLIVER 

Unfortunately — at least unfortunately for Oliver Cowdery, who 
was called to this wonderful and responsible position, jointly associated 
with Joseph Smith holding all the authority and presidency in this 
dispensation — Oliver, in a spirit of rebellion and darkness, turned away. 
He lost his fellowship in the Church, the power of the priesthood 
was taken from him, and for a season he stood excommunicated from 
the Church. Fortunately he eventually overcame this spirit of darkness 
and humbly came back and received his membership in the Church, 
but never again was he privileged to receive the keys of power and 
authority which once were placed upon him. 

ANOTHER WITNESS CHOSEN 

That this testimony of witnesses might be continued and made 
complete, the Lord chose another to take the place of Oliver Cowdery, 
and that other witness was the Patriarch Hyrum Smith. By revelation 
through Joseph Smith, Hyrum was called and ordained to the priesthood 
and standing once held by Oliver Cowdery. Hyrum Smith received 
a double portion, not only was he called to become the Patriarch of the 
Church, which was his birthright, but at the same time the Lord said 
to him: 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 93 



"And from this time forth I appoint unto him that he may be a prophet, 
and a seer, and a revelator unto my church, as well as my servant Joseph; 

"That he may act in concert also with my servant Joseph ; and that he 
shall receive counsel from my servant Joseph, who shall show unto him the 
keys, whereby he may ask and receive, and be crowned with the same blessing, 
and glory, and honor, and priesthood, and gifts of the priesthood, that once 
were put upon him that was my servant Oliver Cowdery ; 

"That my servant Hyrum may bear record of the things which I shall 
show unto him, that his name may be had in honorable remembrance from 
generation to generation, forever and ever." 

In accord with this calling and commandment, the Prophet Joseph 
Smith conferred upon Hyrum Smith all the keys, authority and gifts 
of the priesthood which he, the Prophet, held, and which were formerly 
held by Oliver Cowdery. The Lord also revealed to Hyrum Smith 
all that was necessary to make him completely and to the full degree, a 
witness with his brother Joseph, as a prophet, seer, revelator and 
president of the Church, and to stand through all time and all eternity 
at the head of this dispensation with his brother Joseph, a witness for 
Jesus Christ. 

JOINT MARTYRS 

Thus, we see, Hyrum Smith became a president of the Church with 
Joseph Smith, which place Oliver Cowdery might have held had he 
not wavered and fallen from his exalted station. I am firmly of the 
opinion that had Oliver Cowdery remained true to his covenants 
and obligations as a witness with Joseph Smith, and retained his au- 
thority and place, he, and not Hyrum Smith, would have gone with 
Joseph Smith as a prisoner and to martyrdom at Carthage. 

The sealing of the testimony through the shedding of blood would 
not have been complete in the death of the Prophet Joseph Smith alone ; 
it required the death of Hyrum Smith who jointly held the keys of this 
dispensation. It was needful that these martyrs seal their testimony 
with their blood, that they "might be honored and the wicked might 
be condemned." 

Joseph's opinion of his brother 

Now if I may take just a moment or two longer — there are many 
things I would like to say, but time forbids — I would like to read to 
you the opinion of the Prophet expressed of his brother Hytrum, 
who was almost six years older. This is what the Prophet says': 

"Brother Hyrum, what a faithful heart you have got! Oh may the Eternal 
Jehovah crown eternal blessings upon your head, as a reward for the care you 
have had for my soul ! O how many are the sorrows we have shared together ; 
and again we find ourselves shackled with the unrelenting hand of oppression. 
Hyrum, thy name shall be written in the book of the Law of the Lord, for 
those who come after thee to look upon, that they may pattern after thy works." 

On another occasion the Prophet said: 

"I could pray in my heart that all my brethren were like unto my beloved 
brother Hyrum, who possesses the mildness of a lamb, and the integrity of a 
Job, and in short, the meekness and humility of Christ; and I love him with 



94 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



that love that is stronger than death, for I never had occasion to rebuke him, 
nor he me, which he declared when he left me today." 

THE CHILDREN OF THE PROPHET 

All my life I have prayed and hoped that the Lord would touch 
the hearts of the children of the Prophet Joseph Smith and bring them 
to repentance. I still pray that he may do so. No man would hold 
out the hand of fellowship more quickly than I would to welcome them 
into the fold of truth. But I cannot countenance their actions in oppo- 
sition to this great work which the Lord established through the 
Prophet Joseph Smith. While I regret the fact that they stand aloof 
and in opposition to the fulness of the Gospel which that Prophet 
restored, yet I pray and hope that the time will speedily come when 
some of them, at least, will see the error of their ways, and come humbly 
seeking the favor of God, and membership in the Church. They who 
will not repent, but who persist in the opposition to the truth, may they 
be confounded ; may that which they propose come to nought ; may all 
their works fail and may they soon stand exposed in the full error 
of their ways before the world. 

May the Lord bless the family of the Prophet Joseph Smith and 
bring them to repentance. May he bless the descendants of Hyrum 
Smith that they also may walk in the light of the everlasting Gospel. 
May they never falter nor turn from the path in which their father 
walked, and may they honor and uphold his good name. And so I 
pray for all who receive the Gospel, for we are all brothers and sisters. 
May 'the Lord guide and bless all who love the truth. May we who 
have received the Gospel always stand steadfast, turning neither to 
the right nor to the left in the serving of the Lord, I pray, in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE 

The dominant feeling in my heart, my soul, is and has been, 
throughout this conference, so far as it has advanced, and will be, I 
trust, to the end and thence onward, one of surpassing gratitude, thanks- 
giving and praise, combined with a deep consciousness of humility. I 
think I have never felt more truly humble in my life than during the 
proceedings of this great conference. I prize my membership in the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints beyond all else on earth. 
It is sufficient to me to be a member of the Church, and in that great 
estate, I feel reverently humble. With you I have felt the power of the 
Spirit of God in these gatherings. This centenary is being celebrated 
by other than those whom we see with our physical eyes. There are 
more here than you see — messengers, reporters, spirits of high degree, 
who have been sent to take part with us in the commemoration of this 
wonderful century now brought to a close. 

"MORMONISM" A NEW . LIGHT 

The world may well ask what has this system called "Mormonism" 



ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE 



95 



given to mankind more than the world had before? At this major 
milepost in the course of the history of the Church it is natural that 
we indulge in retrospect, and I think a hundred years is a span of 
sufficient length to give us a fair perspective of that which lies behind 
us. IWe are able to see and interpret now, more clearly than was 
possible while the events were in progress, those great developments 
that followed each other in orderly succession, many of them fraught 
with suffering and witnessed by blood and tears. 

The world calls this religion "Mormonism;" so let it be; we shall 
use the term, it's convenient. We are always on our guard against the 
possible misapprehension attending its use, but we may use it safely. 
"Mormonism" has taught those who would be taught, those who would 
hear, all in the world who would listen, new conceptions concerning 
God. Is that not a gift worth prizing? I feel that through its influences 
I have come to know God better than would have been possible otherwise, 
even though I had the learning of the sages, the power of the orator 
and the voice of an angel. The revelation of this century past has 
thrown its light, like that of a great torch, into many of the dark 
passages of olden construction. "Mormonism," as I view it, is at once 
a system of the strictest fundamentalism coupled with all that is rational 
and good in the broadest modernism of the day. It has confirmed the 
declarations of ancient writ that the God we worship is a God of justice, 
but it has defined unto us in a way that man had never learned to 
know before, what kind of justice is God's justice. It has banished the 
stern tyrant upon his throne, sending one to heaven and ten to hell, 
all for his glory, and has shown that God's justice is just as truly the 
embodiment of mercy as it is the demand for right and righteousness. 

CONDEMNATION, SALVATION, EXALTATION 

It has taught me that the God I worship is the personification of 
love, but not that maudlin love that oftimes blinds our eyes to facts and 
leads us to inconsistent actions. Not one whit of the ancient gospel 
has been abated, but new meaning has been shown through the words 
of his prophets in these latter times, down to this very day. The 
ancient edict stands, as voiced by the Lord Christ to the eleven im- 
mediately before the departure of the Savior : "He that believeth and 
is baptized shall be saved, and he that believeth not shall be damned." 
That last word is an awful one. If we do not understand its true 
import, it is terrifying, and that very affirmation, declaration, law, 
has been restated in this day and age; but thanks be to the Lord of 
Hosts, he has given us to understand what he means by damnation. It 
is no less real than it ever was, but men have not always understood it 
aright. What is it to be damned? Does it mean that all who come 
under that sentence shall be cast into hell, there to dwell forever and 
forever? The light of the century, given by the Lord, declares the 
falsity of that construction. 

GRADATIONS IN THE HEREAFTER 

Salvation is graded ever upward until it culminates in the glorious 



96 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

condition of exaltation. Though the term salvation is used in scripture 
in a general way, and we must learn to discriminate between salvation 
and exaltation as we read, so damnation is graded ; else what did the 
Lord mean as recorded in the twelfth chapter of Mark, when he spoke 
of the leaders of the people who were untrue to their trust, when he 
spoke of those who used their power and position to oppress and to 
work evil ; when he said of such : "These shall receive greater dam- 
nation ?" Well, if there be a greater damnation there are lesser degrees 
of damnation and the term is used in the sense of deprivation and 
forfeiture. That man enters into a degree of damnation who has for- 
feited his opportunities and therefore has rendered himself incapable 
of the advancement that would otherwise be possible. 

The Lord has told us of places prepared for those entitled to sal- 
vation. He has told us that those who will keep all the laws and com- 
mandments of God can come where he is and shall be heirs of celestial 
glory and power. And he has told us of lesser degrees unto which 
others who have failed to rise to the occasion of laying hold on the 
blessing of eternal life, in its fulness, shall come ; and concerning the 
last of these kingdoms of glories, known to us as the Telestial, the 
Lord has said that it excels all that the human mind can conceive in 
glory, and yet the one in the Telestial Kingdom is condemned so far 
as his actions have rendered him incapable of attaining to the higher 
glories and blessings which mean power and advancement. 

LAW, NOT CAPRICE, IN DIVINE ADMINISTRATION 

"Mormonism" has taught me that God holds himself accountable to 
law even as he expects us to do. He has set us the example in obedience 
to law. I know that to say this would have been heresy a few decades 
ago. But we have the divine word for it: "I, the Lord, am bound 
when ye do what I say; but when ye do not what I say, ye have no 
promise." (Doc. and Cov. 82:10.) He operates by law and not by 
arbitrariness or caprice. He is no tyrant to be propitiated and placated 
by honeyed words. He cannot be moved by wordy oratory. He is 
not a judge sitting to be influenced by the specious pleas of crafty 
advocates ; and yet there is an eloquence that moves him ; there is a 
plea that influences him. The eloquence of prayer from a broken heart 
and a contrite spirit prevails with him. 

"Mormonism" has eliminated the thought of irregularity, caprice 
or favor from the doings and dealings of God with his children. He will 
take all circumstances into account and will give unto every man that 
which is his. Well, one may say, if that be the orderly procedure, 
natural and inevitable, what need of a judge to pronounce sentence? 
What need of a God? Great need indeed, for he has provided these 
conditions, these places, these certainties. He has made possible salva- 
tion and exaltation. The more we learn of God and his attributes, the 
wiser are we, not only for time but for eternity. God has revealed 
himself in this day with a literalness that puts beyond all question the 
fact of his goodness and Godliness. He has gone so far as to make 
plain unto us that he is no respecter of persons, and that while he has 



ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE 



97 



a covenant people upon the earth, others shall come from the east and 
from the west and from the north and from the south and shall enter 
into the kingdom of God if they will only do what he requires of them 
as conditions necessary for that enfranchisement. The conditions of 
citizenship in the kingdom of God are fair and just and open unto all 
men : "We believe that through the atonement of Christ all mankind 
may be saved by obedience to the. laws and ordinances of the Gospel." 
And except for those few, to whom reference has been made this morn- 
ing, who have betrayed their trust and who have forfeited the very 
ability to repent — and they are few — every soul that has ever been 
tabernacled in flesh upon the earth shall be redeemed and shall be 
saved in his degree of worthiness and desert. 

HELL HATH BOTH ENTRANCE AND EXIT 

During this hundred years many other great truths not known 
before, have been declared to the people, and one of the greatest is that 
to hell there is an exit as well as an entrance. Hell is no place to which 
a vindictive judge sends prisoners to suffer and to be punished princi- 
pally for his glory; but it is a place prepared for the teaching, the 
disciplining of those who failed to learn here upon the earth what they 
should have learned. True, we read of everlasting punishment, un- 
ending suffering, eternal damnation. That is a direful expression; but 
in his mercy the Lord has made plain what those words mean. "Eternal 
punishment," he says, is God's punishment, for he is eternal; and that 
condition or state or possibility will ever exist for the sinner who de- 
serves and really needs such condemnation ; but this does not mean that 
the individual sufferer or sinner is to be eternally and everlastingly made 
to endure and suffer. No man will be kept in hell longer than is 
necessary to bring him to a fitness for something better. When he 
reaches that stage the prison doors will open and there will be rejoicing 
among the hosts who welcome him into a better state. The Lord has 
not abated in the least what he has said in earlier dispensations con- 
cerning the operation of his law and his gospel, but he has made clear 
unto us his goodness and mercy- through it all, for it is his glory and 
his work to bring about the immortality and eternal life of man. 

THE LORD IS PLEASED WITH HIS CHURCH 

With such profound truths made plain to us in the course of these 
hundred years what may we not hope for confidently, trustfully, in 
the future? With all my heart I praise the God of hosts who has 
brought this Church to its present state. He is well pleased with it, 
speaking of the Church collectively, but not individually, for there are 
too many of us who are not living up to the fulness of his requirements ; 
but the Lord is pleased with his Church. He has endowed it with 
blessings beyond our power to compute or describe and there are yet 
greater blessings awaiting us, which shall be given to lead us onward 
and upward if we will, and with us all men who will become of us, all 
the honest in heart everywhere, unto a fulness of joy and glory; 



98

and that means no mere adulation, or demonstration of external splendor, 
but power and influence for good throughout eternity. 

May we individually be acceptable unto the Lord even as his 
Church is acceptable, I humbly pray, in the name -of Jesus, the Master, 
our Redeemer. Amen.

ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN 

Of the First Council of Seventy and President of the 
California Mission 

I sincerely pray, my brethren and sisters, that during the brief 
time I occupy in this conference meeting I may be under the direction 
of the Spirit of the Lord, for that Spirit can take of the things of God 
and make them clear to the understanding of us, his children. 

I praise the Lord for the precious things that have been presented 
for our consideration in this great centennial conference that is being 
held. We should all praise God for the splendid truths that have been 
brought to our attention. We must all know and feel that our Father 
in heaven is mindful of his work, his people, and his servants who 
direct his work. We can feel sure that his work and his will, by the 
power of the Holy Spirit, are being brought to the attention of those 
who have entered into covenant with God and have received, in this 
great dispensation, the glorious Gospel given for the salvation of the 
children of God. 

I have come in contact, during the past few days, with a goodly 
number of missionaries, particularly missionaries who are laboring with 
me in the California Mission, and have heard from them many expres- 
sions of gratitude for the blessings that have come to them as repre- 
sentatives of the work of God, in the preaching of the Gospel 'they 
have been commissioned to teach. Ofttimes I have heard declarations 
from them indicating that they have received in a fulness the fulfilment 
of the promises that were conferred upon them when they were set 
apart and sent out to be ambassadors of the Lord Jesus Christ in the 
preaching of his restored Gospel. Those promises have been mar- 
velously fulfilled. I feel that I too can testify, as my companions 
frequently testify, that the promises made to me have had complete 
fulfilment. 

A few years ago I was sent to labor in the California Mission. 
President Heber J. Grant pronounced blessings upon my head that 
seemed to me to be too great for realization. I had labored for many 
years in other missions, particularly in the European missions, and 
entertained the thought that is common to missionaries that the field 
where I had labored was the greatest field in the world. The European 
Mission, to me in those days of my young manhood, was the mission 



ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN 



99 



of missions, and when there were promises made to me on the eve of my 
going to California — which at that time seemed to me a very insig- 
nificant mission when compared with the great fields where I had 
formerly operated — I could not believe that there could possibly come 
blessings that would surpass my former experiences. I feel "to humbly 
acknowledge and testify before this great congregation that the promises, 
wonderful as they were, have been fulfilled, yea, more than fulfilled. 

It has been my pleasure in the California Mission to be in the 
companionship of a splendid company of missionaries, young men and 
young women, who have been anxious to meet the responsibilities 
resting upon them as representatives of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints. They have manifested the very greatest consider- 
ation and deference for me ; they have gladly hearkened to my counsel ; 
they have fully and joyfully held up my hands, and by their attitude 
have made me feel that I could depend upon their help, and that I had 
their faith and prayers and confidence. There are in the mission a very 
large number of local people who are not converts that have been made 
in the mission, but people who have been in the Church from their birth. 
We have ten thousand five hundred members enrolled in the California 
Mission. The majority are men and women who have been born and 
reared in the Church. They have been anxious to have the same 
advantages in the way of buildings in which to serve the Lord, that they 
were accustomed to in other sections of the land where they resided 
before they took up residence in California. Because of this, there has 
been a great desire manifest to erect houses of worship throughout the 
California Mission. It has been my pleasure to see comfortable chapels 
dot the land from Elko, Nevada, across over the Sierra Nevada Moun- 
tains into the Sacramento valley in California ; then down through the 
Sacramento valley, and the San Joaquin valley, to the southern part of 
the state, at San Diego ; and then beyond the California line down 
through Arizo.na. Until six hundred and fifty thousand dollars worth 
of chapels have been erected in the California Mission, in which the 
people now worship the Lord our God. That surely is a blessing that 
is far beyond anything that was pronounced upon my head. 

Then I have seen five or six thousand people, young and old, 
yield obedience to the doctrines of the Gospel. They have gone down 
into the waters of baptism and have entered into covenant with the 
Lord to serve him and keep his commandments. We read in the revela- 
tions of God that if a man gives his lifetime to the preaching of the 
Gospel and saves but one soul how great will his joy be with that 
soul in the kingdom of God. I feel again the blessings that have been 
realized have been greater than the promises that were made, and have 
found in the California Mission every opportunity for the service of 
God and every reward that I ever found in the European Mission or 
elsewhere. I have had, according to the promise sealed upon my head, 
a marvelous and wonderful experience, and feel in my soul that I know 
that I have been richly and wonderfully blessed in laboring in the service 
of God for the spreading of those doctrines that constitute the Gospel 
of the Lord Jesus Christ. That Gospel is today, as it was anciently, 



100 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



the power of God unto salvation. All this and more has come to me in 
the California Mission. 

After one hundred years of teaching the truth brought back to 
earth through the ministry of the great prophet of the Dispensation of 
the Fulness of Times, we should all be coming to a realization of the 
wonderful nature of the work made manifest to men in the age in which 
we now live. It is strange to those who have received the truth, that 
all good men cannot see the beauty and necessity of the marvelous work 
that has come to mankind through the prophet of God, Joseph Smith. 

I shall read a few words. I do not know the author, but they are 
words that have been sent out in the interest of the Mutual Improvement 
work of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and they fit in, 
I feel, remarkably well with the service missionaries render in the 
preaching of the Gospel as it is now being proclaimed. 

"In the first century, due to the teachings of Jesus Christ and his apostles, 
there was a perfect understanding that God the Father and his Son Jesus 
Christ and the Holy Ghost, were separate, distinct, personages. The Savior 
was in the express image of his Father, possessing a tangible body of flesh and 
bones. Jesus taught that his father was greater than he and he was subject to 
the Father. Paul, in his epistles to the saints, almost invariably bore witness to 
the distinct and separate personalities of the Father and the Son. In the year 
1830 these truths had been lost and the knowledge of God had become a great 
mystery; the personages of the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost in the 
minds of the people were confused and they declared God to be without bodily 
form and passions. 

"Through the great prophet, who was the instrument in the hands of God 
in reestablishing the work of God and receiving the visits of the angel who was 
sent flying through the midst of heaven having the everlasting Gospel to preach 
to those who dwell upon the earth, the truth as it was comprehended and taught 
by the inspired apostles of old, was again made known. 

"The ancient prophets, as well as the Apostles of old, declared that revelation 
was to be had by the people of God in all ages. Many of the prophets had 
predicted wonderful revelations and renewal of covenants between the Lord and 
his people in the latter days. In the year 1830 all this was 'denied, and the 
world taught that the canon of scriptures was full and closed forever. 

"The prophets of old predicted the coming of messengers from the presence 
of the Lord in the latter days, to visit men and to bestow upon them keys of 
authority and to instruct them in the ways of the Lord. In the year 1830 it was 
generally believed that the. time of the appearing of angels from the presence 
of the Lord was past, and no longer needed. 

"The Lord established a Church and in the days of the Apostles it was 
officered by Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, Elders, Bishops, Priests, etc. Paul 
declared that these officers were necessary to the Church for its perfection. 
In the year 1830 all this had been changed and there were no Apostles, and no 
Prophets — no one to speak by divine authority. 

"Through the ministry of the great prophet of the latter times, we have 
been made acquainted with the glorious truth that our Father in heaven is 
the same yesterday, today and forever, that he changes not, and that his 
revelation, his direction, is had today among the children of men as it was 
had anciently. 

"In the scriptures man is called upon to repent, and serve the Lord by keeping 
his commandments. In many churches in 1830 it was taught that through his 
atonement Jesus Orist had done all for man and man could do nothing for 
himself towards his salvation. All that was required was that an individual 
confess Jesus Christ and he would be saved." 



ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN 



101 



We have learned in the age in which we live, by the revelations 
that have been given to the Prophet Joseph Smith, that we cannot 
take the commission that was given two thousand years ago to the 
disciples who were sent out to preach the Gospel, and claim that we 
have authority because of that commission, to teach the precious things 
of the kingdom of heaven. We preach today not because Jesus the 
Christ authorized men anciently to preach, but because of revelation and 
commandment directly to us. He made the declaration : "Ye have not 
chosen me, but I have chosen you and ordained you, that ye should 
go and bring forth fruit ;" and he commanded his disciples to go unto 
all nations, "Baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, 
and of the Holy Ghost ; teaching them to observe all things whatsoever 
I have commanded you ; and, lo, I am with you always, even unto the 
end of the world. 1 " 

If you will read the sixty-eighth section of the book of Doctrine 
and Covenants you will find that men operate today because the Lord 
God himself declared that his servants who had been clothed with 
authority in our own time were to go into all the world preaching the 
Gospel to every creature, making the promise anew that those who 
would believe them and be baptized would be saved, and those who 
would not believe should be damned. The authority has been con- 
ferred upon men in the age in which we live. I praise the name of my 
Maker, that in his loving kindness and providence, I myself, have been 
clothed with that precious authority, the authority of priesthood, the 
right to advocate the glorious doctrines that will bring men and women 
back into the presence of God, the right to administer those sacred and 
holy ordinances that have always been essential to salvation ; they were 
essential in the meridian of time; essential in the days of our father 
Adam and through all dispensations. There has never been any other 
means by which men and women might be made citizens of the kingdom 
of God, and never will be worlds without end. That authority has 
been conferred upon mortal men in this age in which we live. I 
would that I could burn that thought into the minds of men and women 
who have not given investigation to this glorious Gospel that by the 
providence of God has been brought back to mankind again ; for in 
our own time authority has again been given to men and the command- 
ment given by divine revelation in this dispensation that we shall go 
into all the world and preach the Gospel to every creature. We invite 
men and women who are not of our faith to give attention to this 
proclamation, this representation that the God of heaven has revealed 
anew the good old Gospel, the only Gospel that has the power of 
salvation ; and he has made the declaration that all people may know, 
if they will, by obedience, that his word and his truth have again been 
revealed, by which lost authority could be brought back to men. There 
was no other way, as some have been able to discern who have not 
been members of the Church. 

I will read a word or two from a booklet that I picked up long 
ago in an old cathedral in the old world. The pamphlet is entitled 



102 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



"Questions and Answers," and I read under the heading, "Why I am 
a Roman Catholic" : 

"And again, when Luther, Calvin, Henry VIII, and their followers were 
starting in their mad career, either the true religion was then in the world, 
or it was not. If it was, they committed grievous crimes in making new 
religions to oppose it. If it was not, they were powerless to create it. It takes 
a Christ, not a Luther, to create a Christianity. On either supposition, therefore, 
Protestantism is not the true religion of Jesus Christ." 

I wish men could comprehend the truth of that declaration. "It 
takes a Christ, not a Luther to create Christianity." 

So says a Roman Catholic. He seemed to recognize the truth — 
for it is the truth — that if the Gospel of the Son of God had disappeared 
from the earth, men could not bring it back. It could only be brought 
back by that Being who is the author of salvation, and in whom all 
power and authority center. The Catholic priest spoke better than 
he knew. We testify that the Lord God Almighty sent, as we have 
heard, at the opening of this dispensation, over a hundred years ago, 
his Son, our Redeemer, and holy angels ; and those angels conferred 
upon men once more the authority of the Lord Jesus Christ ; and by 
that authority men now minister in the nations of the world. If men 
are pricked in their hearts and cry out, "Men and brethren, what shall 
we do?" we make answer, "Repent, and be baptized, in the name of 
Jesus Christ, for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift 
of the Holy Ghost." That is the religion of Jesus Christ, also the 
religion called Mormonism ; it is the power of God unto salvation. 
God help us to understand it, to believe it, to receive it and live it, 
I humblv pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 

I thank God, my Heavenly Father, for this glorious occasion. My 
heart has been touched by the inspiration of the great messages which 
have come to us and by the contemplation of the century of achievement 
through which the Church has passed. 

I humbly invoke the blessings of the Lord upon the words which I 
shall utter, that they may be in some measure worthy. 

ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO 

The scene was set one hundred years ago. America was newer 
then than now. The Alleghanies were in the west. Illinois and Missouri 
were the extreme frontier. Roads were trails and communication was 
difficult. Life in the villages and even in the cities was highly provin- 
cial, as it ever must be without adequate transportation facilities. Ag- 
riculture was the chief occupation of the people. The machine age and 
industrial era had not yet come. The nation was in the making, very 
young — still an experiment. A union had been formed but not under- 
stood by all the contracting parties. It had not then been subjected to 



ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 103 



the terrible test of blood and battle through which its real birth came. 
Pioneering — the subjugation of the soil — was the vocation of the people. 
Religion and politics were their avocations. Education was very lim- 
ited. Lands must be reclaimed before schools and colleges can be 
built. But there were churches and creeds, and high partizanship and in- 
tense prejudices. Amusements were not so common as now. People 
were serious — very serious — and religion occupied much of their time 
and more of their thought. 

THE ORGANIZATION OF THE CHURCH PROJECTED 

Onto such a scene the organization of the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints was dramatically projected. It was not viewed 
with indifference as it might have been in the day of tolerance in which 
we live. The circumstances leading to it — the heavenly vision of the 
young prophet, the miraculous discovery and translation of the gold 
plates, the bestowal of divine authority — were a challenge to the profes- 
sors of religion which they could not and were not disposed to ignore. 
The circumstances undermined the fundamentals of their creeds. The 
vision revised the prevalent conception of the personality of God and 
the doctrine that revelation had closed ; the Book of Mormon upset 
existing archaeological theories and gave a new interpretation of the 
Gospel; and if divine authority had been conferred by heavenly mes- 
sengers, why then men theretofore had not held it. 

INTOLERANCE AND BITTERNESS ENCOUNTERED 

These things the religionists sensed, even if they did not express 
them. So they were not tolerant, they were not indifferent. They were 
aroused, they were resentful and with bitterness and persecution thev 
made the way of the young prophet and the new church hard indeed. We 
believe that the spirit of opposition was engendered by the adversary of 
light and truth. Even so it was surely intensified by a consciousness, 
though only partially understood, of the far-reaching effect of the new 
establishment on the creeds and institutions of the time. 

A NEW KINGDOM 

And the fears and apprehensions were well founded, although the 
bitterness and persecution were not. In no land other than America 
could the young Church have taken root sufficiently to stand. Even in 
the liberty of our country its early years were in great hazard. A new 
dispensation of the Gospel was ushered in, new interpretations were 
given irreconcilable with those being taught, and a new kingdom was 
set up, a kingdom that was spiritual in nature but one which so per- 
meated every fiber and tissue of living that it came to be construed by 
many as of temporal jurisdiction. So vital was this new kingdom to its 
adherents and so completely did it command their affection, their ener- 
gies and devotion, that those who came in contact with it and were 
not of it became violently jealous of its influence and its power. They 
saw the masterful leadership of its authorities ; they saw a man loved and 



104 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



revered as if he were indeed a prophet, they saw a unity and cohesion 
among the members incomparable to any they had known ; and they 
saw progress and achievement that strangely galled like wormwood 
their envious hearts. 

THAT WHICH PROMPTED OPPOSITION 

I have tried diligently and sincerely to discover the factors which 
prompted the bitter and violent opposition to the Church in its early 
rise, and I reach the conclusion from the recorded facts which I know 
that it is ascribable chiefly to simple, unadulterated jealousy of its superb 
cooperation, unity, and control, and a fear that such worthy qualities 
would make it unassailable and triumphant. I am sure that this has 
been so in politics and business. I believe it has been true in the eccle- 
siastical field. No other reason could well exist. The leaders taught 
only good principles and the acknowledged virtues. The Priesthood 
ruled by kindness and persuasion and not by force. The cooperative ob- 
jectives of the people were worthy. They were loyal citizens of the 
governments under which they lived, and their lives were unusually 
pure and upright. I grant that the doctrine of plural marriage contra- 
vened established custom, but the enmity came before the announce- 
ment of that doctrine and has long since survived the abandonment of 
its practice. I cannot find any instance where the Church, acting under 
official guidance, has ever brought to any person, community, state 
or nation anything but moral and civic righteousness, high idealism, 
and worthy accomplishment. 

When I speak of those who have violently opposed the establish- 
ment and work of the Church I mean to limit the number to those who 
have had contact with it and opportunity to observe its people and its 
ways. I do not include many thousands who have traduced us because 
they have never known us and have unconsciously been the victims of 
false and malignant reports. 

GROWTH IN SPITE OF OPPOSITION 

In spite of opposition the Church grew. Every year brought an in- 
crease; no year a decrease. It met successfully every difficulty. Ene- 
mies within and without could not stay it. It survived, not without un- 
speakable sorrow but without retardation, its severest calamity — the 
martyrdom of its president, prophet and revelator. It endured mob- 
bings, drivings, devastations, privations and inexpressible cruelties 
but it never faltered. It went on and on in its destined course until it is 
what you acclaim it today, your pride and mine, a benefactor to man- 
kind, and I think I may say with assurance a marvel in the eyes of 
thoughtful observers. 

THE CAUSE QF ITS GROWTH 

Why has it grown? Because it has ever had within it the seeds 
and essence of life. It is vital to its members and to the world. It so 
intimately touches every phase of living that it means everything or 



ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 105 



nothing. It is authoritative. The authority is real, not symbolic, to those 
who accept it. Its ordinances are efficacious and its faith is a living, 
moving faith founded on individual conviction and testimony, the wit- 
ness of the Divine Spirit to the spirit of man. 

Individual testimony brings a sense of personal responsibility. Every 
man who has received has felt a duty to give,, and that sense has 
prompted him to, respond to the direction of the priesthood. (We have 
been criticized because of our proclivities for proselyting. We would 
be untrue to the genius of our faith if we failed to share the gifts of 
the Gospel with others. So long as we conceive ourselves to be cus- 
todians of the truth we must disseminate it. I would like to pay tribute 
to those who have carried the message. 

THE OUTSTANDING ACCOMPLISHMENT 

Comparisons are odious. They are often erroneous and lead to 
difficulty, but if I were asked to name the outstanding, distinctive or- 
ganized accomplishment of the Church of Christ in the last century 1 
would, without much hesitation, set forth its phenomenal missionary 
labors and system. Nothing more truly characterizes the altruism 
of the Gospel that it teaches. Nothing more deeply signifies the devo- 
tion and. sincerity of its members. 

It would be interesting to know the number of missionaries who 
have been sent forth and the money value of their maintenance and time 
since the organization of the Church. These figures are not available 
in full detail, but from such investigation as I have been able to make 
I give you the following estimates. There have been approximately sixty 
thousand missionaries in the Church. The average length of a mission 
is twenty months, or six hundred days. Thirty-six million days of 
missionary service have been contributed at an average expense out- 
lay of one dollar per day. This money has been taken out of Latter- 
day Saint communities and spent away from home. If the reasonable 
value of a missionary's productive time may be set at three dollars per 
day there may be added to the expense item one hundred eight millions, 
making the grand total of money cost of the missionary service some- 
thing like one hundred forty-four millions of dollars, a sum nearly 
equal to the estimated cost of the Boulder dam, the largest project 
of its kind the United States government has ever undertaken. 

The enormous cost of the service has been widely distributed — 
shared by nearly every family in the Church. Many families have sent 
forth more than one missionary and not infrequently has a home kept 
one or more missionaries in the field continuously, for ten or a dozen 
years, and sometimes for a quarter of a century. 

I know of no way of securing comparable data from other re- 
ligious bodies, but I venture the assertion that no other church at any 
period in history for a century of time has ever given to missionary 
service such a proportion of its membership and its available resources. 

TWO GREAT ARMIES. 

For a hundred years there have been two armies constantly on the 



106 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



march — an' army of missionaries outbound from Zion, carrying the 
banner of Gospel peace and liberty; an inbound army of freed and 
happy people, faith and hope shining in every face, seeking the shelter, 
the inspiration and the glorious opportunities of a fair land and a di- 
vinely appointed society. Contingents of these armies have passed on 
almost every highway of the world ; in the states ; from the Americas, 
North and South ; up and down the devious waters of the Mississippi 
where missionaries of the early days, like Brigham, and Heber, and Wil- 
lard, and Parley, and Erastus, went on flatboats to embark on slow 
sailing vessels on their long tedious voyages to their fields in Britain, 
Scandinavia and the Continent ; across Europe to the lands of the Arab 
and the Turk and on into far off India; over the broad expanse of the 
Pacific to and from Hawaii and the distant isles of the South Seas. As 
the missionaries have passed the immigrants in these great counter- 
marches of the century, whether in their ships at sea or as they paused 
to clasp hands in their weary trek across the prairie, one can fancy their 
salutation, not always spoken perhaps, but ever in their hearts. The 
missionary says "We go to carry the Gospel." "Thank God we have it!" 
the convert replies and then adds : "We will follow you later." And 
so, indeed, they have, in one heroic round. Missionary to convert then 
convert to missionary. Great has been their gift. Generously have 
they given. 

VITAL GIFTS 

What has been given ? Why, to. every man what he needed. To the 
poor, they who are so many, the gospel of thrift ; to the rich, who are 
so few, the gospel of giving; to the intemperate, the gospel of self- 
control ; to the indolent the gospel of work ; to the downcast the gospel 
of hope ; to the militant the gospel of peace ; to the ignorant freedom 
from superstition ; to the cynical and the wavering a vital, satisfying 
philosophy ; to the sinner the gospel of repentance ; and to all faith, pur- 
ity idealism, happiness and exaltation. 

Is it difficult, then, to discover the urge which has made possible 
this remarkable missionary achievement? I think it is not. Such gifts, 
such faith, such vital endowments, are highly esteemed by man. They 
enrich his life, they enlarge his heart and fill him with gratitude. He 
thanks God and seeks to express his gratitude in terms of devotion and 
service. He sees no service comparable to that of giving to others the 
boon that he enjoys, and so he goes forth, not grudgingly, not merely 
out of a painful sense of duty, but cheerfully, eagerly, to requite the 
supreme blessing of his life and derive new and surpassing joy in the 
sharing of his joy. 

INTEREST IN MISSIONARY SERVICE NOT DIMINISHED 

I thank the Lord that the ardor for the service has not dulled with 
the passing of time. On every hand I see evidences which convince me 
that the members of the Church love to proclaim the Gospel. If men can- 
not go themselves they send their sons and daughters. Widows toil 



ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 107 



and scrimp to keep a missionary. Girls work to provide expense for 
brothers and young husbands. Quorums, wards and societies contribute, 
and occasionally a rich man opens up a generous heart and maintains 
a half dozen in the field. 

Those who go are blessed and the homes and communities which 
send them also. Crude country boys from the farm and the range 
have been exposed to the education and culture of extensive travel 
and metropolitan life in the great cities. Young men from the city have 
been subjected to the rigors of the most primitive rural life. The knowl- 
edge, the tolerance, the adventure, the polish and the experience which 
world-wide travel brings have been during the whole history of the 
Church, a product of our missionary system. I feel sure that in no 
other communities on the earth is the percentage of those who have 
"seen the world" so large as in the villages, towns and cities of the 
Latter-day Saints. 

RESULTS MORE VITAL 

Such benefits, however, while important, are but incidental. The 
more vital results are deeper than enlarged information and polish. The 
fundamental character of our manhood and womanhood has been im- 
proved. Sacrifice has taught self-control; giving has made for gen- 
erosity as it always does ; teaching the virtues has brought them into 
application, and high spirituality has ingrained testimony and soul de- 
velopment. The general uplift in all standards of living which the 
Church has brought to its adherents is in no small measure directly at- 
tributable to its missionary system. How it has blessed the home ! Fath- 
ers who have paid and prayed, mothers, wives, sisters and sweethearts 
who have been anxious and worried and true, little tots whose first lisped 
prayers have been, "Please God, keep our missionary !" have made the 
home a sanctuary indeed, the foundation of our religions life. 

BY HUMBLE MEN AND WOMEN 

This remarkable missionary work has been accomplished by hum- 
ble men and women. Their equipment, in the main, has not been the 
training of schools. It has been the influence and discipline of good 
homes, church organization, and individual testimony. The influence 
of their testimonies and their lives has been more potential than their 
preaching. The only eloquence they have required to deliver their mes- 
sage is the eloquence of the message itself, portrayed in the devotion 
and purity of their lives. They have never had to rant and yell, nor 
chant and sigh, to make a convert. They have carried the natural, 
simple, joyous message of the Christ in a natural, cheerful way. Was 
that not the Savior's way? Did he not ever suit the lesson to the peo- 
ple, their language and understanding? Have we any evidence that 
he employed rituals, ministerial garb, and sonorous phrases to make it 
impressive ? I think we have not and I advance as a worthy argument 
for the divine authenticity of the Gospel we bear the manner of its pre- 
sentation by the missionaries of our Church. 

What these ambassadors of the Lord have done for individuals, 



108 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



families, communities and nations would fill books. A half million 
hearts today swell in gratitude for their blessed service. A man con- 
templates his home, the loving family which surround him, his prosper- 
ous business, the esteem of his fellow men, the fraternity of his brethren 
in the priesthood, his faith, his contentment, his glorious hopes ; and from 
the depths of his soul he cries : "God bless the missionary who brought 
me this !" 

AFTER A HUNDRED YEARS 

Well the scene is set again, a hundred years later. The world is 
older than it was, not so provincial, better educated, more tolerant, 
perhaps more indifferent to the uses of religion, certainly more free 
from superstition, and infinitely better equipped to carry on the work 
of the world. Many things have passed into history and the great 
beyond. Hardships and cruelties, thank the Lord, have lost their sting 
and the resentment they once provoked. Men have died, but they have 
not died in vain. Joseph is not here but his successor is here. The 
power that sustained him is here. Here and now are the people and 
the truth, the needs and the opportunities. I am grateful that the mes- 
sage has not changed. It has stood the test of a century. It has not 
changed because it is true. Truth endures. 

A REDEDI CATION TO A WORTHY CAUSE 

For these things we celebrate. Our hearts cry out praises to God. 
We are subdued in the presence of marvelous accomplishment — his ac- 
complishment, not ours. But the triumph is not an end, it is a begin- 
ning. The only celebration worthy of the cause is a rededication to it. 
Its progress has been made by service. It never required service so 
much as now. If the Prophet Joseph were here, and I cannot think he 
is far away, he would speak as does our President, charging us to pre- 
pare to go forth into a new century of enlarged opportunity and carry 
the glad tidings of great joy to a new generation of God's children. 

So it is the missionary who is to serve the next century as he has 
the old. God provide him and God keep him, I humbly pray in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

If this were a picture show or an entertainment of some kind, the 
people would willingly stay to the close even if we had to be together 
two hours; or, if it were amusing, three hours. Therefore I am going 
to take your time and keep you here a little longer than usual. 

THE MARTYRDOM 

I am going to read something that I believe was written by John 
Taylor, who received four rifle balls in his body, as I remember, at the 
martyrdom of the Prophet and the Patriarch. 

"To seal the testimony of this book and the Book of Mormon, we announce 
the martyrdom of Joseph Smith the Prophet, and Hyrum Smith the Patriarch 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



109 



They were shot in Carthage jail, on the 27th of June, 1844, about five o'clock 
p. m., by an armed mob— painted black — of from 150 to 200 persons. Hyrum was 
shot first and fell calmly, exclaiming: / am a dead man! Joseph leaped from 
the window, and was shot dead in the attempt, exclaiming: O Lord my God! 
They were both shot after they were dead, in a brutal manner, and both received 
four balls. 

"John Taylor and Willard Richards, two of the Twelve, were the only 
persons in the room at the time ; the former was wounded in a savage manner 
with four balls, but has since recovered ; the latter, through the providence of 
God, escaped, without even a hole in his robe. 

"Joseph Smith, the Prophet and Seer of the Lord, has done more, save 
Jesus only, for the salvation of men in this world, than any other man that 
ever lived in it. In the short space of twenty years, he has brought forth the 
Book of Mormon, which he translated by the gift and power of God, and has 
been the means of publishing it on two continents; has sent the fulness of the 
everlasting Gospel, which it contained, to the four quarters of the earth ; has 
brought forth the revelations and commandments which compose this book of 
Doctrine and Covenants, and many other wise documents and instructions for 
the benefit of the children of men ; , gathered many thousands of Latter-day 
Saints, founded a great city, and left a fame and name that cannot be slain. 
He lived great, and he died great in the eyes of God and his people; and like 
most of the Lord's anointed in ancient times, has sealed his mission and his 
works with his own blood ; and so has his brother Hyrum. In life they were 
not divided, and in death they were not separated ! 

"When Joseph went to Carthage to deliver himself up to the pretended 
requirements of the law, two or three days previous to his assassination, he said : 
'I am going like a lamb to the slaughter ; but I am calm as a summer's morning ; 
I have a conscience void of offense towards God, and towards all men. I 
shall die innocent, and it shall yet be said of me — he was murdered in cold blood.' 
The same morning, after Hyrum had made ready to go — shall it be said to the 
slaughter? yes, for so it was — he read the following paragraph, near the close 
of the twelfth chapter of Ether in the Book of Mormon, and turned down the 
leaf upon it: 

" 'And it came to pass that I prayed unto the Lord that he would give unto 
the Gentiles grace, that they might have charity. And it came to pass that the 
Lord said unto me : If they have not charity it mattereth not unto thee, thou 
hast been faithful ; wherefore' thy garments are clean. And because thou hast 
seen thy weakness, thou shalt be made strong, even unto the sitting down in 
the place which I have prepared in the mansions of my Father. And now I 
* * * bid farewell unto the Gentiles ; yea, and also unto my brethren, whom 
I love, until we shall meet before the judgment-seat of Christ, where all men 
shall know that my garments are not spotted with your blood.' The testators 
are now dead, and their testament is in force. 

"Hyrum Smith was forty-four years old in February, 1844, and Joseph 
Smith was thirty-eight in December, 1843 ; and henceforward their names will 
be classed among the martyrs of religion ; and the reader in every nation will 
be reminded that the Book of Mormon, and this book of Doctrine and Covenants 
of the Church, cost the best blood of the nineteenth century to bring them 
forth for the salvation of a ruined world ; and that if the fire can scathe a 
green tree for the glory of God, how easy it will burn up the dry trees tc 
purify the vineyard of corruption. They lived for -glory; they died for glory; 
and glory is their eternal reward. From age to age shall their names go down 
to posterity as gems for the sanctified. 

"They were innocent of any crime, as they had often been proved before, 
and were only confined in jail by the conspiracy of traitors and wicked men ; and 
their innocent . blood on the floor of Carthage jail is a broad seal affixled to 
"Mormonism" that cannot be rejected by any court on earth, and their innocent 
blood on the escutcheon of the state of Illinois, with the broken faith of the state 
as pledged by the governor, is a witness to the truth of the everlasting Gospel 
that all the world cannot impeach ; and their innocent blood on the banner of

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



liberty, and on the magna charta of the United States, is an ambassador for the 
religion of Jesus Christ, that will touch the hearts of honest men among all 
nations; and their innocent blood, with the innocent blood of all the martyrs 
under the altar that John saw, will cry unto the Lord of Hosts till he avenges 
that blood on the earth. Amen." 

John Taylor lived, notwithstanding those frightful wounds, to be 
the Prophet, Seer and Revelator of God. A son of Hyrum Smith 
lived to be the Prophet, Seer and Revelator in your day and mine. 
Today you have listened to the testimony from this stand of a grandson 
of Hyrum Smith, and you have just listened to the testimony of a 
grandson of Willard Richards, who was with the Prophet and Patriarch 
at the time of the martyrdom. 

ENDORSES REMARKS 

I endorse with all my heart the many words of inspiration that 
we have heard from the opening of this conference until the present time. 
I join with others in praying Almighty God to bless those who go forth 
to proclaim the Gospel, who go forth to proclaim the restoration again 
to the earth of the plan of life and salvation. 

TESTIMONY OF JOSEPH SMITH AND SIDNEY RIGDON 

I rejoice that the wonderful vision recorded in the 76th section 
of the Doctrine and Covenants was given not only to Joseph Smith, 
but to Sidney Rigdon : 

"And this is the Gospel, the glad tidings, which the voice out of the 
heavens bore record unto us — 

"That he came into the world, even Jesus, to be crucified for the world, 
and to bear the sins of the world, and to sanctify the world, and to cleanse it 
from all unrighteousness. 

"That 'through him all might be saved whom the Father had put into his 
power and made by him ; 

"Who glorifies the Father, and saves all the works of his hands, except 
those sons of perdition who deny the Son after the Father has revealed him." 

T thank the Lord that Joseph Smith was not alone, but that 
Sidney Rigdon was with him and that they were able to declare to 
all the world: 

"And now, after the many testimonies which have been given of him, 
this is the testimony, last of all, which we give of him : That he lives ! 

"For we saw him, even on the right hand of God ; and we heard the voice 
bearing record that he is the Only Begotten of the Father — 

"That by him, and through him, and of him, the worlds are and were created, 
and the inhabitants thereof are begotten sons and daughters unto God." 

God lives. Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God. Joseph 
Smith was a Prophet of the true and the living God. The power of 
the priesthood of God is upon the earth and will remain, and those 
who think that possibly something may arise that will prevent this 
Church from progressing know not the truth, or they would declare 
to all the world that it has been established never again to be taken 
from the earth. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT

The chorus sang "The Lord hath done marvelous things," after 
which the benediction was pronounced by Elder Franklin S. Richards, 
the oldest living son of the late Apostle Franklin D. Richards. 

Conference adjourned until 2 :0O p. m. 

AFTERNOON MEETING 

The meeting was opened at 2 o'clock by President Heber J. Grant, 
who announced that the opening hymn would be "Come, let us anew." 

The music for this session of the Conference was furnished by 
the Latter-day Saints College Festival Chorus, under the leadership or 
George H. Durham. 

After the chorus and congregation had sung the opening number, 
the invocation was offered by Elder Alonzo A. Hinckley. 

The chorus then sang the anthem, "The heavens resound." 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

We never seem to have all the time that we would like to have at 
our conferences. Therefore, we have arranged for two extra sessions 
tomorrow, and we do most sincerely hope that the people will fill this 
building at our closing sessions. We have in the past had to draw 
our inspiration partly from empty benches on the last day of our 
conference when that has fallen on a week day. We hope that on this 
centennial occasion this will not be the case. 

We dislike very much to limit the time of our speakers, but we 
had a message from one of the senior apostles which took me only 
seven and one-half minutes to read ; so we are going to call on some of 
our brethren to speak to us and ask them to be satisfied with the same 
length of time that Brother Smoot had. 

Our first speaker will be Elder Samuel O. Bennion, President of 
the Central States Mission, who has been laboring in that mission for 
more than twenty years as its president. 

ELDER SAMUEL O. BENNION 

President of the Central States Mission 

I am very happy, my brethren and sisters, to be able to greet you 
upon this occasion, and to bear my testimony to the divinity of this 
great work. I am sure that we have all been thrilled with the inspiration 
that has accompanied each speaker. To me it has brought many mem- 
ories of past experiences in general conference assemblies. 

An opportunity has come to me that few men, I presume, have 
had — that of laboring as a missionary for more than a quarter of 
a century. When President McMurrin was speaking yesterday, I 
thought of the day that he set me apart, in 1904. In those days they 
wrote the blessings that were pronounced upon the missionaries who 



112 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



went forth. I didn't know many of the brethren who were there on 
that occasion, but Brother McMurrin was the mouthpiece ; and he told 
me in that blessing that I should stay "to the very uttermost," but 
that I should be returned home in the end. I didn't think much about 
it at the time, but began to realize its significance about five years 
later when I read it again, and I was very much impressed yesterday 
when he spoke in regard to promises made to himself, as it reminded 
me of the time that he set me apart. The words of the Lord that 
come to those who are set apart to go and preach the Gospel are surely 
to be fulfilled. They will not fail if the men and women to whom they 
are given will do their part. 

I am glad to have gone into the world. I have found faith in the 
world. I have found hundreds and thousands of people who have faith 
in God and all they lack is an opportunity to know how to live to de- 
velop that faith. Splendid men and splendid women are awaiting the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ. 

I am thankful unto the Lord that he has given us an opportunity 
to grow in a knowledge of God, and I am thankful for the great 
men who have been appointed to lead Israel in these latter days. The 
reason that the Church of Jesus Christ has flourished and grown as it 
has is because its leaders have lived in harmony with God, and other 
men and women who have been associated with them lived in harmony 
with them. These have believed in the leaders and the leaders have 
believed in God — they have walked in the presence of God. I have 
learned long ago that the Lord our God, through his Son Jesus Christ, 
is carefully guarding the interests of this great Church. He estab- 
lished it. He came into the world and introduced his Son to Joseph 
Smith, directing him to organize the Church. There is no other people 
bearing the authority of the Lord Jesus Christ to act in the name of 
God, and I bear this testimony to all men in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 

President of the Southern States Mission 

One of the great outstanding characteristics of the Latter-day 
Saints is their love for God and fellowmen. This sublime love finds 
its perfection in God our Heavenly Father. 

"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that 
whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. 

"For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world ; but that 
the world through him might be saved." (John 3:16-17.) 

The power to suffer and the will to sacrifice is always encased in 
great love, and surely only God could have suffered as he did in send- 
ing his Only Begotten Son into the world to be slain for the sins of the 
world. 

The Lord Jesus Christ suffered so much, that he, the greatest of 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 



113 



all, even God, sweat great drops of blood, that men might not suffer 
if they would repent. If the Savior had not come into the world 
and endured the suffering of death there would have been no re- 
demption for mankind. 

We see this love for God and fellowmen manifested and expressed 
in the lives of all the holy prophets of God. Think of Abinadi, the 
Book of Mormon pronhet, who. knowmg that he was going to certain 
death, voluntarily delivered himself into the hands of wicked men 
that he might declare unto them the word of God. The evil priests 
clamored that he be slain and Abinadi suffered death by fire because 
he would not deny the commandments of God. His last words were : 
"O God, receive my soul." He sealed the truth of his words by his 
death. 

We think of Alma, the high priest, resigning the office of chief 
judge of the Nephite nation to go and preach repentance to the people. 
We remember that the three sons of Mosiah refused a kingdom in order 
that they might preach the word of God to a hardened and ferocious 
people. And this inspiration, this great love, for where there is great 
love there is the will to sacrifice and to suffer, was found in the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, who said : "If my life is of no value to my friends, it 
is of no value to myself." This same spirit, I testify to you, has been 
most nobly expressed in the lives of all the successors to the Prophet 
of God. 

I repeat, my brethren and sisters, where there is great love for the 
Lord and his children, there is also great love and the will to sacrifice 
and to suffer. This work has made the Latter-day Saints great because 
it is a great work. Substituting two words in a famous college song, 
the sentiment in that song may be applied to this Church. 

, ■ - ' - -flfc-. 

"Mother of men grown strong in giving, 
Honor to him thy lights have led. 
Rich in the toil of thousands living; 
Proud of the deeds of thousands dead." 
We who have felt thy power, and known thee : 
We in whose lives thy lights avail, 
High in our hearts, enshrine, enthrone thee, 
Mother of men— the Church." 

Truly the Church is the mother of men. 

That soul-reviving blessing from our beloved President, Sunday 
morning, thrilled home to our hearts, and we, the people of Israel, love 
our leader. We proclaim that we ask the blessings of God upon our 
prophet, and upon all the General Authorities of the Church, for with 
them, by the help of the Most High, we propose to go on to the glorious 
consummation of the work of God. In the name of the Lord Jesus 
Christ, Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ELDER WILLIAM R. SLOAN 

1 President of the Northwestern States Mission 

Three clays hence will be commemorated in the great Northwest, 
the centennial of the pioneers to the state of Oregon. On the 10th 
day of April, 1830, eighty-three men, fur traders, trappers, and as- 
sistants, left St. Louis, Missouri, and they traversed the trail now known 
as the Oregon Trail and arrived in Oregon, and from the 10th until 
the 29th day of December that wonderful event will be commemorated. 
The President of the United States, senators and other leading men 
have given approval of this great commemoration. 

Today we commemorate an event. I should like to read just a 
word or two from one of the editorials of a newspaper in Portland. 

"The Pacific Northwest has profited by a share of the growth and influence 
of the Mormon Church. Latter-day Saint missionaries were first sent to 
Portland in 1896. The Northwestern States Mission was formed the following 
year. The Church has now a Portland membership of one thousand and a 
local investment of more than two hundred thousand dollars, including a 
handsome chapel, dedicated a year ago. Wherever they are, the Mormons today 
should find full measure of appreciation and congratulation on their century 
achievements." 

I should like to read another clipping from a recent magazine: 

"Greatest Power in Spiritual Forces. 
"What line of research will see the greatest development within the next fifty 
years ? This is the question that Robert Babson asked the late Charles P. Steinmetz 
while the world's foremost electrical engineer was visiting in the home of the 
nation's leading business statistician. It was natural to suppose that a scientist who 
had given nearly half a century to inventive processes would be thinking in terms 
of the future development of radio, aeronautics, or power transmission. Instead 
Mr. Steinmetz replied : 'Mr. Babson, [ think the greatest discovery will be made 
along spiritual lines. Here is a force which history clearly teaches has been the 
greatest power in the development of men and history. Yet we have merely been 
playing with it and have never seriously studied it as we have the physical forces. 
Some day people will learn that material things do not bring happiness and are of 
little use in making men and women creative and powerful. Then the scientists 
of the world will turn their laboratories over to the study of God and prayer and 
the spiritual forces which as yet have hardly been scratched. When this day 
comes, the world will see more advancement in one generation than it has 
seen in the past four." 

" 'If radio's slim fingers 
Can pluck a melody 
From night and toss it over 
A continent or sea; 
If petaled white notes 
Of a violin 

Are blown across a mountain 
Or a city's din; 
If songs like crimson roses 
Are culled from thin, blue air. 
Why should mortals wonder 
If God hears prayer?'" 

In the pageant the other evening were six thousand men and 



ELDER WILLIAM R. SLOAN 



115 



women, all standing on their feet, faces toward the beacon light, singing 
in unison, "Praise God from whom all blessings flow." 

I know this work is of God, and I rejoice in this most glorious 
privilege that I have enjoyed, being one of those mission presidents 
on whom God's prophets, in all love and kindness gave such a wonderful 
blessing. I hope the Lord will bless me. 

I extend greetings to you, my brethren and sisters, from your 
sons and your daughters in the -Northwestern States Mission. They 
are noble, sweet, pure, God-fearing boys and girls. The Lord loves 
and is magnifying them, and they are measuring up admirably to the 
responsibilities imposed upon them. 

This is my prayer, my testimony of the truth of his work. I bear 
it humbly, in the name of Jesus Christ, pur Redeemer, Amen. 

ELDER NOAH S. POND 

President of the Northern States Mission 

My dear brethren and sisters, I feel very humble and very happy 
to have the privilege of reporting the Northern States Mission of 
the Church. We have something like one hundred missionaries in that 
field at the present time. Last month fifteen of our most experienced 
missionaries were released, and only one was sent there. Brethren 
and sisters, we need your sons and daughters, and some of you, my 
brethren of the authorities of the wards and stakes. Your services 
are much appreciated, have been and will be, in the great ministry of 
the Church. 

Last year we sold eight thousand and one Books of Mormon in 
our mission. We loaned thirteen thousand four hundred fifty-three 
copies. In sales and loans a few less than twenty-three thousand five 
hundred copies of the Book of Mormon were placed in the hands of 
the inhabitants of our area. With a population of between twenty-five 
and thirty millions of people, however, in those six states, you can 
readily understand what a vast field and enormous work there is for 
a hundred or a hundred and twenty-five missionaries to perform. With 
a possible exception or two, our missionaries are in the enjoyment of 
good health; they are happy, industrious, humble, and faithful in 
their work. The blessings of the Lord attend their labors. 

Recently, last month in fact, we were impressed to send two of 
our fine young elders into a portion of the state of Iowa that our mis- 
sionaries had not tracted or labored in for some time in the past. These, 
two young men, going into the city of Dubuque, where our elders had 
not been for a number of years, felt rather discouraged at the con- 
clusion of the first week's work. The following Sunday morning they 
were impressed to visit the Sunday School of the First Congrega- 
tional church of that city. The superintendent gave them a fine wel- 
come. After the preliminary exercises they were invited to speak to 



116 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



the membership of that Sunday School. They made a fine impression, 
in a few brief remarks. The minister greeted them, invited them to 
dine with him, brought them back to his evening service and gave 
them an opportunity of preaching the Gospel to a hundred and fifty 
or two hundred members of his church. A very similar circumstance 
happened almost simultaneously in Evansville, Indiana, where two of 
our young elders found a Pentecostal minister, who welcomed them 
to his church and they had the privilege of preaching the Gospel to a 
hundred and fifty or two hundred members of that faith. 

I have been very much impressed by the manner in which the work 
is progressing in our organizations. Sister Pond has much pleasure 
in the Relief Society work of the mission, where she has nineteen 
societies. The Young Men's, the Young Ladies', the Sunday School, and 
the Primary organizations are progressing ; so also is the Aaronic priest- 
hood. W!e have it under as capable supervision as it is possible to pro- 
vide, and we are very happy to note that the work is progressing. 

The outstanding feature of our work during the last month was the 
visit of our dear President Grant, that we were favored with. He came 
into our mission and remained with us from February 16th to February 
25th. During that time we had the privilege of dedicating the new 
chapel in Columbus. Ohio, and our beautiful chapel in the University 
branch in the city of Chicago ; likewise visiting the chapel that had been 
completed during the past two years in the city of Detroit, where we 
have a beautiful building and a fine congregation of our membership, 
and active work. He also had the privilege of visiting our chapels and 
our congregations in Dayton and Cincinnati, Ohio, also Milwaukee, Wis- 
consin. Immediately following this visit a number of baptisms were 
performed. The saints and the missionaries will never forget the 
marvelous impression, the testimony, and the Spirit of the Lord that 
accompanied the visit of President Grant. We have been favored, since 
our entry into the mission with a visit from Apostle Ballard, likewise 
a tour of the mission by Apostle Orson F. Whitney. These brethren 
of the General Authorities of the Church are welcome. The saints, 
friends, investigators and missionaries will travel hundreds of miles for 
a single opportunity of meeting and hearing the words of inspiration 
that fall from the lips of the servants of God. 

I am happy, my brethren and sisters, to report the progress of the 
work in the Northern States Mission, where we are also sending out 
missionaries. I am also happy because of our baptisms. Five baptisms 
were performed the first Sunday after President Grant's visit. I have 
a letter, just received today, from our mission secretary in connection 
with other matters, in which he said that the services in Chicago last 
Sunday were outstanding. Both our chapels were filled to capacity, a 
pageant in one and a specially prepared program in the other. Seven 
baptisms were performed in the city of Chicago last Sunday afternoon. 

My brethren and sisters, there is joy and pleasure in this great 
work. May we have more of your sons and daughters, and some of you 



ELDER NOAH S. POND 



117 



brethren of bishoprics, high councils and stake presidencies, for you 
little appreciate the value of your services until you have filled a three, 
four, five or six months mission in the mission fields of the Church. 

God bless the presiding authorities of this great Church. And 
God bless our young people in the mission fields, for there also they 
are preparing for this missionary work. The Northern States Mission 
has within the last few months or years, sent out eight missionaries into 
other mission fields. We are happy to note that we have two young 
sister missionaries in the mission home at this time, preparing for the 
California and the Northwestern States missions. And our young 
people are learning and are desirous of becoming familiar with the 
principles of the Gospel, that from the mission field they also may go 
forward and preach this great Gospel. 

I testify of the truthfulness of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. I 
cannot recount a more happy moment or period in my life than we have 
enjoyed in this centennial. When I read the other evening of our 
friends, the Reorganites, celebrating in Independence, Missouri, six 
or seven thousand strong, the centennial of their church, I wondered 
how they would reconcile thirty years which they must falsify in his- 
tory, or they must abandon the word "Reorganization." How can 
they be the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and celebrate 
one hundred years of its existence, when they came into existence 
thirty years after the original Church was organized. 

May the Lord bless us with faithfulness. I testify to the truth- 
fulness of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and pray for his blessings upon 
the First Presidency, the Council of the Apostles, the presidency and 
priesthood at home, all the membership of the Church throughout the 
world, and all the good and true and the noble with whom we labor, 
and to whom we are seeking to bring the Gospel, the plan of life and 
salvation. I pray for our Father's blessings in the name of Jesus Christ, 
Amen. 

ELDER ELIAS S. WOODRUFF 

President of the Western States Mission 

It is a great honor to bring you the greetings of the saints and 
missionaries who labor in the Western States Mission. Many of 
them would have liked to be here to enjoy these services, even as you 
have. But I counseled them to remain at home and hold such services 
as they were capable of conducting and to invite as many friends as they 
could possibly get to attend our services in the twenty-seven branches 
that we have in the mission. Services have been arranged and have 
been held in all of those branches and also in a number of places where 
we have only Sunday Schools. As far as it was possible we have 
celebrated in a fitting manner this wonderful event. 

The conference to me has been a tremendous inspiration. If I 
were to think of the responsibility that rests upon me as a servant of 



118 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



the Lord, without the thought that God is directing the work, I would 
be so completely overwhelmed as to be unable to proceed. I know that 
we are in our Father's work, that his power is behind us ; and it gives 
me, as it gives my brethren, courage to proceed with the work, with 
confidence that it will triumph and grow and spread over all the earth. 

In the Western States Mission the saints are faithful. They are 
good tithe-payers, they are attending their meetings in goodly number, 
they are trying to the extent of their ability to spread the word among 
their friends. They are trying to set an example to others, to show 
them that by being members of the Church they have lived better lives 
than they would have done otherwise ; and in that way are preaching 
the Gospel by example. And in all respects we are endeavoring to 
serve the Lord. 

It is my hope and prayer that the Lord will bless me that I may 
be able to take back from this conference a message to the saints and 
missionaries that will at least supplement the impressions they have 
already received from the meetings they have held and what radio « 
reception they may have enjoyed. 

May God bless and inspire his servants who preside over the 
Church, that they may ever be true to their trust. May you, my brethren 
and sisters, sustain them and love them and uphold their hands by 
being faithful to your trust, that the Church may grow and flourish 
as we know it will. As has been so splendidly expressed here, the 
thought is there is no danger that the Church will not proceed and 
grow ; the danger is that you or I may fall by the wayside. 

I humbly pray that we may never lose our faith, but that we may 
be able to keep step with the progress of the great Church which has 
given us this wonderful inspiration and through which we are so 
greatly blessed. I pray God to bless you, to bless the saints everywhere, 
to bless you who are preparing to send missionaries out, that you may 
be able to send them, and that you may be prospered so that you can 
care for them. I do want to make a plea, as President Pond has done, 
that you send your sons into the mission field. I think our mission 
has never been so low in numbers as at the present time. We released 
twenty-eight missionaries last month, and received three. We are badly 
in need of help. Those we have are laboring valiantly and splendidly, 
and I have pleasure in reporting that all are well. 

God bless you. Amen. 

ELDER JAMES H. MOYLE 

President of the Eastern States Mission 

In view of the necessity for brevity, I trust President Grant will, 
if necessary, assist me in keeping within my allotted time. 

I am pleased to report that the Eastern States Mission is in a 
healthy, growing condition. The missionaries are enjoying good health, 
with rare exceptions, and doing splendid work. Although there are 
few baptisms, I know that there are many friends being made and 



ELDER JAMES H. MOYLE 



119 



converts who are not being baptized. Intelligent, influential men have 
openly confessed to me that they were converted and believed all that 
we teach, but that they couldn't break the hearts of their wives and 
embarrass their relatives socially, and could not make the sacrifice at 
present and break away from their life-long associations. But they 
are real friends. One thing is certain, that our young missionaries, 
though not baptizing many, have a personal development that is in- 
valuable, an accomplishment that will go with and influence for good 
their lives, and which will be of as much importance to them as if they 
had spent the same time in a great university. 

I was greatly interested in President Roberts' relation of the 
prophecy of Joseph Smith, that there would be organized in the city of 
New York a stake of Zion. One year ago, from this stand, I stated 
that I had been very greatly impressed with the fact that we needed 
such an organization in greater New York City and its environs. 
When I entered the mission in January, a year ago, the branch presi- 
dency said that there were three hundred members enrolled in the New 
York City branch alone. That does not include the Brooklyn branch 
and some small adjacent branches. We have been making a real effort 
to find the names and residence of the members of the Church, 
especially those who have come from these valleys east, and who live 
in that great and populous center. Now the branch presidency say- 
that they believe there are fifteen hundred, where we only had three 
hundred of record. At our conference held in New York City in 
February a year ago, we had about two hundred and fifty people 
present, which was considered a large audience. At the conference held 
a month ago tomorrow, at which President Grant and Apostle Ballard 
were present, there were seven hundred and fifty present, and the hall, 
rented especially for the occasion, couldn't hold all that came. They 
were standing up and the aisles were filled. A similar condition existed 
in Washington, where we had about four hundred present, and where 
there was no organized branch of the Church prior to the great war. 
On the 9th of March we not only held a meeting in our chapel at 
Brooklyn, at ten o'clock a. m., into which was crowded something over 
three hundred people, but at two o'clock in Newark, New Jersey, another 
meeting was held with over two hundred present. That branch was 
organized only a few years since. Then in the evening, in New York 
City, we had the large meeting referred to, which was by far the 
largest gathering of saints ever held in New York City. 

One of the material contributing reasons for the growing interest 
in the Church there, was the presence there a month or two before of 
Presidents Ivins and Nibley, who spent a week or ten days studying 
the needs of our members in Washington and New York City. They 
were impressed with the necessity for a more appropriate and per- 
manent place in which to assemble. That fact, and the interest which 
President Grant and his counselors manifested, together with the 
presence of Apostle Ballard, did arouse a real interest in our conference, 
which I am sure will be fruitful. 

I have been greatly surprised, and deeply impressed, with the 



120 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



fact that the sentiment in the east toward our people is greatly changed. 
This is true especially among the financial, industrial, and commercial 
leaders of the country, who have evidently become acquainted with 
our people and their accomplishments, and the character and merits 
of our young people, for they have been selecting a surprising number 
of them, in view of the small number of our people, as executives in 
such instiutions. And why should they be looking for the kind of 
young men we are producing in these mountains? Because they have 
been trained and reared in the homes of Latter-day Saints, where the 
Word of Wisdom has been observed. They are looking for sober, 
temperate, industrious, God-fearing men, and there is no place in the 
world where they can be found more than here. The time has passed, 
in my opinion, when our Mormon boys should feel that they are 
discriminated against by the men who stand at the head of these great 
institutions. I am sure this is true. Men and women developed here 
under the conditions named, are also successful and active physicians, 
with a splendid practice ; lawyers, occupying places in the leading law 
offices in New York ; professors and teachers in the great universities 
there, several from the Brigham Young University, others from our 
state university. In nothing are our mountain boys more con- 
spicuous there than in their success and prominence as engineers, 
especially electrical engineers. I am more than pleased to say that you 
can find our boys and girls comfortably and favorably located in 
practically all the great business institutions such as, banking, mer- 
chandising, real estate, and other commendable activities; they are 
accountants, artists, actors, singers and music teachers. 

There is a great change of sentiment coming over the world, and 
while we do not baptize many we are making friends and arousing 
interest in our people and the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Last Sunday 
there was doubtless read in the Unitarian church in Reading, Pennsyl- 
vania,, by one of our humble elders, the address that President Grant 
read here. It is the second or third opportunity that we have had ill 
leading cities in the mission, in Unitarian churches, which are especially 
broad and liberal. We have one preacher on Long Island, who has had 
a congregation there for years, who is preaching every Sabbath the 
Gospel as we understand it, and his people generally do not know it; 
but he knows it, and believes it, and says he is going to be baptized. 

I once more urge upon the fathers, mothers, and bishops throughout 
the Church the. importance of sending us the names of our people who 
have left the organized branches of the Church in the west, in order 
that we may interest them in the work. We believe that there are 
hundreds of them being lost from lack of contact with the Church. 
We are finding some constantly who seem to have been practically lost 
and forgotten, and leaving the Church simply through lack of contact 
with it. They should formally become members of the branches of the 
Church there, just the same as when they move from one ward to 
another here at home, then we could find them and look after them. 

A notable instance. I had to go to Florida recently to find a young- 
man. I met his parents there. They gave me his address and expressed 



ELDER JAMES H. MOYLE 



121 



the fear that he was drifting away from the Church. When I returned, 
I invited him to our home, and to my astonishment he said he had 
been in the city for over a year and did not know where our place of 
worship was or our headquarters, or that there was such there. Before 
he left he promised that he would write his mother and say that he 
was going to attend church. When I called his attention to what 
he said as he left us, he replied, "I am not only going to so write her, 
but I am going to be a regular attendant at church." We had no 
means of reaching that young man prior to meeting his mother. The 
church officers, diligent as they are, knew nothing of him. We have 
many such cases. 

There is another thing which has deeply impressed me. Never 
before has there been such an interest taken in the Book of Mormon 
as there is now. Think of what President Pond says is going on in his 
mission. While he is leading in the sale and distribution of copies of 
the Book of Mormon, the same condition exists more or less throughout 
all the missions. President Bennion says that they are sending out 
annually from the Zion's printing office, and actually selling, something 
like fifty thousand copies of the Book of Mormon in these United 
States alone. Fifty thousand sold by this one agency, and in addition 
to those thus sold, there are many more such books lent and placed 
with readers. 

The Book of Mormon has been a subject of deep interest to me 
from my youth. I was intensely interested in the realities of angels 
appearing to men on earth, and the marvelous things revealed to Joseph 
Smith in connection with the introduction of the Book of Mormon to 
the world. I shall never forget my experience early in July, 1885, as 
I was returning home from the University of Michigan where I 
graduated in 1885. I went directly to Richmond, Missouri, for the 
sole purpose of meeting the then remaining living witness to the divinity 
of the Book of Mormon, David Whitmer. I inquired of the bus driver, 
the hotel clerk, and others, as far as possible, as to the character and 
reputation of David Whitmer. All said he was a fine old man, an 
excellent citizen, and was highly respected in the community. I 
introduced myself by presenting him with a book that I thought would 
please him, and said to him that I had just graduated from college. 
He was then in the eighties, with his hair and beard white, but in fair 
health. It was about three years before his death. I said to him : "1 
was born and reared in the Church and I do pray of you to let me 
know if there is any possibility of your having been deceived. I am 
just commencing life as you are preparing to lay it down, and I beg of 
you to tell me if there is anything connected with the testimony which 
you have borne to the world that could possibly have been deceptive or 
misunderstood." I further said, in an earnest youthful appeal, that I 
did not want to go through life believing a falsehood, that it was in 
his power to make known the truth to me. He described to me the 
details of the occasion, of the angel presenting the plates from which 
the Book of Mormon was translated. The scene was in the woods, 
with nothing between the angel and himself except a log that had;

fallen and was lying between them. He declared that he saw the 
angel who had with him the plates from which the Book of Mormon 
was translated, and that in the presence of the angel he did hear the 
angel declare that they had been translated correctly. While I am 
speaking from memory, the foregoing most essential facts to me and 
which were the sole object of my visit, were so indelibly impressed upon 
my mind, that they are perfectly clear and unmistakable. I asked him 
many questions concerning his experiences with the origin of the Book 
of Mormon, and why he left the Church, all of which he endeavored 
to answer frankly. We talked for a considerable time. His. mind 
seemed clear and his mentality above rather than below the average. 
He said he had never left the Church, that they had maintained a 
branch of the Church in Richmond, and that he had always been active 
in it ; that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God, and that the revelations 
he received up to the year 1835 were from God, but that he accepted 
none of them subsequent to that time. He appeared to have become 
embittered against Sidney Rigdon especially, and I fancied turned 
against the Prophet because of his placing Rigdon ahead of those who 
had stood by the Prophet in his early work. 

He said with seeming pride and much interest, that he had the 
first copy of the manuscript from which the Book of Mormon was 
printed, in his humble home. And it was a humble home. That when 
the great cyclone struck Missouri, and houses were blown about and 
destroyed, every room in his house was destroyed except that in which 
the manuscript was kept. He seemed to feel that it was divinely pro- 
tected. President Joseph F. Smith advised me that the copy of the 
manuscript was not the original, but one of the three originals. His 
sincerity was plainly shown when I asked him if he would sell the 
manuscript and place a price upon it. He replied that he would not. 

There is much that might be said on the subject of the Book of 
Mormon. Even Colonel Lindbergh is arousing interest in the subject 
as probably no one else is today, through the pictures which he has been 
able to take from the air while flying over Central America, Mexico 
and the southwestern part of the United States. Front pages of the 
leading papers in the east are publishing those pictures, with interesting 
and instructive articles written by archaeologists. They are attempting 
to unravel the history of those lost cities. But I must close. 

The story of the Book of Mormon which our missionaries are 
carrying to the people of the world and of which they bear testimony as 
to its divinity, is accompanied with that clear and unfailing guide 
like unto that which the Savior presented, when he said, "If any man 
will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, 
or whether I speak of myself." In connection therewith our message, 
as missionaries, to the world is, for them to read and follow the advice 
found in the last chapter of the Book of Mormon, in which the Prophet 
Moroni, referring to the contents of the book, gives the sure and un- 
mistakable test, similar to that which the Savior gave, when he said : 

"And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would 
ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not 



ELDER JAMES H. MOYLE 



123 



true ; and if ye shall askj with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in 
Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost. 
"And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things.'' 

That is the test that we are submitting to the world, and that 
leaven is affecting- the world ; it is influencing the world. What greater 
and surer test could there be ? 

May the Lord help us to appreciate the blessings that we enjoy 
in the Gospel of our Redeemer, is my prayer, in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 

ELDER MILES L. JONES 

President of the East Central States Mission 

I hope that I shall be able to make my remarks short enough so 
as to make up for part of the time that President Moyle has occupied, 
so that the rest may have time for theirs. 

I rejoice, my brethren and sisters, in the opportunity that I have 
of meeting with you upon this occasion. I have rejoiced exceedingly in 
the various sessions of this conference. I have been very much 
impressed today with the rendition of the music, as given by this 
wonderful gathering of young men and young ladies, the rising youth 
of Zion, young men and young women who sometime perhaps may 
be called into the world to spread the Gospel of light among the nations 
of the earth. 

Just a short time ago it so happened that I came in contact with 
a very prominent lady who was connected with one of the other- 
denominations, and in the course of our remarks I asked, her how she 
found the spirituality of the young people in her church, and without 
hesitancy whatever she said : "There is no spirituality among the young- 
people today, not in the least. They are seeking after the pleasures of 
life and are not looking after spiritual development." And I thought 
how much different is that from the Latter-day Saints. Here we see 
it exemplified today, these young men, young ladies, coming here filled 
with the spirit of the Gospel, and singing the songs of Zion and bringing 
forth the Spirit of the Lord in our day. 

I rejoice in the work that is being performed in the Bast Central 
States Mission. I bring to you fathers and mothers the greetings 
of your sons and your daughters, yes and to the wives the greetings 
of your husbands, who are laboring in that mission. All are enjoying 
good health with but few exceptions, and the work of the Lord is 
progressing. 

Just a few days ago I happened to pick up a newspaper and in 
reading through it I found the comment of a very prompinent writer ; 
writing upon religious matters and referring to several denominations 
he made this remark : 

"It may so be in the course of time that the Mormon people will repudiate 
the Prophet Joseph Smith and the Book of Mormon, and then they will become 
one with us."

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



I thought how much different that is from the way we look at 
things. And then just a few days following that one of our saints hap- 
pened to be listening over the radio to the world's book man who 
speaks every afternoon with the exception of Sunday, on some subject 
regarding which a question has been asked. He called me over the 
phone and I stepped into the room where my wife and I have a radio, 
and .there I heard Mr. R. C. Preble, who had been asked this question: 
"What publication do we have that is the most reliable, or rather that 
gives us the most reliable information regarding the origin of the 
American Indian?" And he gave as his answer, without any hesitancy 
whatever, "The Book of Mormon." Then he proceeded to recite and 
tell how the Book of Mormon was delivered to the Prophet Joseph 
Smith by an angel from on high, and that the record was taken from 
the Mormon Hill, as he put it, and that it was translated through 
the instrumentality of a pair of spectacles which were hidden in the 
box with the record. And then he went on to tell how it was translated 
by the Prophet Joseph Smith and others who wrote as he translated it 
by looking through this pair of spectacles. Then he went on to tell 
that the Book of Mormon contains the history of a people who 
left Jerusalem some six hundred years before Christ's advent into the 
world, and that they landed upon the west coast of South America, 
where they settled, built wonderful cities, and eventually came on into 
this land and scattered over the various parts of North America. He 
then stated that in the extent of time those who were the most indus- 
trious in building cities were destroyed by the people called the 
Lamanites, now known as the American Indians ; the records which 
this destroyed people had kept were the ones that were hidden in the 
Hill Cumorah and were received by the Prophet Joseph Smith from 
the hands of an angel. He gave such a fair account of it, and as this 
was the fourth question that I had heard him speak upon in regard to 
our people, in answer to questions which had been asked, I thought that 
I would take occasion to write to him, which I did. I dictated a letter, 
saying "If at any time you happen to be speaking upon any allied 
subjects pertaining to our people I will appreciate it very much if you 
will make the announcement that if there are any libraries in that 
part of the country that do not have a copy of the Book of Mormon, 
I shall be pleased to furnish them free of cost." I said further, "If you 
have not a copy of the book I shall be very pleased to send you one 
with my compliments, and if at any time when you are speaking on 
any subject pertaining to our people and you haven't first-hand infor- 
mation I shall be pleased to furnish you it." It was about ten days 
before the letter reached him. I addressed it to W. H. A. S., the 
station at Louisville, because he was talking over the national "hookup" 
and I didn't know just where he was; but it finally found him in the 
city of Chicago, and he immediately answered my letter and said that 
he would be very pleased indeed to receive a copy of the Book of 
Mormon. I sent him one with my compliments, and also enclosed with 
it several other pamphlets which contain some of the teachings of our 
people. I received another nice letter from him stating that he had 



ELDER MILES L. JONES 



125 



received the literature, and that his secretary had already begun reading 
the Book of Mormon, and he was going to do so as the opportunity 
presented itself. And he continued : "I want to thank you for the little 
pamphlets which you enclosed, because of the information that they 
contain." 

I thought how much different are conditions today from what they 
have been in times past. Conditions in the world are changing. I find 
that we have friends on every hand. We have opportunities of visiting, 
every night that we have open, holding cottege meetings, street meet- 
ings and private meetings with the people and conversing with them. 

I pray that God may bless us that we may go on with the work, 
and that you at home may assist us by sending your sons and daughters, 
which I pray, in the name of Jesus. Amen.

and Cov., Sec. 6:7.) Music composed by George H. Durham. 

ELDER REY L. PRATT 

Of the First Council of Seventy, and President of the Mexican Mission 

I sincerely trust, my brethren and sisters, that the Spirit that has 
actuated those who have spoken during this Centennial Conference may 
be given to me, that I may be able to say something that will strengthen 
us in our faith and in our testimonies of the Gospel, that we hold so 
dear. 

The Psalmist said, "Except the Lord build the house, they labor 
in vain that build it; except the Lord keep the city, the watchmen 
waketh but in vain. 

"It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the 
bread of sorrows." 

In connection with his words my mind has reverted to the counsel 
of Gamaliel, that wise Jew, who asked the Jews to desist in their 
persecution of the apostles, counseling that if their work was not of 
God it would come to naught, even as had the work of many that he 
mentioned who had raised up and taught strange doctrines, and who 
had gained considerable following, but, when they had passed on, their 
work had ceased with them. I recall also the words of the Savior to his 
disciples, for he reproved the Jews in his day, citing from Isaiah, 
saying unto them : 

"Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying, 

"This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoreth me 

with their lips ; but their heart is far from me. 

"But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments 

of men. 

"And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand : 
"Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man ; but that which 

cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man. 

"Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees 

were offended, after they heard this saying? 



126 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

"But he answered and said, Every plant, which my Heavenly Father hatn 
not planted, shall be rooted up." 

I have been reflecting upon these scriptures, my brethren and 
sisters, in connection with the history of the Church during the past 
hundred years. It has grown marvelously, notwithstanding the per- 
secutions that have been hurled against it, from even before the Church 
was organized, for Joseph Smith, when he announced to the world 
that he had seen a vision, was made the subject of the most bitter 
persecution, and it never ceased to follow him until he sealed his 
testimony with his blood. The Church itself, from then for many 
years, was submitted to persecution. It has been submitted to ridicule. 
The wise and the learned of the world, from the standpoint of the 
wisdom and the learning of men, have ridiculed this work, and have 
really predicted and prophesied its downfall ; and they seem to be very 
much alarmed because their predictions have not come true. But my 
brethren and sisters, they have not reckoned with the vitality of this 
work; they have not reckoned with the fact that the Gospel restored 
and the Church organized means more than the mere setting up of a 
religious system, officered by mortal man. They have not taken into 
consideration the fact that the restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ 
means the restoration to earth again of the power of God to speak, 
and to act in his name, the restoration of the holy priesthood. If you 
will stop to reflect for a minute, it will occur to you, perhaps, strange, 
as it has to men that I have spoken to in the world, 'that Joseph Smith, 
after he received the wonderful vision in which the Father and the Son 
appeared to him, did not immediately set up a religious system; he 
waited ; and why ? Because he sensed and realized that even with that 
great vision, which restored to the world that which the world was 
most in need of at that time, a knowledge of God as he is, still he was 
not empowered to speak in the name of God, to 'minister in the 
ordinances of the Gospel, with authority to organize the Church and 
place in it those officers that 'Christ placed in it, namely apostles, pro- 
phets, etc. Joseph Smith did not know when that would come when 
he received that vision. It was not until in the due time of the Lord 
when he received the priesthood, first the Aaronic at the hands of John 
the Baptist, that he performed any ordinances for the salvation of the 
souls of men ; and not until he had received the keys of the kingdom, 
or the Melchizedek Priesthood, and the holy apostleship, did he pre- 
sume in any way to organize the Church and to set in operation the 
Gospel as the power of God unto salvation among the children of men, 
here upon the earth. 

Now, brethren and sisters, if this work were not of God I believe 
that we could believe still, today, that it would come to naught. But I 
know, by the manifestations of the Holy Spirit, and by the experiences 
that I have had in ministering as a humble missionary in the world, 
that the priesthood, restored to earth in this dispensation, is a reality. 
It is the power of God to act in his name, and its works ; it operates. 

I have been laboring, too, as a missionary, and I have been laboring 



ELDER REY L. PRATT 



127 



among Book of Mormon people. There is no book in the world that 
has so appealed to me, and that so absorbs me, in its contemplation, 
as the Book of Mormon. And my heart has gone out through these 
long years, nearly a quarter of a century that I have labored without 
ceasing, in the interest of the people who are the descendants of the 
prophets who wrote that book. 

In thinking over the history of the Church I recall that in the 
year of its organization the matter of preaching the Gospel to the 
Lamanite people occupied, with great concern, the minds of the leaders 
of the Church. In September, 1830, a revelation was given in which 
Oliver Cowdery was given to know that he was to carry the Gospel 
to the Lamanites. In October of the same year there were included in 
that mission, by direct revelation, Parley P. Pratt and Ziba Peterson 
and others to preach the Gospel to the Lamanites. There was a 
beginning. It has been preached at different times from then down 
until now, and in the specific work that I am engaged in, namely the 
Mexican Mission, for fifty-one years has the Gospel been preached 
in the Spanish language to the Mexican people. In the year 1879 an 
apostle of the Lord, Moses Thatcher, climbed nearly to the summit of 
the great volcano Popocatepetl that overlooks all of the country, nearly 
from sea to sea, in the interior of Mexico, at an elevation of perhaps 
eighteen thousand feet. There, stretching out his hands, he dedicated 
the land of Mexico to the preaching of the Gospel and to the redemption 
of the Lamanites, in that land. 

But no one who has hot followed the history of it closely, knows 
the hectic time we have had in preaching the- Gospel in Mexico. Dis- 
couragements have been piled upon discouragements, until I have 
wondered sometimes — I have never doubted, but I have wondered 
just when we would see the fruits of our labors, and just when I 
might feel secure, and sure that the Gospel was planted in that land to 
stay there. We have had revolutions nearly all of that time, and since- 
1910 we have had revolutions continuously. Our missionaries have 
had to leave the republic, on one pretext and on another, and our saints 
have been left, many times for years at a time, to struggle as best they 
could, only connected with the body of the Church by correspondence 
which I have been able to carry on with their leaders down there, with 
their branch presidents particularly. 

Five years ago, nearly, now, because of controversy between church 
and state in that land, all of our missionaries were obliged to leave 
the country and the saints were again left to shift for themselves as 
best they could. We prayed for the time that we might return, and 
they prayed for the return of the missionaries. In every letter that has 
been exchanged they have plead that we might come back to them, and 
they have asked the Lord that the missionaries might be returned to 
them. 

I have had some misgivings as to what their condition would be, 
during all this long time that the missionaries were away from them. 
The Lord opened the way in February, and alone I went into the 
interior of Mexico. I traveled in that country for six weeks, in com-

pany with the branch presidents and our local district president that we 
have named in the interior of the country. I visited in their branches, 
merely as a member, and, because of the restrictions, not permitted 
to call the people together as an officer of the Church, nor to speak 
to them as an officer of the Church ; but as a member and in conversation 
with them I visited them all. And I am happy with what 1 found in that 
land. We carried the Gospel to them. We not only taught them faith 
in God, faith in the Gospel as restored, faith in the principles of re- 
pentance and baptism and in the Church organization, but, brethren and 
sisters, we laid our hands on their heads, during the years that are 
past, and we ordained them to the priesthood. Deacons, teachers, 
priests, and elders have been ordained in that land. Branches have 
been organized. A district has been organized, and men from among 
the local priesthood there have been called to officiate and to conduct 
the affairs of that mission as best they could. I confess that through 
the years that have passed I have felt rather as I think Alma must 
have felt when he embarked on his great missionary journey. He 
wished that he might be endowed with the voice of an angel, that he 
might preach to the people with the voice of a trumpet, that all men 
might hear and be brought to a knowledge of the truth. I have felt 
many times that I should like to be able to do more than it seemed 
that I was physically able to do. I have felt that the restrictions that 
kept me back were galling, and I wished to get into the land, for I feared 
for the stability of the people of the land that had joined the Church. 

I would like to read to you, however, the word of the Lord that 
came to us, because it comes to me as a revelation, and it made me 
more contented to do just as the Lord seems to make it possible for 
me to do in my ministry. Alma said : 

"O that I were an angel, and could have the wish of mine heart, that I might 
go forth and speak with the trump of God, with a voice to shake the earth, and 
cry repentance unto every people ! 

"Yea, I would declare unto every soul, as with the voice of thunder, 
repentance and the plan of redemption, that they should repent and come unto 
our God, that there might not be more sorrow upon all the face of the earth. 

"But behold, I am a man, and do sin in my wish; for I ought to be content 
with the things which the Lord hath allotted unto me. 

"I ought not to harrow up in my desires, the firm decree of a just God, 
for I know that he granteth unto men according to their desire, whether it be 
unto death or unto life; yea, I know that he allotteth unto men according to 
their wills, whether they be unto salvation or unto destruction. 

"Yea, and I know that good and evil have come before all men; he that 
knoweth not good from evil is blameless ; but he that knoweth good and evil, 
to him it is given according to his desires, whether he desireth good or evil, 
life or death, joy or remorse of conscience. 

"Now, seeing that I know these things, why should I desire more than to 
perform the work to which I have been called? 

"Why should I desire that I were an angel, that I could speak unto all 
the ends of the earth? 

"For behold" — and mark these words — "the Lord doth grant unto all nations, 
of their own nation and tongue, to teach his word, yea, in wisdom, all that he 
seeth fit that they should have ; therefore we see that the Lord doth counsel 
in wisdom, according to that which is just and true." 



ELDER REY L. PRATT

I found that in the absence of your sons from the interior of 
Mexico, the Lord had magnified his servants who hold the holy priest- 
hood in that land, and the work has not merely maintained itself but 
it has grown. Those people, confronted with the difficulty of not being 
able to hold their services in rented halls, because the law of the land 
forbids, had gone to with their might, and although they have built but 
humble houses, yet without asking a cent from the Church, they have 
built in the time that I speak of, five magnificent little meetinghouses 
in which they meet. In one place where our people were forbidden to 
meet, two years ago, in a little branch where only ten resided, they 
took off their coats, made the adobes and built the house. I was in 
their place the other day. Since they built it they have baptized enough 
people so that we had eighty-five people present in that building. Four 
weeks ago Sunday, in the town of San Marcos — Brother Ivins will re- 
member that his early missionary experiences took him there a few years 
ago — they have builded a splendid house that will seat almost four 
hundred people, and we had at the evening session there nearly two 
hundred and fifty people gathered together. Our district president and 
his counselor gave addresses that I should he proud to have all the 
world hear, in defense of our position and the position of those people 
in that land. 

My time is very limited, but- 1 wish to recount some of the con- 
ditions with which they are confronted. There is a great upheaval in 
Mexico along all lines. There is an emancipation of the people. They 
are struggling. They are coming up from the dregs of degradation 
and slavery, and there is a great nationalistic spirit permeating the 
whole people. It is finding its way into the realms of the churches. 
There has been a great schism in the Catholic church. There has arisen 
a national Mexican Catholic church in opposition to the Roman 
Catholic church. The Mexicans are asking, all over the country: 
"Why should we look to Rome for leadership in the Catholic church? 
Why should we look to England for leadership in the Episcopal church ? 
Why should we look to the United States for leadership in all of the 
Protestant denominations?" They have asked our people: "Why 
should you look to the United States for leadership in the 'Mormon' 
Church ?" and our people have been invited, all over the country, there, 
to unite themselves with other factions of other churches to build up 
a Protestant Mexican church with leadership in their own land. 

Four weeks ago Sunday, there stood before two hundred and 
fifty of the Mexican people there, most of them members, but many 
of them not members, a young Aztec. When I first knew him he wore 
the costume of the country. He wore white factory pants, with sandals 
on his feet, and a white blouse. He could scarcely speak, intelligibly, 
the Spanish language. He is well educated now. He joined the Church 
some twenty-two years ago. He dresses well ; he knows the scriptures 
from cover to cover. He stood before the people and for an hour spoke 
to them of the principle of authority and brought up this proposition 
of the people and the suggestion that our people join with them in 
making a national church. Now he said, "Brethren, we must be con- 



130

sistent. The Lord does not know national limits in regard to his 
Church, and it has been his good pleasure to reveal his will to a prophet, 
who is as much our prophet as he is the prophet of the people among 
whom he was raised up, and that prophet is Joseph Smith. We hold 
the priesthood and we have seen its power, we have seen its mani- 
festations, we have seen our sick healed, we have been blessed by it and 
held together ; and all we have we know we owe to the restoration 
of that power that came to Joseph Smith. That is the power of God 
that will guide his Church, and we cannot make it any more Mexican 
than it is." 

Now, brethren and sisters, I was humbled, I was humiliated, but 
I was thankful, and I felt like saying : Maybe thousands have not come 
in, maybe nations have not been born in a day, but I thank God that 
the roots of the everlasting Gospel have struck deep in the soil of the 
hearts of the Lamanite people of Mexico. I feel sure that, come 
what may, there is no power in heaven or in hell that can uproot that 
power implanted in that land, and it will go on, just as that same power 
will go on with you. 

I feel just as sure as I feel that I live that this Gospel will thrive. 
It doesn't worry me what men think about whether we are going to 
succeed or not. I know that there are people in the Church that 
shouldn't be in the Church. I have met a lot of people that to me 
seem to be just like the foam that the waves beat up upon the shore 
and that then melts away. There is also a stratum that is in some parts 
and factions of the Church that is like the dregs of poison. But the 
vast body of the Church is true and is clear and is pure, and this 
work will go on to ultimate success and will remain. It is, and always 
will be, the power of God unto salvation. 

' This is my faith, this is my testimony, and I bear it humbly to you 
today in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER ARTHUR WELLING 

President of the North Central States Mission 

Very humbly, my brethren and sisters, and yet in deep gratitude 
and pride I bring you greetings from the missionaries and saints of 
the North Central States Mission. I should like my testimony to be 
to the youth of Zion, these young people who have been singing for us, 
many of whom I have the honor to know, and of whose acquaintance 
and friendship I am very proud ; and to the other thousands, perhaps 
tens of thousands of young people of the surrounding territory here 
who may be listening in to these services today. I recently calculated 
that in our mission, which is large geographically but small numerically, 
there are five million five hundred eighty-seven thousand and some 
hundreds of population, only twenty-five hundred and eighty-seven of 
whom are members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
That will figure out to about seventy-five thousand for each of our 
seventy-five missionaries. I think nothing more need be said in 



ELDER ARTHUR WELLING

emphasis of the plea that the other brethren have made for more 
missionaries. That is three-quarters as many as have been added to 
the Church per man for each of the six original organizers of the 
Church in the last hundred years. 

The young men and women who serve in the North Central States 
are full of faith and integrity. They love their work, they love the 
Lord, and I am certain as I live that the Lord loves them. "Oh ye 
who embark in the service of God," they would say if they had a chance, 
to all Israel, "see that ye serve him with all your might, mind and 
strength, that ye be found blameless before God at the last day." 

In the interest of time I should like the remainder of what I say to 
take the form of a testimony written for a friend long ago, which 
I believe will express, as well as anything else, what I would like to 
say here today. 

A TESTIMONY 

"Except the Lord build the house, they labor in vain who build 
it." (Ps. 127:1.) Obviously, what the Lord builds, they labor in vain 
who oppose. 

Mormonism is a house builded of the Lord. It is a going concern. 
It works. Nothing stops it. Its devotees are undaunted by disaster. 
Those who accept it are made better and happier. Those who oppose 
it, do so in vain. 

Consider the marvelous revelation of religious truth disclosed in 
the boy prophet's first great vision — its staggering significance to the 
world. Surely, except the Lord continue to build on that foundation, 
they labor in vain who attempt it. But if he does, who shall oppose? 

Later, clouds appear. Twenty thousand empty-handed refugees, 
their homes in ruins, their prophet slain, unsympathetic neighbors 
behind, only the comparatively hospitable wilderness before them, they 
turn their faces the more resolutely toward God and the boundless West. 
What happened? Did they quit and die as was hoped by some? Did 
God leave them to build alone ? For answer, in the midst of the desert, 
a thousand miles from civilization's late frontier, in "The country that 
God forgot," behold an empire rise. The Lord is with his people, 
helping to build his house. 

Nor is material prosperity Mormonism's chief evidence of divine 
approval. Far more important and conclusive are the moral and spiritual 
values it portrays. In days of shifting moral standards, "Companionate 
Marriage," and easy divorce, think of the stabilizing effect of the 
doctrine of marriage for eternity, and of the virtue and chastity with 
which tens of thousands of Mormon boys as well as girls kneel at 
marriage altars, in the temples of our God. Surely here is evidence 
of his building. It works. 

For keeping men always at their best, no merely human agency 
approaches, in effectiveness, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day- 
Saints. Those who accept and live its teachings' are better and happier. 

The missionary system of the Church, like the "quality of mercy," 
continues to "Bless him who gives and him who receives" its message.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



More and more the Book of Mormon is commanding the respect 
of investigators and vindicating its own divine origin. Opposition to 
the great truths for which it stands, has been and will continue to be 
in vain. 

For these and other reasons, I am proud to be a Mormon mis- 
sionary. 

My grandparents on my mother's side knew and loved the Prophet 
Joseph. My grandfather, Jonathan H. Holmes, a Mormon Battalion 
man, was mustered out of the service of his country, on the Pacific 
coast, in time to join his family and friends late in the summer of 
their first year in the valley of the Great Salt Lake. My mother was 
born in the old fort on Pioneer Square, in 1849. 

My father, Job Welling, was a handcart pioneer of 1856. A 
venerable patriarch of Alpine stake, hearing my father's name, once 
said to me: "I helped your father bury one of your brothers (by a 
former marriage) on the plains of Iowa;" adding significantly, "Be as 
good a man as your father." This challenge: "Be as good a man as 
your father," I like to pass on to other young men of the Church. 
Think it over. 

"Mormonism" is true. It is a nick-name for the restored Gospel 
of Jesus Christ. 

Joseph Smith was and is a prophet of the true and living God. 
So are his successors, including President Heber J. Grant. 

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints presents the same 
organization, the same Gospel doctrines, and the same authority to 
administer in the ordinances thereof, as characterized the primitive 
Church. 

It is God's house. He is building it. It will stand forever. 
To all of which I bear humble witness, in the name of the Lord, 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

Selection by the chorus, "The Lord shall be revealed," from "The 
Messiah," by Handel. 

Closing prayer by Elder Mark Austin. 

Conference adjourned until 10 a. m., Wednesday, April 9th. 



FOURTH DAY 



MORNING MEETING 

Conference reconvened at 10 o'clock Wednesday morning, April 

9th. 

President Heber J. Grant presided. 

The music for this meeting was furnished by the Ogden Tabernacle 
Choir, Lester Hinchcliff, director. 

The hymn, "How firm a foundation," was sung by the choir and 
congregation. 

Elder Frank Y. Taylor offered the opening prayer. 

The choir sang the "hymn, "If you could hie to Kolob." 

ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY 

An old darkey minister was about to address a congregation. He 
chose for his text: "Bressed am dey what expeks noffin, for dey 
shant be disappointed." I apply this to myself, for I certainly did not 
expect to be called on to address this congregation. President Grant 
has been so kind to me already, in permitting me to read my Centennial 
poem at a previous session, that I was not looking for any additional 
honor and pleasure. I am thankful for it, however, and esteem it a 
precious privilege to be not only a reader, but also a speaker at this 
great conference — the greatest one I have ever known. 

AN AGE OF WONDERS 

We are living in an age of wonders. Events and achievements 
that would have been deemed miraculous a hundred years ago, have 
become to us almost commonplace. Had we lived two centuries earlier, 
and expressed a belief that men would fly through the air like birds, 
or dive in the sea like fish, it would have provoked skepticism, if not 
prejudice ; would possibly have been regarded as bordering on witchcraft 
or a disposition to encourage it. 

ERRORS OF SUPERSTITION 

Two or three hundred years ago, in certain parts of New England, 
notably Massachusetts, if a poor woman was accused of witchcrati, 
she was put on trial in a most peculiar manner. They tied her to a 
plank and threw her into the water. If she sank she was innocent — 
which of course was a great comfort to her! If she floated they took 
her out and burnt her for a witch. 

A LAND OF LIBERTY 

But thank the Lord, we are past those bigoted and cruel times. 
We live in a day when men have the right to think — to think aloud and 
utter their thoughts, without being beheaded for it, or burnt at the 



134 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



stake. God be thanked for this Land of Liberty, for the freedom to 
worship him as conscience dictates — not the conscience of our neighbors, 
but of ourselves. I am proud of my country, proud to be an American 
citizen, and proud to be a Latter-day Saint. 

A STRAW IN THE WIND 

Speaking of wonders, I am reminded of an incident that happened 
right here, in this Tabernacle, a year or more ago. Elder B. H. Roberts 
was speaking, standing as I am now, just in front of the microphone, 
and I was sitting in the next seat below. He was rather husky. He 
always was a "husky," you know ; but this time the huskiness was in his 
throat. He cleared it once or twice, and then I reached to him a cough 
lozenge, and President Grant, from the seat above, did the same. Said 
Brother Roberts in a low tone : "I'm afraid I'll swallow them." And 
I, in a whisper — a whisper, mind you — replied: "Well, that's what 
we want you to do." And that whisper went all over the world. At 
least it went as far as the City Cemetery ; for a woman living near there 
said to me next morning: "I heard it over my radio. I heard what 
Roberts said, and I heard your whisper." That is only a straw, but 
it shows the direction of the wind. 

THE MARVELOUS WORK AND WONDER 

I repeat: We are living in an age of wonders. The wonders 
of science, invention and discovery; the marvels of steam and elec- 
tricity, the miracles of the telegraph, the telephone, the wireless and the 
radio — what are they but parts of the "marvelous work and wonder," 
predicted centuries before the birth of the Savior, and begun in this 
the Dispensation of the Fulness of Times? And strange to say, the 
most marvelous part of it all — that pertaining to the restoration of the 
Everlasting Gospel, with the powers of the Eternal Priesthood and the 
gifts of the Holy Ghost — is the part that the world overlooks and passes 
by as a thing of naught. 

THE SIGNS THAT FOLLOW BELIEF 

The Savior said to his ancient Apostles, and he has repeated it 
to his modern Apostles : "Go ye into all the world and preach the 
Gospel to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be 
saved ; he that believeth not shall be damned (or condemned) ; 

"And these signs shall follow them that believe. In my name they shall cast 
out devils ; they shall speak with new tongues ; if they drink any deadly thing it 
shall not hurt them. They shall take up serpents ; they shall lay hands upon the 
sick and they shall recover." 

I am a living witness to the fulfilment of this divine promise. These 
miraculous "signs" follow belief now, the same as in days of old. I 
have seen devils cast out by the power of the Priesthood. I have seen 
and heard manifested the gift of tongues and the interpretation of 
tongues. I have seen the sick healed with a touch, and have been healed 
myself by the laying on of hands, accompanied by the prayer and power 
of faith. 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY 



135 



A TYPICAL INSTANCE 

I will cite one instance, as typical of many. About twelve years 
ago I was in the town of Sandy, ten miles south of Salt Lake City, to 
deliver a lecture. Just before starting for the hall where I was to speak, 
I received an urgent message from the Bishop of the Ward, asking me 
to come and bless his daughter, a girl in her sixteenth year, who was 
lying at the point of death, having been given up by the family doctor, 
who declared that she could not live till morning. Taking another 
elder with me, I proceeded to the Bishop's home, gave the girl a blessing, 
and went on my way. Next morning, a telephone call from Sandy 
to my home in Salt Lake, informed me that a marvelous change had 
taken place in the young girl's condition. Before we blessed her, she had 
had no sleep for days and nights ; but no sooner had she received the 
administration, than she fell into a restful slumber and slept for twelve 
hours, waking up normal and so remaining. 

When the Doctor came next morning he was amazed. "Some- 
thing has happened here," he said. Yes, something had happened, 
indeed. "The prayer of faith" had "saved the sick," according to the 
promise of the Lord. 

Now, the Doctor had been right, from his viewpoint. Medical 
science had decreed that girl's death, or had decided that she could not 
live; and if some power greater than man's had not intervened, she 
would have died, according to the doctor's prediction. But something 
more powerful did intervene. A greater Science, than the science of 
medicine was brought to bear. The Spirit of the Lord said: "She 
shall live." And she did live. This girl who, twelve years ago, could 
not live till morning, is alive today, a happy wife and mother. I, 
myself joined her and her husband in eternal wedlock in the Temple 
of the Lord. 

I could relate many such incidents, if necessary. They are of 
frequent occurrence in the experience of the Elders of Israel. 'vThese 
signs" truly "follow them that believe," and they are only wanting 
where there is no faith, or not enough to justify them. 

TESTIMONIES OF THE TRUTH 

We call them testimonies — and testimonies they are ; for testimony 
means evidence. Anything that furnishes evidence that this is God's 
work, is a testimony concerning it. But healings are not the greatest 
evidence — they are but parts of a supreme testimony, greater than 
dreams, visions, prophecies, healings, tongues, and all other manifesta- 
tions combined. The greatest of all testimonies is the illumination of 
the soul by the gift and power of the Holy Ghost. How well I remember 
when it came to me. It showed me my place in the divine scheme of 
things; it showed me where I came from, why I am here, what is 
expected of me while here, and what awaits me in the Great Hereafter. 
That is the greatest thing that God ever did for me. This is my 
testimony, brethren and sisters, and I bear it here and now in the name 
of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen,

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ELDER CHARLES H. HART 

Of the First Council of Seventy and President of the Canadian Mission 

I am very grateful, my brethren and sisters, for all of the 
blessings of this conference and for all the blessings unto me personally 
and unto the missionaries over whom I have the honor of presiding. 

In this centennial year, the world may well ask, as never before, 
is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints of divine origin? 

The purpose of all intellectual research should be to discover the 
truth. Truth is defined by revelation to the Prophet Joseph Smith as 
"knowledge of things as they are, and as they were and as they are 
to come." And that "the spirit of truth is of God." 

Strictly speaking, truth has no degrees. A thing is either true or 
not true. To ascertain the truth we use evidence. While the word 
proof is sometimes loosely used as a synonym for evidence, yet more 
correctly it indicates the amount and quality of evidence which brings 
conviction to the mind. When evidence carries assent or conviction 
to the mind, the matter is said to be proved. However the matter 
may be in theory, the word proof is constantly used where the state of 
mind which is brought about by the evidence does not amount to that 
absolute certainty which is involved in a mathematical demonstration; 
it does not produce absolute or necessary truth as to which a supposition 
to the contrary is not and cannot be true. In investigations of every 
kind it is important that a correct estimate be made of the kind and 
degree of assurance of which the subject admits. Moral certainty, 
not mathematical demonstration, is the highest degree of assurance of 
which some truths admit. Even in the realm of the administration of 
the criminal law, where proof beyond a reasonable doubt is necessary to 
convict, mathematical certainty is not required. An abiding conviction 
to a moral certainty is sufficient. 

In the noted controversy during the middle of the last century, in 
which Lord Brougham, a distinguished Scotchman, who was once Lord 
Chancellor of Great Britain, answered another distinguished Scotch- 
man, Mr. David Hume, somewhat a skeptic in his views, who had 
claimed that proof of a miracle was impossible, Lord Brougham, 
although he thought his opponent's arguments went to the very denial 
vi the possibility of the proof of any revelation, and realizing the 
importance of combating such an idea, yet did not pretend to use 
more than moral evidence ; did not pretend to use mathematical demon- 
stration. 

Lord Brougham said : 

"The degree of excellence and of strength to which testimony may rise 
seems almost indefinite. There is hardly any cogency which it is not capable 
by possible supposition of attaining. The endless multiplication of witnesses, the 
unbounded variety of their habits of thinking, their prejudices, their interests, 
afford the means of conceiving the force of their testimony augmented ad 
infinitum, because these circumstances afford the means of diminishing in- 
definitely the chances of their all being mistaken, all misled, or all combining 
to deceive us." 



ELDER CHARLES H. HART 



137 



Along the same line Lord Brougham in his argument with the 
skeptic Hume further said : 

"Let any man try to calculate the chances of a thousand persons who come 
from different quarters, and never saw each other before, and who all vary 
in their habits, stations, opinions, interests, being mistaken or combining to 
deceive us, when they give the same account of an event as having happened 
before their eyes, these chances are many hundreds of thousands to one. 
And yet we can conceive of them multiplied indefinitely; for one hundred 
thousand such witnesses may all in like manner bear the same testimony; and 
they may all tell us their story within twenty-four hours after the transaction and 
in the next parish." 

In law, evidence is classified as direct and circumstantial, the 
latter meaning "the evidence afforded not by direct testimony of an eye 
witness to the fact to be proved, but by the bearing upon that of other 
and subsidiary facts which are relied upon as inconsistent with any 
result other than the truth of the principal fact." 

I am not disposed to place in contrast direct and circumstantial 
evidence since they are not naturally opposed. Both kinds have a 
legitimate place in the proof of disputed facts. It should be noted that 
while there is a popular impression that circumstantial evidence is 
unreliable or unsatisfactory, yet many jurists are strong in its praise and 
only a few overstate its probative force. Both kinds of testimony 
support the divine inauguration of Mormonism. 

Lord Chief Baron MacDonald, a jurist of England, said of cir- 
cumstantial evidence: 

"It is almost impossible for a variety of witnesses speaking to a variety of 
circumstances, so to concert a story as to impose upon a jury by a fabrication 
of that sort, so that where it is cogent, strong and powerful, where the witnesses 
do not contradict themselves, it may be evidence more satisfactory than even 
direct evidence, and there are more instances than one where that has been 
the case." 

The same judge said : 

"Where the proof arises from the irresistible force of a number of circum- 
stances, which we cannot conceive to be fraudulently brought together to bear 
on one point, that is less fallible than under some circumstances direct testimony 
may be." 

Sir Alfred Wills in the preface to the sixth edition of the book of 
his father William Wills on Circumstantial Evidence, refers to several 
cases in which a single penstroke no longer than an eighth of an inch 
was the critical test upon which important cases turned (such as 
Cresswell vs. (Jackson and Howe vs. Burckhardt, and other cases). 
A legal authority says that circumstantial evidence "although not in- 
variably so, is frequently superior in proving power to the average 
strength of direct evidence, and that under safeguards and qualifications 
which have been stated, it affords a secure ground for the most important 
judgments in cases where direct evidence is not to be obtained." 

The principles and the nature of the mental processes involved 
are the same in forensic inquiry as in the ascertainment of truth in 



138 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



any other department of human activity, and are made Use of con- 
sciously or unconsciously by everyone in the daily course of life, 
religious inquiries included. 

I have thus spoken particularly of the value of circumstantial 
evidence, not because I would minimize in the least the importance 
of the direct evidence in support of the divinity of the restored Gospel, 
but because I appreciate the great importance of circumstantial evidence 
in the consideration of the multitude of incidents making up the case 
of the- divinity of the restored Gospel. Many thousands of these items 
are to be found in the six volumes of Church history mentioned in 
this conference. 

The Prophet Joseph Smith was and always will be the most im- 
portant of the direct witnesses to the divine origin of the restoredi 
Gospel and priesthood. In comparing his experience with the experience 
of Saul of Tarsus, who saw the light and heard the voice, Joseph Smith 
said : 

"So it was with me. I had actually seen a light and in the midst of that 
light I saw two Personages, and they did in reality speak to me; and though 
I was hated and persecuted for saying that I had seen a vision yet it was true; 
and while they were persecuting me, reviling me, and speaking all manner of 
evil against me falsely for so saying, I was led to say in my heart : Why 
persecute me for telling the truth ? I have actually seen a vision ; and who am 
I that I can withstand God, or why does the world think to make me deny 
what I have actually seen? For I had seen a vision; I knew it, and I knew 
that God knew it, and I could not deny it, neither dared I do it; at least I knew 
that by so doing I would offend God, and come under condemnation." 

There are many other witnesses giving direct testimony as to one 
or another of the important items comprised in the coming forth of 
Mormonism. For instance, the Three Witnesses to the Book of 
Mormon each gave direct testimony to the facts declared by them. The 
Eight iWjitnesses speak of facts known to them by the physical senses 
of sight and feeling, and the muscular sense of weight. Joseph's parents 
and other members of the family gave direct testimony to other items. 
During the past century there have been hundreds of other witnesses 
giving direct testimony to facts which fit into and interlock with the 
case of circumstantial evidence in support of the divine restoration of 
the Gospel. Some of the most important of these testimonies were 
given under conditions making them more weighty than if given under 
the sanction of an oath. Some gave declarations admissible as evidence 
under rules of common law and the decisions of our state and federal 
courts, Utah included, as dying declarations made in consciousness of 
early approaching death, although not made in court nor under the 
sanction of an oath. 

Shakespeare must have well understood this rule of the English 
common law, for in the play of King John, his character, Melun, when 
mortally wounded and in fear of" early dissolution, in announcing the 
intended treachery of King Lewis and upon finding himself disbelieved, 
is made to exclaim : 



ELDER CHARLES H. HART 



139 



"Have I not hideous death within my view, 
Retaining but a quantity of life 
Which bleeds away even as a form of wax 
Resolveth from his figure 'gainst the fire? 
What in the world should make me now deceive 
Since I must lose the use of all deceit? 
Why should I then be false since it is true 
That I must die here, and live hence by truth?" 

For more than forty years I have had the opportunity of consider- 
ing many of the circumstances and incidents making up the great case 
of so-called Mormonism, in the light of the rules and principles laid 
down by the great jurists for the discovery of the truth and for the 
detection of error. Joseph and Hyrum went knowingly like lambs to 
the slaughter, sealing their testimony with their precious blood. 
Hundreds of their followers willingly gave their lives in the same cause. 

One non-Mormon writer asks : 

"Is it not beyond all reason that a lad, born of poor parents, devoid of any 
save the commonest education, too poor to buy books, should have accomplished 
what he did in less than forty years unless there was some great reason for it?" 

It required more than worldly wisdom to produce such books as 
the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants and the Pearl of 
Great Price, and to formulate a system of Church government which 
has been praised by non-members as having no superior on earth. 

From my consideration of the testimony and the circumstances that 
have come to me in support of this great cause which is now before 
the world of the divinity of the restored Gospel, I can truly say that 
I have an abiding conviction to a moral certainty of the truth of the 
claims of Mormonism, of the truth of its divinity. 

We have had many experiences in the Canadian mission indicating 
the blessings of the Lord, and what a great thing it is to know that 
God lives, and be able to appeal to him and to know that he answers 
our prayers. I found on my last trip a newly made convert whose 
right arm was withered. Her husband had fought in five of the 
fiercest battles of the great war and had evidently become shell-shocked 
and had wandered off. She was losing control of her children as well. 
Her prayer in connection with her baptism was that she might have the 
use of her right hand, that she might be able to support her children, 
that her husband might be restored to her and that she might regain 
control of her children. When I saw her a short time after her 
baptism she told me that when she went into the waters of baptism 
she felt that withered hand was being revivified. When she came out 
of the water she was able to wring out her wet clothes with the hand 
that had been useless for a long time. There was only the little finger 
that had not fully straightened but was much improved and she expected 
to obtain the full use of the same. She had regained control of her 
children and expected to find her husband. 

I rejoice in the many blessings of the Lord to us, and aside from 
any test such as might be applied to Mormonism by the jurist, it is my 
testimony in the light of the spirit of truth, the Spirit of the Lord, that 



140 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



God lives, that Jesus is indeed the Christ, and that this is the restored 
Gospel, and that the power of the living God to Joseph Smith, the 
prophet, has been conferred upon his successors and now is upon 
President Grant and his associates. May God help us to realize these 
truths and to act in accordance with the great case that has been partly 
presented in this conference and which abides in the hearts of the 
people, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER RICHAD R. LYMAN 

THE RESULT OF A BOY'S APPEAL. 

Who can imagine an event more romantic than for a boy hardly 
more than fourteen to go upon his knees and appeal successfully for the 
Creator of the universe to give him light and guidance? Strange as this 
may seem to many it was nevertheless the experience that came to Joseph 
Smith the founder of the Mormon Church. 

Of this experience he made a written record — that it was revealed 
to him at the age of fourteen that God had a great work for him to do ; 
that his name "should be had for good and evil among all nations, kin- 
dreds and tongues." (Pearl of Great Price, P. 51, Verse 33.) How, 
may I ask, without some sort of assistance, could a boy of fourteen have 
such an experience with such marvelous results ? 

Contrast that lone boy one hundred years ago with the multitudes 
that have here assembled, their hearts filled with thanksgiving and grat- 
itude, celebrating the hundredth anniversary of the organization of the 
Church. One boy then appealing; hundreds of thousands now listening 
in. 

"Behold, saith the Lord, I will proceed to do a marvelous work among this 
people, even a marvelous work and a wonder." (Isaiah 29:14.) 

Where can you find, or has there ever been, a work more marvelous, 
more wonderful? 

THE VIEWS OF AN ECONOMIST 

My purpose is to draw your atention to the words and views of Dr. 
Thomas Nixon Carver of Harvard, one of the greatest authorities on 
economics. In an article for "The Westerner" (April, 1930) he has 
expressed his views of the work and accomplishments of the Church, 
whose history began with the prayer of a boy. I urge that copies of this 
article be placed in the hands of our seminary students and missionaries. 
The demand for it has been such that "The Westerner" has provided an 
ample supply of reprints. 

Those who have difficulty in seeing things with the eye of faith will, 
I think, have their faith stimulated and supported by the scientific and 
logical presentation which Dr. Carver gives : 

FACTORS IN STATESMANSHIP. 
"Statesmanship," Dr. Carver says, "is the art of nation-building. One can 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 141 

study it in miniature in the early colonies on the Atlantic coast, and in the Mor- 
mon colonies in Utah." 

Imagine a boy of fourteen beginning an institution that commands 
any attention from one of the greatest political economists in the world, 
who says further: 

"I have long been interested in the Mormon polity. It throws a great deal of 
light on the art of nation-building." 

Is that a boy's work — nation-building? 

"It furnishes a laboratory for the study of the science of statesmanship. It 
is one of the most interesting and instructive experiments in the world." 

Is that a boy's work? The results are such that, as Dr. Carver 
says, "it is one of the most interesting and instructive experiments in 
statesmanship in all the world." Could anything but the power of God 
make such an accomplishment possible? 

Continuing, the economist says: 

"Themistocles, twitted because he could not play a musical instrument, re- 
plied that, although he could not fiddle, he could make a small city into a great 
and glorious one. The Mormon leaders did even better than that. They did not 
even have a small city to start with. They started with nothing and built a great 
and glorious commonwealth." 

Is not this marvelous? — even "a marvelous work and a wonder." 
(Isaiah 29:14.) 

THE MANNER OF ACCOMPLISHMENT 

"Such things," Dr. Carver continues, "can be accomplished in only 
one way." That is what I say — in only one way — and that way is with 
divine help, guidance and inspiration. 

"That way," Dr. Carver says, "is the economizing of man-power, since the 
economy of man-power is the key to the whole science of statesmanship, and of 
the whole art of nation-building." 

What could be more marvelous, what more wonderful, than for a 
boy unlearned, a boy with little opportunity to go to school, one whose 
youth was spent in poverty, to start an institution, which, from the 
point of view of the "science of statesmanship" and the "art of nation- 
building," commands the attention, the respect, the admiration, of the 
scholarship of the world? 

"It is only by economizing man-power that great masses of material can be 
moved, that rivers can be dammed, ditches dug, and land irrigated. It is only by 
economizing man-power that cities can be built, populations fed, and energy be 
spared for the arts and graces of life." 

"The Mormons did not even start with a mass of highly educated or skilled 
man-power." 

BOTH POOR AND UNEDUCATED 

Thanks to the professor for those good words — that the Mormons 
did not start with a highly educated people. You remember that when 
John the Baptist sent messengers to Jesus, asking, "Art thou he that 



142, GENERAL CONFERENCE 

should come, or do we look for another?" Jesus answered, go back to 
John and say, "The poor have the gospel preached to them." (St. Mat- 
thew, 11:3, 5.) Hear what the professor says: 

"The Mormons . . . started, as a general rule, with commonplace people. 
These people came from the backwoods, the prairies, and the mountains. From 
overseas, they came from peasant farms, from coal mines, and from work shops. 
While they were sturdy, hard-working people, they were not conspicuously gifted 
or learned." 

"Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another ?" asked 
the messengers from John of Jesus. His answer was: "Tell John the 
poor have the Gospel preached to them." 

"It was necessary for the Mormon Church," continues Dr. Carver, "to train 
its own people. They not only began with desert land and had to put every- 
thing on it, even water; they also had to start with relatively uneducated people. 
This double task of developing both land and people could never have been per- 
formed except by economizing such man-power as there was, and utilizing it to 
the nth degree." 

For me to say what the results are might not be very remarkable. 
For other members of the Church to say it, might not be remarkable; 
but for a great economist, not a member of the Church, to say this, in- 
dicates to me that here is the Church and Kingdom of God. 

Dr. Carver's strong words are: "The results were a marvel of 
statesmanship." 

A CLUE TO THEIR SUCCESS 

"Man-power, he says, "may be economized in three ways, and he 
analyzes the Mormon Church in these three ways : 

"First, man-power may be economized by cultivating sound, personal habits 
among the people. They who waste their substance in riotous living," says the 
professor, "are wasting more than wealth. They are wasting their own vital 
energy, their own man-power." 

If I could see him, I would take the professor by the hand and 
thank him heartily for the inspiring words that follow : 

"I have never found more sound and wholesome personal habits than among 
the Mormons. I never mingled with people who showed fewer signs of dissipa- 
tion. I have never studied groups of people who seemed better nourished and 
more healthful. I have never known people who took more pains to educate 
their children. These traits are a clue to the success of the Mormons as colon- 
izers and nation builders. 

"Man-power is also economized by discovering hidden talent and giving it a 

chance to function The world is always in desperate need of unusual 

talent. Any system of supervision or teaching which can discover latent genius 
and make it active is a factor in nation building. To discover hidden genius is 
better than to discover a hidden gold mine. 

THE POWER BEHIND IT ALL. 

"For some reason or other," he says — you know the reason and so do I — 
"the leaders of Mormonism had an almost uncanny" — (that is as strong a word 
as any scientific man could use for 'inspiration')— "the leaders of Mormonism 
had an almost uncanny power of discovering hidden talent. . . . The power to 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 



143 



save skill, talent, and genius from going to waste, is as near to divine wisdom 
as anything we are ever likely to know in this world." 

With the vocabulary to which science is limited, how could Dr. 
Carver more certainly stamp the Church with the mark of divinity? 

"Man-power," he says, "is also economized by cooperation, or by working 

together harmoniously It may have been the sheer necessity of the situation 

which forced the early Mormons to cooperate or starve. It may have been 
the bond of a common religion, it may have been superior intelligence and in- 
sight. Whatever the source, the result was good." 

A scientist cannot use the word "inspiration," nor say that people 
are guided by Divine Providence. He can use only those terms that refer 
to human forces or to the forces of nature. 

But we must acknowledge that there is a something which we call 
faith that comes into human hearts. It is a something like electricity, 
difficult to define, but, like electricity, tremendously powerful. It is the 
faith of the people of the Church in the message delivered by the Prophet 
which gives to this institution its active, thrilling, marvelous vitality.

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

The first organization of our women ifi the United States was the 
Relief Society of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
Today we have nearly one hundred thousand members in that or- 
ganization. A marvelous work and a wonder has been accomplished 
by them. 

We have a Mutual Improvement Association for the young ladies, 
which organization is now more than fifty years old, and has a member- 
ship of more than fifty thousand at the present time. 

We have a Primary Association that has been established for more 
than fifty years and that now has practically a hundred thousand 
members. 

INSUFFICIENT TIME 

I regret exceedingly that we have never had a conference — and 
I suppose we never will have — in which we are not limited for time 
as it draws near to the close. We make our calculations in our Mutual 
conferences, in our great Sunday School meetings, and the conferences 
of our other organizations, with the expectation that we can get through 
on time and be able to hear from all to whom we would like to listen. 
But almost without exception, towards the close of our meetings we 
are short of time. 

SISTERS TO SPEAK BRIEFLY 

I had hoped to give to our good sisters, the presidents of the Relief 
Society, the Young Ladies' Mutual Improvement Association, and the 
Primary Organization, at least ten minutes each in which to speak 
to us at this conference. But we will have to ask them to be content 



144 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



with the same amount of time that we have given to the mission 
presidents, namely, seven and one-half minutes each. 

We shall call upon Sister Robison of the Relief Society to be the 
first of these sisters to address us. 

SISTER LOUISE Y. ROBISON 

President of the Relief Societies of the Church 

My brethren and sisters : I pray that my Heavenly Father will 
give me strength that I can acceptably thank him for the great tribute 
that was paid to the women of our Church by our beloved prophet, 
Heber J. Grant. 

At this time the people of the Church have undoubtedly been 
reading the history of our early pioneers and of the founders of the 
Church, and I think the women of today cannot but feel impressed 
with what the women of the early days did. Their equipment was so 
poor compared with that which we have. Those women did not even 
have matches, nor coal stoves, nor gas stoves. There were no electric 
lights, no bath tubs, no sewing machines, nor any rubber goods. It 
took from one to three months to hear from loved ones left in foreign 
lands. 

A short time before the Church was organized that terrible battle 
of New Orleans, with its awful consequences, was fought two weeks 
after peace had been declared in Europe. Now we have so many con- 
veniences ; news from the world reaches us in a very few minutes. Our 
homes are so wonderfully equipped that it seems to me the world is 
thinking only of material comforts, and is standing on tiptoe for some- 
thing new. 

A few months ago I had the privilege, through the courtesy of 
President and Sister Moyle of the Eastern States Mission, of attending 
a street meeting on a busy thoroughfare in New York. Our fine elders 
stood forth, clean and intelligent, and offered to the people the plan 
of salvation. Very few cared for it. I thought at that time, if an 
inventor were to offer a new explosive, or something that could take 
life, there would be hordes and crowds of people around, and it would 
be broadcast everywhere. But when our elders offer the plan of life 
eternal it is not even recognized. 

The women of our Church appreciate the opportunity for service 
the Gospel has brought to us. As mothers in Israel we should be just 
as valiant in the cause of truth as were our former sisters. We may 
not have to face mobs, and be driven from our homes, but we should 
stand just as firmly for the principles of the Gospel as did those blessed 
sisters. We were told most vividly in our Relief Society conference 
how Sister Lucy Smith felt when her two beloved sons were brought 
home to her — martyred. We may not have to experience this kind of 
tragedy, but there are worse things than this, for the enemies of truth, 
honor and purity are using every means to destroy our children today. 
The path is clear for mothers to follow. We must live the Gospel in 



SISTER LOUISE Y. ROBISON 



145 



our homes in such a way that our children will have confidence in our 
teaching. We must feel that no effort is too great to teach our children 
that there is a Father in heaven, and that he does hear our prayers. 
Let us make it a real event in our family when a child is blessed or 
baptized. Make our little boys understand the importance and re- 
sponsibility of being ordained to the priesthood. We know the truth 
that has been given to us, and that it is only through our earnest efforts 
and our prayers that this message can be carried to the world that all 
may rejoice. 

I thank my Heavenly Father for membership in this Church. I 
thank him that I have a testimony that he has spoken through the 
Prophet Joseph Smith. I thank him for the leaders we have ; for those 
fine men holding the priesthood of the living God, who recognize 
women and who help them to accomplish what our Heavenly Father 
wishes them to do. 

I pray that we shall carry the spirit of this glorious conference 
to our homes, and that the whole Church and the whole world will be 
lifted up and blessed through this rich outpouring of the Spirit of the 
Lord. I ask it in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

SISTER RUTH MAY FOX 

President of the Young Ladies' Mutual Improvement Association 

My dear brethren and sisters: I surely stand before you at this 
moment as one of the least in the kingdom of heaven. To think that 
this day should ever come to me that I should be asked to speak at 
this great Centennial Conference is marvelous to me. 

The trend of the remarks in this conference seems to be the recall- 
ing of things of the past. I wonder if I shall be forgiven if I tell you I 
was born in one of the factory districts of England, that if my father 
had not received the Gospel of Jesus Christ I might have been there 
yet. Perhaps through my days I might have been working in the 
factory, as many married women did, striving to get food for my 
children. I might have had a husband who was not converted to 
prohibition. 

I might tell you that my mother died when I was a tiny baby; 
that I lived here and there, with any good sister that my father could 
prevail upon to take care of me ; that when we crossed the plains two 
families co-operated in one wagon, fourteen members in all. But we 
came with faith. 

As a little girl I came feeling that if I could look on the face of Pres- 
ident Brigham Young it was all the blessing I would ask. I might tell you 
that when I was married I felt if the Lord would give me enough 
bread and molasses to feed my children 1 should be content. For 
the benefit of the youth of Israel I will say that if President Young 
had asked me to abstain from eating any partcular kind of food or 
drink — I used to say if he had asked me to eat mush and milk all my 
days— I would have done it. That was because faith had been im- 
planted in my heart by my father. 



146 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



And so I am reminded of the words I have heard President Nibley 
say, "I do not forget the pit from which I was dug." I need not bear 
testimony in words. My whole life is a testimony to me that this is 
the work of God, and that God fulfils his promises and loves his 
children. If they will but walk in his paths they will be blessed forever. 

I desire to thank President Grant and the Authorities of the 
Church for this great blessing that has come to me. I desire to pledge 
to them my allegiance and my loyalty, and if it is not too strong to say, 
even to the death ; for the Gospel of Jesus Christ has always been the 
greatest thing in the world to me. 

Naturally I am interested in the youth of Israel, and, oh, if I had 
the voice of an angel, as has been quoted here at this conference, if I 
could only tell every young man and young woman what it means to try 
to be a Latter-day Saint, I would be so happy in doing it. I do pray 
that the blessings of the Lord will rest upon the fathers and mothers, 
the guardians and teachers of the youth throughout the Church. Oh, 
may they live the Gospel and set such an example before their children 
that they, the children, will delight to follow them. May God bless the 
youth of Israel that faith may grow and increase in their hearts, that 
Zion may rise and shine, as God has promised, and I ask it in the name 
of his beloved Son, Jesus Christ. Amen. 

SISTER MAY ANDERSON 

President of the Primary Association 

It is with great humility and yet with great pride that I stand 
before you today to represent the great army of the future, the children 
of the Latter-day Saints, and to say to President Grant, as his repre- 
sentative, that I appreciate this honor beyond all words in my power to 
express. 

The future lies before the great army of boys and girls of the 
Primary Association, numbering as President Grant has said, more 
than one hundred thousand. 

I was tremendously interested in the remarks of Brother Lyman, 
and as he talked I wondered if Dr. Carver comprehended the beauty 
of the work that is being done through the auxiliary organizations of 
the Church. I wondered if he knew of the thousands of women of the 
type such as he describes us to be who stand back of the General 
Authorities of the Church as helpers and aids in promoting in the world 
the establishment of the Gospel of Christ. 

The General Board of the Primary Association feels it is bound in 
honor to provide for the boys and girls of the Church the highest 
possible type of religious and moral education. We are the Religion 
Class of the Church, the class that is striving to put into the hearts of 
the boys and girls a feeling of love, a feeling of joy, a knowledge and 
understanding of their opportunities, that they in this organization may 
have every possible opportunity to begin in their early years to learn 
the grace and virtue of service. It is the hope of the General Board 



SISTER MAY ANDERSON 



147 



that the programs of the Primary Association will give every boy and 
girl an opportunity and a real chance to grow in service to the Church. 
We are trying to help them by producing such plans as will make the 
opportunity a real one, and as a General Board we are pledged to the 
Church in every possible way to provide a program which will promote 
a magnificent future for the Church of Jesus Christ. I pray that God 
will bless us in this effort and give us wisdom and understanding, that 
we may go forward to make the future as glorious as this conference 
has told us of the past. 

I must bear my testimony in concluding and say to you that I know 
the Gospel is true. My testimony is my greatest treasure, and that 
every boy and girl may have the same blessing I pray in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I am delighted to say that we have associated with us in our 
Religion Class work, and as our Church Commissioner of Education, 
a son of one of the loyal, true, faithful Latter-day Saints who was a 
member of the Council of the Twelve, Brother Joseph F. Merrill, a 
worthy son of a worthy father. We shall now hear from him. 

ELDER JOSEPH F. MERRILL 

Commissioner of Education 

My brethren and sisters : Unlike nearly all who have spoken, 
this call to address you is wholly unexpected to me. 

May I say that I too rejoice at the opportunity of witnessing what 
we have beheld since this great conference began. Many thoughts 
have passed through my mind as they have through yours. I have 
heard the brethren this morning speak of some of the evidences of this 
work. Those evidences have of course appealed to you, and there are 
others perhaps that appeal to you, that have not been mentioned. 

It is written in Joel 2 :28 that the Spirit of God would be poured 
out upon all flesh. Elder Whitney has said this morning that we 
live in a marvelous age. Our poetic prophet, Parley P. Pratt, sang in 
the first h^mn that is published in the hymn book, of the marvelous 
days that were about to be opened up. 

I wonder if there has been any evidence in what has transpired 
in the past one hundred years that bears testimony to the fulfilment of 
the prophecy of Joel that the Spirit of God would be poured out upon 
all flesh. In that super-excellent address of the First Presidency that 
was read by President Grant at the opening of this conference, an 
outline of the marvelous developments of the century was made. These 
developments have been referred to by other speakers of this con- 
ference as witnesses of the fact that the Spirit of God has been poured 
out upon all flesh, and I doubt that even Parley P. Pratt foresaw the 
glorious effulgence of this day of which he sung. 

Is this work divine? May I say to you that we believe of all the 



148 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



blessings that have come to us in the century the greatest is the 
witness that has come to us of the nature of our Father and God, 
the personal being that he is. With this work there came into the 
world at that time a conception of Deity that makes it easy for us to 
believe and to have faith and for us to serve. Has there been any 
philosopher, any philanthropist, any sociologist, that has ever proposed 
anything that has been as marvelous as the effect of the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ upon the lives of its members? If we are true Latter-day 
Saints we live on a plane of morality and virtue, of personal purity and 
of brotherly service to our fellowmen, that no other doctrine has yet 
lifted mortal up to. Is this an evidence of the divinity that has been 
in this Church and has been guiding it, and was in the beginning of 
its establishment? 

May I say that I should like to hold up to you what is another most 
outstanding physical evidence to the world of the divinity of this work, 
the Book of Mormon. It stands today, as it has stood for one hundred 
years, a challenge to the world and to the scholarship of the world 
and the archaeologists of the world, and it has met that challenge. If 
this book is true, then God is a personal being, there are angels in 
heaven that are personal beings, and they have visited the earth ; and 
if this book is not true Mormonism originated in a fraud. And so 
I say that to him who has not been granted faith to see and faith to 
believe, here is an outstanding physical evidence that challenges the 
reason of every sane individual, and we hold it up today as we have 
held it during the century as an evidence to all such and as testimony 
to ourselves that this Church is what it claims to be. And this, my 
brethren and sisters, is a testimony which is greater than any other 
physical evidence, I think, that we have that this work is of divine 
origin. Let us prize this incomparable book. But the greatest of all 
witnesses, as Elder Whitney has said this morning, is the witness 
of the Holy Spirit. This is an evidence that perhaps we cannot give to 
others, but we who have received it know it is the greatest, the surest, 
the most convincing. And my testimony to you at this time is that 
I do know, because I have received the witness of that Spirit and 
independent of any and all other evidence I declare to you that this is 
the Church and kingdom of God. 

May the Lord help us ever, all who have this witness* and others 
who believe, to show our faith and testimony by the manner of our 
service, by the character and the kind of lives we live, that we may 
be as a light upon a hill, I ask in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

The work of gathering statistics and recording history is of a 
trying nature. There is not the same inspiration in it that there is in 
going forth and proclaiming the Gospel. It is a type of work that, 
I have always been grateful to the Lord, has not fallen to my lot. I 
have a most wonderful admiration for the historian, the man who 
delves into things of the past : It is marvelous to me to contemplate the 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



149 



great labor that Brother Roberts has performed in compiling the history 
of the Church, also in writing the new history that has just been 
completed. I know of no more faithful, energetic, hard-working man 
to record history and to ascertain facts that we have ever had in the 
Church than Brother Andrew Jenson, and we shall be pleased to hear 
from Brother Jenson for ten minutes. 

ELDER ANDREW JENSON 

Assistant Church Historian 

My brethren and sisters : I have for many years looked forward 
to this day with fond anticipations — this Centennial Conference of the 
Church. I have hoped and prayed that I might live long enough in 
mortality to be present when the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints should be one hundred years old. I feel now like I could 
paraphrase the saying of Simeon of old when he had witnessed the 
child Jesus brought into the temple at Jerusalem. He said, "Lord, now 
lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, for mine eyes have seen 
thy salvation." 

I have been permitted to live to see this day, and to participate in 
this glorious Conference at the end of one hundred years of the 
existence of the Church, of which I became a member when I was eight 
years old. I may explain that my parents were among the first converts 
to the restored Gospel in that little country, Denmark, situated in the 
far-off north, toward the north pole. Being trained by my parents 
in the principles of the Gospel, I was baptized when I was old enough 
to be admitted to membership in the Church. 

I came to this land when I was fifteen years of age. From the 
time I was first able to read I became a student of Church history, and 
as a boy I read extracts from the history of the Prophet Joseph Smith 
as they were published semi-monthly in "Skandinaviens Stjerne," the 
Church organ of the Scandinavian Mission, and have been a student of 
Church history, from that time until the present. When I arrived in 
Utah, nineteen years after the original pioneers of Utah — after walking 
all the way across the plains from the Missouri River — I found that 
besides killing snakes and building bridges, I, as one of foreign birth, 
had many things to learn, among which was the acquiring of a knowledge 
of the English language. And not only did I have to study the language 
of my adopted country, but also the customs and habits of a new 
country. The Lord, however, was with me. I took hold of the task 
and did the best I could under the circumstances. After I had been 
here for some time I began to move about somewhat freely, with the 
English language moderately at my command. Then it dawned upon 
me that as I had been interested in the history of the Prophet Joseph 
and the history of the Church generally in my boyhood days in my native 
land, perhaps it would be a blessing for my country people to read 
the story of the great man and prophet who was the founder of this 
Church. And it became my privilege to write a brief history of Joseph 



ISO 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Smith, the Prophet, and to assist in publishing the first book that was 
ever printed in Utah in the Danish-Norwegian language. That was 
the history of Joseph Smith, in book form, issued even before a work 
of that kind was ever published by the Church in the English language. 
Prior to that time the Prophet's history had appeared in serial form 
in the columns of the early volumes of the "Deseret News" and the 
"Millennial Star." 

It has been my privilege to travel extensively in many lands and 
climes in the interest of Church history. I am exceedingly thankful 
to President Grant for the few words of commendation he gave me in 
introducing me to this great congregation. I have sometimes been at 
a loss to know exactly where I stood in the estimation of the General 
Authorities of the Church, because I have for many years been engaged 
in a labor that is perhaps only appreciated by a few and not by the 
masses of the people. It has been my privilege, my brethren and sisters, 
to travel something like 495,000 miles in the interest of Church history 
and as a missionary of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 
to the nations of the earth. It has been my privilege to visit all the 
missions of the Church excepting one, namely the South African 
Mission. When I traveled around the world for the first time, there 
was none of our missionaries in South Africa, and consequently I did 
not go there. 

In my historical studies and researches I soon learned that history 
is made up mainly from the acts of men and women, and that those 
who become converts to the true Gospel of Christ and are baptized, are 
organized, as a rule, into branches of the Church and that these branches 
are generally grouped into conferences, districts or missions. At home, 
the members of the Church, as we all understand, are grouped into 
wards, and the wards in turn are grouped into stakes of Zion. I have 
become convinced that it would be impossible for anyone to write a 
true and detailed history of the Church as a whole, without a knowledge 
also of the history of the various branches, conferences, districts, 
missions, wards and stakes of Zion ; this means a history of the 
settlements of the saints in their gathering places, as well as histories 
of the missions and their subdivisions abroad ; hence the necessity of 
extensive travels to read the sources of first-hand information. 

It has been my privilege to be a field man, gathering historical 
data, most of my life, and in going into all parts of the world, to follow 
in the tracks of missionaries who were laborers in the vineyard before 
me, to find out what they had done, gather up historical threads and 
weave them into history. 

After my long experience, I think that I am at liberty to say, from 
what I actually know, that there is no community at present in America 
or in any other part of the world that can consistently boast of so 
accurate a history of their movements and operations as can the 
Latter-day Saints. By making this statement, I refer particularly to 
the history of our settlements and our missions. It has been my lot 
to visit nearly "every nook and corner" of the Rocky Mountains and 
all the gathering places of the saints in the Great West, from Canada 



ELDER ANDREW J EN SON 



151 



in the north to Mexico in the south, besides visiting the so-called "waste 
places of Zion" in the East repeatedly. In my extensive travels, I have 
ever endeavored to gather historical data, and from my field notes I 
have written and compiled some six hundred manuscript volumes 
containing Church history in general, and histories of our missions and 
stakes, with their subdivisions, in detail, and also histories of the 
different auxiliary organizations of the Church, both at home and 
abroad. 

I have aged and my hair has turned gray, as you can see, while 
dedicating my best efforts to this work. Mormonism, however, means 
everything" to me. I, together with so many others, was brought to 
this land through the use of certain keys of the holy priesthood which 
were restored to the Prophet Joseph Smith in the Kirtland temple 
on that memorable third day of April, 1836, when, among others, Moses 
appeared and committed to the Prophet Joseph Smith the keys for the 
gathering of Israel. That accounts for the fact that about one-fifth 
of the entire Church membership are converts or descendants of those 
who hail from the Scandinavian countries, commencing with the fruits 
of the labors of Erastus Snow and those who came with him to the 
north countries in 1850. In listening to these missionaries from Zion, 
the blood of Israel in our veins asserted itself, for that blood is to a 
very great extent represented among the inhabitants of those lands ; 
and so, when Erastus Snow and his fellow-missionaries testified of the 
restored Gospel, a response was awakened in our hearts, telling us that 
we too were of the house of Israel. We seemed to listen to a familiar 
voice, which we understood and obeyed, for it was the voice of the 
true shepherd which the sheep recognized; and therefore we are here 
today. Israel in other nations has had a similar experience and thus 
a multitude of nations are represented in our glorious pageant which is 
now being given in this spacious tabernacle. 

Brethren and sisters, I feel that I would like to devote the balance 
of my time to completing the work to which I have devoted most of 
my life, because it is not yet completed; and if President Grant and 
my superiors in the priesthood will allow me to have "free rein" and 
back me in my labors, I promise that I shall continue my loyalty to the 
Church and to the priesthood and put forth the best there is in me as 
long as I dwell in mortality, to this end. 

There are many things that a real historian can see and understand 
which perhaps are not generally seen and comprehended by his con- 
temporaries, but which will be better understood and appreciated by 
future generations — perhaps hundreds of years hence. Some of us, 
Pioneers in new fields, must necessarily live ahead of our time, in order 
to accomplish work in the interest of yet unborn millions. 

May God bless us, my brethren and sisters, and help us to be 
faithful and true to whatever positions in the Church we have been 
called, or may hereafter be called to occupy, as we sojourn in the midst 
of the saints of the most high God. May God help us to be satisfied 
with our lot and positions, if we can be convinced that we are where 



152 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



God wants us to be, and where we can be of the best use to our fellow- 
men, according to the strength and ability with which we have been 
endowed. We may not always be in the limelight, or be engaged in 
work that at once is understood and recognized, but if we are doing 
that which our Heavenly Father has designed us to do while we 
dwell in mortality, we should be thankful and satisfied. These, at least, 
are my sentiments, and by them and by my reverence for God and 
his cause I am encouraged and strengthened in my endeavors to 
faithfully and diligently discharge the duties pertaining to the work 
that has fallen to my lot to do in life. 

May God bless each and every one of us, who are members of the 
Church, to be faithful and true to our God, to our religion, to the 
priesthood, to our co-religionists and to our fellowmen in general ; 
and may we have the desire and ability to honor any and every position 
in which we may be placed, and successfully carry the responsibilities 
entrusted to us, is my sincere prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir rendered the anthem, "Cast thy burden upon the Lord." 
Elder William T. Jack offered the closing prayer. 
Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock. 

AFTERNOON MEETING 

The closing session of the Conference convened at 2 o'clock Wed- 
nesday afternoon, April 9th. 

Practically every seat in the great auditorium and galleries of the 
Tabernacle was occupied. 

President Heber J. Grant presided. 

The Ogden Tabernacle Choir, under the leadership of Lestei 
Hinchcliff, furnished the music for this session. 

The choir and congregation sang the hymn, "For the strength of 
the hills we bless thee." 

Elder J. Robert Price, President of the Maricopa Stake, offered 
the opening prayer. 

The anthem, "Hallelujah, O praise ye the Lord," was rendered by 
the choir. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I very much appreciate the audience we have here today. I am very 
pleased indeed that our building is practically full at the last session 
of the conference. As a rule when we have held our closing session 
on a week day there have been a great many empty benches.

ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 

About one year after the organization of the Church, in a revelation 
to the Prophet Joseph Smith, the Lord Jesus Christ said: 

"And even so I have sent mine everlasting covenant into the world, to be 
a light to the world, and to be a standard for my people, and for the Gentiles 
to seek to it, and to be a messenger before my face to prepare the way before 
me. 

"Wherefore, come ye unto it, and with him that cometh I will reason as with 
men in days of old, and I will show unto you my strong reasoning." , 

"Wherefore, hearken ye together and let me show unto you even my 
wisdom— the wisdom of him whom ye say is the God of Enoch, and his brethren." 

From the testimonies that have been borne during this conference, 
ample evidence has been offered to show that the Lord has fulfilled in 
part at least this promise, that in the establishment of his Church he 
was establishing a standard for his people to seek unto and that would 
also attract the attention of the world. 

AN IMPORTANT PERIOD 

My soul rejoices with my brethren and sisters who have spoken 
during this great conference, for this glorious day, and I have lifted 
up my heart in praise and adoration of the Almighty for his goodness 
to give me life in this time. Had I been given the privilege to choose 
any period of all the glorious past I would prefer to be upon the earth 
today, in the year 1930, rather than any other period the world has ever 
known, because I believe we are at the dawn of far more glorious 
things than have ever been known in the history of all the glorious past. 

TESTIMONIES REGARDING OUR STANDARDS 

Men are bearing witness to the value of the standards of the 
Latter-day Saints. Many quotations have been made during this 
conference from eminent authorities who have been making a study of 
the lives of the Latter-day Saints. I want to add one from a critic 
who has already been quoted by one of the brethren, and who, not- 
withstanding his criticism, acknowledges as he examines the rise of 
various churches in America that of all of them there is only one that 
has succeeded. And he asks why has this one succeeded when others 
have failed ? He answers : 

"Mormonism is the American mind at last hitting on the solution. The 
solution is, briefly, a co-operation of energized believers working in the name 
of God for an earthly kingdom that will persist into eternity. In the half 
century before the Civil War America was frecked with experimental societies 
struggling to find this formula. Mormonism found it and has endured." 

Testimonies of men who are observing us indicate that not only 
are our standards appealing to members of the Church, but to those 
who are not of us. In the establishment of this work the Lord 
declared that only the truth could survive, and. that everything that 
could be shaken would be shaken.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



CHURCH PROGRESS IN AGE OF GREATEST ENLIGHTENMENT 

In looking into some late government statistics I observe that of 
the twenty-three leading denominations in the United States six of 
them in the period of the last ten years have shown a loss in membership, 
and of the twenty-three not one of them shows a greater percentage 
of growth than the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
While it is computed that there are twenty-five thousand vacant Pro- 
testant churches in the United States, this Church has been through its 
greatest building program in the period of the last three years. It 
is marvelous when we think of it also happening in the age of the 
world's greatest enlightenment. That inspired document which Pres- 
ident Grant read, the utterances of the First Presidency, called our 
attention to the marvelous changes that have occurred in the period 
of one hundred years. Man's manner of thought, of travel, every phase 
of human_actiyity, has been so touched by the inventions of science, 
that we live in a marvelous age. More light and knowledge has come 
into the world during this period of one hundred years than all the 
ages of time combined preceding it. And in the light of all this blaze 
of knowledge Mormonism thrives and flourishes as never before. The 
greatest ally the Mormon Church has is modern science. 

GOSPEL TRUTHS HARMONIZE WITH SCIENTIFIC TRUTHS 

We have no quarrel with any of the truths of science. We have 
perhaps still some dispute with some of the theories of men who are 
attempting to support their theories by the application of scientific 
truths, but we have no quarrel with the truths of science. They stand 
in perfect harmony with the truths of this restored Gospel, and all 
truth naturally will be akin and united. Each truth, whether it comes 
from science or from religion, will be united harmoniously together. 
And then when I think of this great flood of light and truth, I aski 
why did this come into the world in this age? Were there not wise 
men before 1830? Were there not great characters who have appeared 
upon the pages of history, and yet they were not able to solve the 
mysteries, unlock the door, and bring to light the wonderful things 
that this age has known? Why? I can only answer with simple, 
trusting, faith and belief, that the reason this flood of light and truth 
has come into the world in this age is because God willed it so. These 
great truths were known to him. Not a thing that man knows but was 
known of God long beforehand. The secret was kept until the day 
came when the door was opened. The Spirit of God, as was said this 
morning, has been poured out upon all flesh, and men have seen visions 
and have dreamed dreams and have unlocked the mysteries of God 
and have brought to light and knowledge these marvelous truths that 
are God's means of helping to promote the establishment of his religious 
truths and to prepare the world for his glorious coming. 

God is not only moving among this people, but he is operating 
among the nations of the earth. I rejoice in the accomplishments of 
the past. Our fathers and mothers have stood trials, persecutions. 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 



155 



mob violence, and difficulties, the like of which perhaps no other 
age has known. But they have endured it. They have stood like 
beaten anvils in all these trials, and remained true, and have given us 
a Church conceded by men to have the right to exist. 

THE GLORIOUS FUTURE 

Now what shall we do? Our sacred duty is to stand by the fires 
that have been kindled, keep them ablaze that they shall never die,, 
that they shall never perish. This is the glorious age of truth. There 
are yet conflicts that will go forward. Battles? Yes, struggles. But 
in the finality of each struggle there shall come the day of the triumph 
of truth. For this is the age when truth shall be triumphant and 
victorious, error, darkness and superstition, whether in the Church or 
in the state, shall perish, for this is the age for the triumph of truth, 
and I rejoice in it. 

As I look f orward to the future, glorious as the past has been, I see 
more glorious things before us. You sons and daughters of Joseph 
who was sold into Egypt, driven out from the midst of his brethren — 
in his isolation God was with him and raised him up to be the Savior 
of the whole house of Israel — so you children of Israel, you Latter-day 
Saints, sons of Joseph and of Ephraim, though you too were cast into 
the wilderness, driven away, in your isolation God has been with you. 
He is preparing to bring you out of your isolation, even as he did 
Joseph, to glorify you and to make you the saviors of the whole house 
of Israel, the light of the world. 

THE TIMES OF THE GENTILES 

In the document President Grant read, you listened to the scripture 
from the forty-fifth section of the book of Doctrine and Covenants, 
wherein the Lord Jesus Christ promises that though Israel was widely 
scattered she should be gathered again. But the statement is made that 
Israel, so far as the Jews were concerned, were to remain in theiir 
scattered condition until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled, and 
that the times of the Gentiles began with the dawn of this Gospel 
dispensation, and that that generation should see the close of the times 
of the Gentiles. 'What follows afterwards ? I am not able to determine 
the exact hour or period, but we have concluded from our Book of 
Mormon method that a generation is approximately one hundred years. 
It may be more. But we have every reason to believe that we are 
coming to the close of the period of the times of the Gentiles, and then 
dawns a new day. It does not imply that the Gospel shall necessarily 
be taken from the Gentile nations ; it may remain there, and shall until 
all who are among them of Israel shall be gathered up and until our 
work is accomplished among them. Then cometh the day of Israel. 

The Lord said, through Luke, that the Jews should fall by the 
edge of the sword and should be led away captive into all nations, and 
that Jerusalem should be trodden down by the Gentiles until the times 
of the Gentiles is fulfilled. Jerusalem was trodden down until General 



156 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Allenby's army marched into Jerusalem and broke the power that had 
ruled over the land and the destinies of that people for ages. 

THE DAY OF ISRAEL 

And I cannot help but believe that God is working with the rulers 
of nations, even the rulers of Great Britain, for they were inspired to 
name a Jew, Dr. Samuels, as the first ruler in nearly two thousand 
years, who has had authority and dominion over the Holy Land, who 
is a descendant of those to whom God gave the land originally. This 
all indicates that the time has come for this branch of the house of 
Israel. Their day is at hand. Many years ago while doing missionary 
work in Montana I was given to understand by the whispering of the 
Spirit, as I wondered why the Lamanites had not been brought into 
the Church at an earlier period — the Lord made known to me that 
there were many things that he had to do for them before they were 
prepared to accept the Gospel message. I believe that the things the 
Lord had in mind are being accomplished and that their day dawns 
also. I was impressed with it on that memorable Christmas morning in 
1925 in South America when Brother Wells, Brother Pratt and I knelt 
in that beautiful grove of weeping willow trees on the banks of the 
Rio de la Plata and dedicated the land for the spreading of the Gospel, 
and the Spirit of the Almighty was upon us. We were made to know 
that the Gospel message would find thousands who had the blood of 
Israel in their veins in South America. Then we saw the day when 
it would go to the fifteen million of Father Lehi's children who are in 
that land, and that the .shackles, politically, would be broken, the day 
of retribution would come, the day of deliverance, and that they 
would come into a full realization of the promises of the Almighty. 
For, for that very purpose, we read in the third section of the book of 
Doctrine and Covenants, was the Book of Mormon given, to bring them, 
the Lamanites, to a knowledge of the truth. 

THE LAND OF ZION 

I bear witness to you that God is moving in South America, and 
that the day will come when it will be as the prophet declared, a land 
of Zion — yes, the land of Zion for this branch of the house of Israel ; 
while North America becomes the land of Zion to Joseph's children of 
Ephraim. And God will move the leaders of the nations to prepare 
the way for it all. 

CHURCH AND STATE 

The great struggle for religious liberty that is going on in Mexico 
is also on in South America. Within the last five years two great nations 
have established absolute separation of Church and state, and others are 
struggling to that end. It will come. No power can stay it. The 
theory that the great dominant church there has, that its head has 
the right to rule over the Church and state, (and within the last year 
he has ascended unto that position, wherein he is now king and also the 
head of the church) is not the spirit of the democracy of South America, 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 



157 



nor is it the spirit of the democracy of North America or Mexico. 
It may be a lingering symbol of that which was once in Europe, but that 
order of things cannot live in this land, for this is the age of the, 
separation of the Church and the state. Yes, there will come a time 
when it shall be united again, but not under any earthly man. I believe 
that the Lord God Almighty is working not only in this Church but in 
this nation. Yes, this is the beginning of the realization of Daniel's 
dream. But I firmly believe too that God, as our scriptures very clearly 
teach, both the Book of Mormon and the Doctrine and Covenants, 
raised up this mighty nation of the Gentiles, and that his hand has 
been in it. He was with the patriot fathers who laid its foundation. 
He sustained them in their struggles. He was with Lincoln. He has 
carried the work on by his power, and men have acknowledged God 
as the King of the land. And so I believe when he comes whose right 
it is to rule and reign he will come as King of kings, and that is 
politically, and that he will be Lord of lords, and that is in his Church. 
I believe that when he comes to rule and reign there will be a union 
of Church and state under him whose right it is to rule and reign. 
But never has that right been given to a mortal man. 

We are going forward in preparation for that time. This great 
government is going forward in its holy mission to establish the 
principles of righteousness in government. It is God's work. It is 
rolling forth and it is teaching the nations of the earth and preparing 
them for the order of things when he shall come. It was but a prophecy 
of that which in time will be, when the Lord Jesus Christ rode into 
Jerusalem as a king. They strewed their palm branches and hailed him 
king. That is what he shall be when he comes to rule and reign, and 
the people shall accept him and be glad for his coming. 

god's purposes to be fulfilled IN RUSSIA 

I am sure also that God is moving in Russia. Much as we are 
disturbed over the tyranny and the oppression that is waged against 
religion in that land today, it is not a new thing, for that has been the 
order for ages. But I oan see God moving also in preparing the 
way for other events that are to come. The field that has gone to 
wild oats needs to be plowed up and harrowed and prepared for a new 
seed. So in Russia. It may seem appalling to us, but it is God breaking 
up and destroying an older order of things, and the process will be 
the accomplishment of God's purposes within a very short period of 
time, which normally may have taken generations. But that people 
will come back, for I bear witness that there are thousands of the blood 
of Israel in that land, and God is preparing the way for them. 

SAVIORS OF THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL 

Yes, our cousins, the Jews, whom we have sympathized with, whom 
we have loved from the beginning of this Gospel dispensation — whether 
you know it or not God is moving in your interest. This work is the 
hub and the center about which all the great movements are going 
forward among the nations of the earth. God is in it and it will triumph, 



158 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



and the Liatter-day Saints will come out of their isolation and become 
the saviors of the whole house of Israel ; not so much to feed them 
bread as Joseph did, but a more precious bread, the bread of life, the 
spiritual things that are of greater value. 

THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF GOD'S PURPOSES 

I bear witness to you Latter-day Saints that all we need to do is to 
keep the commandments of God. His promise was that if we would 
listen to his counsels we would never cease to prevail until the 
kingdoms of the world were subjugated under the Lord Jesus Christ; 
and the earth will be given to the saints and those who are worthy 
of it, to possess it forever and forever. All we need to do is to adhere 
to our teachings, and these standards of living will solve every 
problem that now vexes the world. In our making progress let us not 
lose sight of the goal, neither become discouraged. We are about 
to enter into a new era, a new period, more glorious, more wonderful. 
All we need to do is to serve God and we shall see his salvation going 
forward to the accomplishment of his holy purposes, for Zion shall 
arise and. shine, and the ends of the earth shall come unto her to learn 
of her ways and walk in her paths, for she is destined to be the light 
of the world. I know it and bear witness of it, and ask God to send 
us home rededicating our lives and all that we have to keep the fires 
burning, to carry on and be prepared when God is ready for the con- 
summation of his holy purposes. 

DEAD BUT NOT SILENCED 

We sorrow at the necessity of the death of the Prophet, but we 
glory that he was willing to die and did die a martyr and sealed his testi- 
mony with his blood. It was undoubtedly essential. As has been said by 
an eminent authority who has written a life of Christ, "We lend ears 
only to voices which cry out from the tombs, and reserve our scanty 
capacity for reverence for those whom we have assassinated. The 
only truths that remain in the fleeting memory of the human race 
are those written in blood. All the prophets who have ever spoken 
upon the earth were insulted by men, and men will insult those who 
are yet to come. We can recognize prophets by this: that smeared 
with mud and covered with shame they passed among men, bright- 
faced, speaking out what was in their hearts. No mud can close the 
lips of those who must speak, even if the obstinate prophet is killed. 
They cannot silence him. His voice, multiplied by the echoes of his 
death, will be heard in all languages and through all the centuries that 
are to come." 

God vindicate his truth, as I am sure he will, and keep us worthy 
to be in the ranks of the victorious in the greater day that is to come, 
I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 159 



ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 

Of the First Council of Seventy and President of the 
Temple Block Mission 

I am happy to be present at this meeting after my lectures at the 
University of Utah today. We have registered at the State institution 
over three thousand of the youth of the State ; and I have a pride in the 
boys and girls, for they have faith in life; they have their dreams and 
hopes, and they will develop into fine citizens and will carry on the in- 
stitutions of civilization which their fathers and mothers have founded. 
They will learn as we all learn that they will not go far without being 
brought face to face with the commanding figure of Jesus Christ, the 
Redeemer of the world. They will see the Creator of divine life in him ; 
a truth that is linking together the peoples of the world into an immortal 
purpose. 

In this day of mad rush and strife ; when noise and glitter influence 
the human mind ; this mighty rushing to and fro ; this clash of many 
strifes ; this feverish hastening towards some unknown goal ; Jesus 
Christ gives the intelligible answer in revealing the infinite possibilities 
of the human soul. The leaven of his doctrine is ever working in the 
social body of which we are part, and his influence leads the van in 
every forward movement for the welfare of mankind. It is a plain fact 
of history that the influence of Jesus Christ upon the world has opened 
up vast tracks of spiritual opportunity of which the wisest men have 
never dreamed. He has uplifted and enriched the common life; he has 
filled the soul with immortal hope. He has brought peace to the deso- 
late heart ; he has made the quest for truth a divine adventure. He has 
made known the abiding joy of service for others; and most of all he 
has justified the upward reach of man, as he struggles from lower to 
higher things, which shows that Christ brings life and light into the 
hearts of men. 

"Blessed are they who do hunger and thirst after righteousness, for 
they shall be filled." These are the words of our blessed Savior; and 
as you think of them, you will recall the wonderful discourse of Jesus 
with the woman of Samaria by Jacob's well. He tells the woman about 
the "living water," which he can give to all who ask for it. "Whoso- 
ever drinketh of this water shall thirst again . . . but the water I shall 
give him shall be a well of water, springing up into everlasting life." 
These words are life-giving to us all ; and when I think of them, I think 
of the ideals we are standing for today. 

We have with us on this great occasion Miss Ruth Pyrtle, head of 
the National Educational Association, who will be introduced to you 
by President Grant. I should like to say to Miss Pyrtle that we hold 
sacred above all else the names of God the Father and Jesus Christ, our 
Lord and Savior. It was Jesus who taught : "Blessed are the poor in 
spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven." The doctrines of Christ 
are the living waters of our lives. God be praised for them. May we 
appreciate them.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



As I contemplate them, I think of many of the world's great his- 
torical movements, among which are the establishment of the govern- 
ment of the United States and later the restoration of the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ and the establishment of his Church by divine authority. 
Then the gift to the world of the Book of Mormon. It is a history of 
the religious development of ancient Israel on the American continent, 
and is a holy book. 

First, as to the government of the United States. Our govern- 
ment was founded by inspiration, and the constitution of the United 
States was written as an expression of the freedom of the ages; a 
freedom that had been worked out and bled for by a people who looked 
always to God. 

When the Pilgrim fathers first set foot on the soil of America, they 
wrote this divine statement concerning their object and ideals of gov- 
ernment. 

"In the Name of God, Amen. We, whose names are under written, the loyal 

subjects of our dread Sovereign, King James, by the grace of God, Great Britain, 
France, and Ireland, King, Defender of the Faith, etc. 

"Having undertaken for the glory of God, and advancement of the Christian 
faith, and the honor of our king and countrie, a voyage to plant the first colonies 
in the northern part of Virginia, doe, by those presents, solemnly and mutually, 
in the presence of God, and one of another, covenant and combine ourselves to- 
gether into a civil body politic, for our better ordering and preservation and 
furtherance of the ends aforesaid ; and by virtue hereof, to enact, constitute, and 
frame such just and equal laws, ordinances, acts, constitutions, offices, from time 
to time as shall be thought most meet and convenient for the general good of the 
Colonic Unto which we promise all due submission and obedience. In witness 
thereof, we have here unto subscribed our names at Cape Cod, the 17th of 
November, in the year of the reign of our sovereigne lord. King James of Eng- 
land, France, and Ireland the eighteenth, and Scotland the fifty-fourth, Anno 
Domini, 1620." 

These great ideals, the Mormon people have ever striven to 
live up to, and only recently has a noted American scholar declared that 
the people of Utah — the Mormons — stand for the noblest ideals of free 
government. 

Then came the founding of the government of the United States, 
the culminating event in a sense of the establishment of free institu- 
tions. This Government was founded by the inspiration of God, for 
the founders prayed for inspiration, and they were inspired. When 
the members of the First Continental Congress convened at Carpenters 
Hall in Philadelphia, they turned to God for divine help. The Reverend 
Mr. Duche was called upon to pray one morning, and in his supplica- 
tions to God, he said: 

"O Lord, our Heavenly Father, high and mighty King of Kings, Lord of 
Lords, who dost from Thy throne behold all the dwellers upon the earth, and 
reignest with power supreme and uncontrolled over all kingdoms, empires and 
governments, look down in mercy, we beseech Thee, upon these American States 
who have fled to Thee from the rod of the oppressor, and thrown themselves upon 
Thy gracious protection, desiring to be henceforth dependent only upon Thee. 

"To Thee have they appealed for the righteousness of their cause. To Thee 
do they now look up for that countenance and support which Thou alone canst 
give. Take them, therefore, Heavenly Father, under Thy nurturing care. Give 



ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 



161 



them wisdom in council and valor in the field. Defeat the malicious designs of 
our cruel adversaries. Convince them of the unrighteousness of their cause, and 
if they still persist in their sanguinary purpose, O let the voice of Thine own 
unerring justice, sounding in their hearts, constrain them to drop their weapons of 
war from their unnerved hands in the day of battle. 

"Be Thou present, O Lord of Wisdom, and direct the Council of the hon- 
orable Assembly. Enable them to settle things upon the best and surest founda- 
tion, that the scene of blood may speedily be closed ; that order, harmony and 
peace may effectually be restored, and truth and justice, religion and piety, pre- 
vail and flourish amongst Thy people. 

"Preserve the health of their bodies, the vigor of their minds. Shower down 
upon them, and the millions they here represent, such temporal blessings as 
Thou seest expedient for them in this world and crown them with everlasting 
glory in the world to come. All this we ask in the name and through the merits 
of Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our Saviour. Amen." 

After we gained our independence, and later had written the con- 
stitution of the United States, our government was organized with 
George Washington as president of the new Republic. With the advent 
of the government of the United States came many new movements in 
the history of mankind. Upon this continent was found a people whom 
Europeans designated as Indians. They are of interest to us in that 
their forebears were Jews from Jerusalem. A great and enlightened 
people they had been, and on this continent they built up a civilization 
which today is the wonder, of the world. According to Charles Eastman, 
a full blooded Sioux Indian, we have these words concerning the re- 
ligion of the Indians: 

"The original attitude of the American Indian toward the Eternal, the 'Great 
Mystery' that surrounds and embraces us, was as simple as it was exalted. To 
him, it was the supreme conception, bringing with it the fullest measure of joy 
and satisfaction possible in this life. The worship of the 'Great Mystery' was 
silent, solitary, free from self-seeking. It was silent because all speech is of 
necessity feeble and imperfect ; therefore the souls of my ancestors ascended to 
God in wordless adoration. . . . Among us all men were created sons of God and 
stood erect, as conscious of their divinity. . . . Being a natural man, the Indian 
was intensely poetical. 

The solitary Communion with the Unseen which was the highest expression 
of our religious life is partly described in the word HAMBEDAY, literally 
'Mysterious feeling,' which has been variously translated as 'fasting' and 'dream- 
ing.' It may better be interpreted as 'consciousness of the divine.' 

"The first 'Hambeday' or religious retreat marked an epoch in the life of 
the youth, which may be compared to that of confirmation or conversion in 
Christian experience. Having first prepared himself by means of the purifying 
vapor bath, and cast off as far as possible all human or fleshly influences, the 
young man sought out the noblest height, the most commanding summit in all 
the surrounding region. 

"Knowing that God sets no value on material things, he took with him no 
offerings or sacrifices, other than symbolic objects, such as paints and tobacco. 
He appeared before the Great Mystery. . . . Sometimes he would chant a hymn 
■without words, or offer the ceremonial pipe. In this holy trance or ecstasy, the 
Indian mystic found his highest happiness, and the motive power of his existence. 

"Then he came down from the mountain and again entered the vapor bath 
to prepare himself and be clean before he met his fellow men. 

"It was the duty of the parents to direct their children and to assume the 
priestly power. The Indian was a religious man from birth. It was supposed 
that the mother's spiritual influence counted for most. The mother's first lessons 
were Silence, Love, Reverence. Later she added generosity, courage, chastity. 



162 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



"As a child," says Eastman, "I understood how to give; I have forgotten 
that grace since I became civilized. . . . The fruits of worship are Self Control, 
True Courage, Endurance, Patience, Dignity, and Reverence. 'Guard your tongue 
i:i youth' said the old Chief Wabashaw. 

"The moment that man conceived of a perfect body, supple, symmetrical, grace- 
ful, and enduring — in that moment he had laid the foundation of the moral life." 

The coming forth of the Book of Mormon is a great event in his- 
tory, for it tells about the religious teachings of the forefathers of the 
American Indians. It is a book of holy scriptures, and it contains the 
word of God to his people. Prophets there were in those days, and 
the Book of Mormon tells us that these divinely and inspired men taught 
the Kingdom of God and its Coming : The Fatherhovd of God and the 
infinite Value of the Human Soul; and the Higher Righteousness and the 
Law of Love. These are all to be obtained by obeying the laws and 
commandments of God, which are fundamentally, Faith in God the eter- 
nal father, and in his Son Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost ; the prin- 
ciples of repentance and holy baptism by immersion by one having di- 
vine authority ; and the conferring of the Holy Ghost by the laying on 
of hands by one holding the Priesthood of God. 

So we are this day celebrating great events in the world's history. 
The Gospel of Jesus Christ will never go from the earth ; it is safely 
lodged in the hearts of men. The Gospel will save the world from 
degradation and sorrow ; from wrong and ignorance. Our Government 
of the United States will also live. It has already been an inspiration 
to the world in ideals of liberty and freedom. It will continue to be so 
if we will but try to live up to the ideals of its founders. This govern- 
ment says to all peoples : Come, you are children of God. Here is the 
world of God. Enter. There shall be no king; no subject; no master. 
There shall be no lord, no vassal. All are free to worship God accord- 
ing to the dictates of conscience. 

One hundred years ago, a celebrated French savant, the Abby 
Genty, published an essay on the Result of the Discovery of America 
by Europe. The essay closes with the words : "The independence of 
the Anglo-Americans is the event most likely to accelerate the revolu- 
tion which is to renew the happiness of the world. In the bosom of this 
new nation are the treasures which are to renew the world." He names 
the relief to crowded Europe as one of the blessings which is to come 
to mankind : the emancipation of slaves, the end of conquest ; and the 
conversion of the world to Christianity. 

The Abby Genty was right. Here will the world find a govern- 
ment of the people and for their eternal good ; here will people look 
for their Zion — the kingdom of righteousness. The day may be far 
off ; it may be near ; but the Zion of the Lord will be established on this 
continent, and the kingdom of God shall reign in the hearts of man. 
For these ideals we are striving. Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

Wje are honored in having with us today Mrs. Ruth Pyrtle, who 
is the head of the National Educational Association of America. I

will say for her benefit that the Latter-day Saints have always been 
interested in education Immediately upon arriving here the early pio- 
neers established schools, and last year the Church expended from the 
tithes of the people on education alone over $918,000. It is now my 
great pleasure to introduce the President of the National Educational 
Association. 

MISS RUTH PYRTLE 

President of the National Educational Association 

President Grant and friends : I assure you that I deem it a great 
honor and privilege to be invited here today, an honor of a lifetime. 
Our association is greatly honored in that you let me come here as a 
representative of that great association and bring to you, this educational 
body, the greetings of the National Educational Association, the largest 
organization of teachers, of educators, not only of the United States 
but of the world. 

I have listened with great interest this afternoon to these splendid 
addresses, and I feel quite at home, because it seems to me that the 
work of this hundredth anniversary meeting and the purposes that this 
great Church has had all through the years are common with the rest 
of the people of the world who are working for the progress of the 
human family. And so I feel like addressing you for a moment as 
educators, because that is what we all are if we are measuring up to 
the opportunities and responsibilities which God has given us as 
individuals and as groups in a community wherever it is our privilege 
to work. 

I am tremendously interested in what I have heard expressed here 
today, showing the interest of this great Church and this body represent- 
ing the Church, in the international point of view. I think all of us 
recognize as never before that we no longer live in a neighborhood as 
big as our immediate community, as big as our school district, or 
county, or state, or nation. But, as one speaker has so aptly put it, 
we are in a world neighborhood, and so in these modern days our 
obligations to each other in the human family are as big as the world. 
The way we measure up, if you please, and meet those obligations and 
responsibilities, I think, depends probably upon about how large our 
point of view is, about how large our vision is. I think that is true of 
the American school teacher behind the desk and perhaps the parent 
in the home and the people of the world, no matter where they may 
be working. We meet our responsibilities, I say, about in proportion 
as we have vision. 

Great gatherings like this, bringing together peoples from many 
nations, giving people here such a splendid opportunity to get the great 
messages that will come out of this convention, (and I trust the press 
is giving it to the world) are going to help in pushing out our horizon. 

It was my privilege to meet in the initial meeting of the World 
Federation of Educational Associations, which as you know was held 



164 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



in San Francisco, six years ago ; and then again, four years ago, I 
attended the first biennial in Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1925 ; in 1927 
I was at Toronto, Canada ; and last year at Geneva, Switzerland. When 
I mingled and met and talked with those people, representing more than 
fifteen nations of the earth, educators gathered together in order that 
we might think through our educational problems together — because 
we believe the hope of the world is in the intelligent education and 
direction of the youth of the world — I tell you, friends, when I met 
and heard those people of other lands, I realized what a common 
problem it is, this working for the progress of the human family in all 
parts of the world. It is not a national job. And may I remind you 
that the reputation of the people of Utah, the schools of Utah, the 
educational forces of Utah and the West, is not only nation-wide, but 
it is world-wide, and we are looking to you. I think this nation is 
looking to the people of the West for more than you sometimes realize. 
We have never been disappointed either. 

I do not see how people could be small-minded, small in action, 
that are trained as I know your schools out here do train those who 
live in this great open country. The hymn that you sang here today 
expresses it beautifully. I do not see how people could help but have 
a big vision of their responsibility and their opportunity to serve. I 
oftentimes said to my own teachers in the building where I had the 
privilege of serving as an elementary principal, that if I were a parent of 
children I would be very grateful to that type of teacher who would 
very early in life put it into the thinking and action, if you please, of 
the children all along the line, whether it is kindergarten, elementary, 
high school or university, that type of thinking that Carruth, the 
Kansas poet, must have meant in his poem, "Each In His Own Tongue." 
I thought of it as I rode along over your beautiful country this morning. 
Those lines describe my country, and I think they describe yours. 
Carruth says: 

"A haze on the far horizon, 
The infinite, tender sky, 
The ripe, rich tint of the cornfields, 
And the wild geese sailing high, — 
And all over upland and lowland 
The charm of the goldenrod, — 
Some of us call it Autumn, 
And others call it God." 

Friends, I would be more grateful for that type of teacher who put 
that kind of thinking and appreciation of God's world and the funda- 
mental things in life into the early thinking and training of the children 
than I would be to the one who fails to do that but perhaps who teaches 
much exactness in language, or arithmetic, or geography, or what not. 
Because after all it is the fundamental things, it is the real values that 
count, that we want. 

Perhaps you would like to know what this great educational 
association of teachers has been doing recently. Your inviting me in 
here today, Mr. President, is a sample of the co-operation which we 
as a great body of teachers find everywhere. I have had the blessed 



MISS RUTH PYRTLE 



165 



privilege this year, as your president, of going about, seeing the field 
in action, (I like to call it that) as I had this blessed privilege in Salt 
Lake today, and yesterday in Ogden. Then I have had several times 
opportunities of being down in Washington where our headquarters 
are, seeing them in action. I have been interested in some of the things 
that perhaps are not directly class-room experiences that we are doing 
as a great association. For instance, an illustration of co-operating with 
even governmental agencies. Not so long ago, following the stock 
crash, President Hoover, through the Secretary of Commerce, Mr. 
LaMott, invited the great National Educational Association to give 
any assistance they could in this program that they are working upon 
to keep confidence, if you please, to keep people employed, to avoid any 
great crises. To that end more than five thousand letters were sent 
out from our headquarters, at Sixteenth and M., four blocks from the 
White House, to the leading school men all over this country in every 
state, indicating that we should not retrench in education unless ab- 
solutely necessary, but keep up our building program, keep up this 
great educational program which this Church and all Utah believes 
in so strongly. And when the answers to these five thousand letters 
came back it was a great satisfaction to me to see them tabulated and 
sent over to the Secretary of Commerce and to the President of the 
United States, and to read the letters of thanks that came back. 

That is one illustration of co-operation, which might seem to you 
almost outside of school room activities. 

Another illustration is the opportunity which we had as a great 
profession to co-operate with the department of law enforcement. No 
doubt, friends, you have heard here — maybe not so much as we hear 
further -east — much of the comment criticising "flaming youth," even 
accusing the high school youth of America of drinking more these days 
than in the days of the open saloon. So the law enforcement department 
of the government asked us to be a fact-finding body and to give the 
truth or the falsity of such statements. A questionnaire was sent out 
to more than five hundred educators in every part of this Union. 
These answers are coming back and I assure you it is very interesting 
to our great research department to tabulate these results from that 
questionnaire and to get at the facts. I am not sure it is all finished 
yet, but enough has come in to show us that there really is no truth in 
the statement that the children of America, the high school children, 
are drinking more than they did in the days of the open saloon. It is 
not true according to the facts. There is enough truth though in 
some of the answers to the questionnaires to show us that the good 
work of this Church and of the people who represent it, and all of the 
other forces at work for the good of humanity in America and in the 
world, needs to keep on and on, and constantly on. 

I could go on giving you other illustrations of co-operation. I see 
illustrated it seems to me in Utah, in this congregation today — I have 
always thought it was illustrated in Utah — one of the major problems of 
this year. We are working on the wise use of leisure time as a most 
important factor in this modern age. It is nothing new, but it is new 



166 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



this year, that we have appointed a national commission of fifty people 
and a state commission of an equal number in each state working on 
the wise use of leisure time, co-operating with all the other agencies that 
are working on that, or wanting to be a clearing house, if we may be, 
to that end. What for? For the youth of America, because we know 
how -very necessary that is. I can see many people here who remember 
that in late years we have had at least two of those great national 
programs of the N. E. A. in this beautiful city of Salt Lake. 1 
remember very well being in this very tabernacle and enjoying the pro- 
gram that we had here in 1913, and you will remember that we were 
here in 1919. This year, in 1930, we are meeting in Columbus, Ohio, 
and the theme for the meeting is "Vital V alues in Education." The 
very addresses which I have heard since I have been on this platform, 
it seems to me, would answer some of the things that we are discussing 
in our summer program — "Vital Values in Education." The first day 
will be "The International Point of View, as a Vital Value in Educa- 
tion." I have heard that discussed here today You are doing it in 
every program. "The Art of Living, as a Vital Value in Education" — 
I know no people who know that stronger than the Mormon people. 

"The Wise Use of Leisure, as a Vital Value in Education" ; "The 
Enrichment of Life, as a Vital Value in Education." Another day a 
sub-topic will be, "Creative Learning, as a Vital Value in Education." 

I just mention the topics because it seems to me so in line with 
probably the very purpose — indirectly, maybe some of you will think — 
of this great world-gathering you have here. May I remind you that 
we are working for the youth of the nation ; we are working for better 
salaries, for better teachers. We are trying to bring to the spotlight 
worthy school activities and broadcast programs and worthy •achieve- 
ments. This association is a clearing-house — I mean the National 
Educational Association — for local and state associations. It is the 
voice, if you please, of people in service. We aim to shape the ideals 
of the profession. It is the pure plan of educational progress. I feel 
that the aims of our great National Educational Association are the 
ultimate aims which you have, Mr. President, in this great world- 
gathering of people. We are working together for the human race. 
I bid you God-speed. I invite you to give us all the help that you will 
give us as a group of educators trying to lead your children aright. 
Let us in that way assist any time that we may. 

I esteem this a great honor and a great privilege for our Associa- 
tion to be allowed a few moments on this platform and to bring to you 
again the greetings of our great National Educational Association, the 
largest body of teachers not only of the United States, but of the world, 
working for the same purposes that you are, the progress, the best 
progress of humanity. I thank you. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

For the benefit of our visitor I will announce that we have in what 
is known as our Primary Association, comprised of little children, over 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



167 



one hundred thousand members; that we have in our Young Ladies' 
Mutual Improvement Association and our Young Men's Mutual Im- 
provement Association over one hundred thousand members; that in 
our Sunday Schools we have over a quarter of a million. 

I am sure it will be of interest to you to learn that we expended 
last year from the tithes of our people: 

For the construction of Ward and Stake meetinghouses $1,257,000, 
and that the people themselves spent another million. 

For the maintenance and expense of our meeting houses $588,000. 

For Stake maintenance $235,000 

The choir sang the anthem, "God is our refuge and strength." 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

The Young Men's Mutual Improvement Associations are presided 
over by three of the Apostles, so we shall not call upon them to speak 
at this time, as they have already spoken. 

Two of the members of the Superintendency of Sunday Schools 
are members of the quorum of Twelve Apostles, and Brother George 
D. Pyper, to whom we owe more I believe than to anyone else for this 
marvelous pageant that is being presented, is one of the General Superin- 
tendency of Sunday Schools, and we will allow him to talk to us for 
ten minutes. 

I wish to say that I have been associated with Brother Pyper for 
many years, and that he is one of the loyal, true, faithful Latter-day 
Saints, true to the very core. 

ELDER GEORGE D. PYPER 

My brethren and sisters : I regret very much that I was absent from 
the meeting this morning when President Grant called me. Not that I 
desired to speak, by any means, but because I always like to be found in 
my place when called for. 

I was just informed by a friend as I came on the platform that 
he had never heard a more splendid introduction to anyone who was 
absent than that given me by President Grant this morning. Probably 
it was well that I was absent as I have never in my life been called to 
face a wonderful general conference, and the shock might have proved 
fatal. 

However, I am glad to stand before you, my brethren and sisters, 
and say that I myself am not entitled to all the credit for the produc- 
tion of "The Message of the Ages." There have been some wonderful 
helpers. We have had the cooperation of the Presidency of the Church 
and the leading authorities, of Elder George Albert Smith and the 



168 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Centennial committee ; a wonderful cooperation all along the line. The 
names of the Pageant committee are as follows: W. O. Robinson and 
Junius F. Wells of the Young Men's Mutual Improvement Association 
general board; Elbert H. Eastmond, director of art of the Brigham 
Young University, Provo ; Charlotte Stewart, Salt Lake City's recrea- 
tional superintendent ; Irma Felt Bitner of the Granite stake committee ; 
Ann Nebeker of the general Primary Association board; Anthony C. 
Lund, director of the Salt Lake Tabernacle choir ; Tracy Y. Cannon, 
Tabernacle organist; Lester Hinchcliff, director of the Ogden Taber- 
nacle choir ; Leroy Robertson, a young musician of the Brigham Young 
University, Provo, who composed the motif and some of the incidental 
music and orchestrations connected with the pageant, who unfortunately 
is ill and in California, and has not been able to hear his own work; 
Bertha A. Kleinman, secretary of the Arizona Temple ; Frank W. Asper, 
Tabernacle organist; and A. Hamer Reiser, of the Deseret Sunday 
School Union Board, who has acted as secretary. 

I may say for your information that the majority of the committee 
have been working on the pageant for over six months in organizing the 
plot, selecting the scriptural texts from the Bible, Book of Mormon, the 
Doctrine and Covenants and the Pearl of Great Price. About the first 
of January, the Centennial committee sent for Sister Bertha A. Klein- 
man of Mesa, Arizona, who spent one month with the committee ; and 
together we worked out the pageant as you now have it. We believe 
and hope that it may be a foundation for a Latter-day Saint mission 
play, that might be produced on the Tabernacle block at stated periods. 

Thanks are due to those who have assisted in many other ways — 
Joseph D. C. and Cannon Young, the architects of the Church, who 
drew the plans for building this wonderful platform, as far as I know 
the greatest stage now in existence, except those that have been specially 
built for great spectacles. It is interesting to note that all of this 
has been done with love and reverence for this great building. Howard 
McKean, a splendid man, built the platform. I said to him, "Howard, be 
careful not to mar these pulpits." He said, "You do not need to warn 
me, Brother Pyper. I have such a reverence for this house that not a 
nail shall be driven where it can be avoided." 

And so all the work has been done in that spirit. Brother M. A. 
Strand put in for us a wonderful electric system. It is rather thrilling 
to me to know that part of the switchboard used is the old switchboard 
of the Salt Lake Theatre which I installed there nearly thirty years ago. 
We met with many problems in the work, but with our united efforts, 
they were overcome. It was one of these that I was helping to solve 
this morning when called for by the President. 

I do not know how many missionaries are abroad in the world to- 
day, but it may be interesting to you to learn that we have approximate- 
ly fifteen hundred men and women working in this pageant, and every 
one of them is a missionary. If you could get among them and hear their 
expressions and partake of their enthusiasm you would be surprised — 
at least you would be happy as I have been. Anything they can do to 



ELDER GEORGE D. PYPER 



169 



further the cause of truth they are happy in doing. Their only interest 
is the glory of God and the furtherance of his work upon the earth. 

I walked home with a man yesterday who said : " 'The Message of 
the Ages' has strengthened my faith." And I believe it is the feeling of 
all the members of our committee that if the production does that, if it 
strengthens the faith of the people in any way their greatest hopes and 
wishes will be realized. 

There are many more connected with the production that I should 
like 'to name, but time will not permit. 

I want to bear my testimo.>;', my brethren and sisters, to the work 
of the Lord. I know that God lives, because I have felt his presence 
and he has been my refuge and comfort, as has been sung today, in time 
of trouble and tribulation. I know that Jesus is the Christ because I 
have felt the warmth of his love. I know that this Gospel of the latter 
days is true because of the blessings it has brought to me and mine in 
this life and the assurances it has given me concerning the life to come. 
My greatest desire now is that the few years I may have left upon 
this earth I may devote to his glory and the furtherance of his cause. 
For this I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER WILLARD YOUNG 

My beloved brethren and sisters : I presume it is owing to the 
fact that I am the son of President Brigham Young that I have this 
honor. 

I want to say that I believe if father were here he would rejoice 
very greatly in the proceedings that have taken place during the last 
few days. 

The foundation of our faith is that we believe that Jesus Christ is 
the Son of God. We have heard quoted some of the Savior's sayings, 
such as: "If you come unto me you shall have eternal life," and "If 
you come unto me and are baptized ye shall be saved." What is salva- 
tion, and what is eternal life ? 

To be saved is this, that if we comply with the requirements set 
forth by our Savior, we will not have to suffer for our sins. That is 
one thing. Another thing is that if we accept the Gospel, become mem- 
bers of the Church of Jesus Christ and remain faithful to the end. 
when we die our spirits will go into paradise ; that is, we will be placed 
beyond the power of evil. We will not have to suffer the temptations 
that we suffer here. 

We are promised if we become members of this Church and are 
faithful to the end that when the Savior comes again, we shall receive 
a resurrection, and that promise is not given to any others than those 
who accept the terms. 

Members of the Church who are faithful to the end will have life 
in the presence of God. If one has complied with the requirements of 
salvation in the terrestrial kingdom, he will have eternal life. If he 
complies with the requirements of salvation in the telestial kingdom 
he will have eternal life. If he complies with the requirements for 



170 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



exaltation in the celestial kingdom he will have eternal life and exalta- 
tion in that kingdom. 

May God help us to properly use the knowledge that has been re- 
vealed to us, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

We will now hear from Elder Junius F. Wells, one of the As- 
sistant Historians of the Church, a son of Brigham Young's counselor, 
Daniel H. Wells, who succeeded my father in that position. 

ELDER JUNIUS F. WELLS 

Assistant Church Historian 

Necessarily what I shall say must be prefatory to that which I should 
like to have recorded as my contribution to the great volume of testimony 
that is going forth from this centennial conference of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to all the world. 

I feel as President Brigham H. Roberts did concerning the an- 
nouncement of his prodigious work, which is perhaps one of the most 
important, and perhaps longest-lived contributions to this centennial 
year of any that shall go forth, the History of the Church, a work, 
I trust, that shall find its place in every public library, in every school 
library, and in the homes of the affluent who can afford to buy it. 
I will go farther and say I, hope it shall find a place in the homes of 
the stockmen, who should give their sons a calf to raise with which 
to pay for those books; in the homes of the agriculturists who should 
let their sons cultivate a sufficient acreage of sugar beets to pay for them. 
They will in the course of time be worth many acres of sugar beets. 

I wish to say a word concerning Andrew Jenson. I was so happy 
and pleased this morning that he should have the opportunity of address- 
ing this great conference, for I knew that the desire lay near to his 
heart. Andrew Jenson, circumnavigator of the world in both directions, 
for years has devoted himself to historical study and research among 
the Latter-day Saints and has assembled a library of upwards of two 
thousand bound volumes, more than three thousand titled pamphlets and 
more than sixteen thousand manuscript biographies. These he has 
generously given to the Church and we have found lodgment for them 
in what we are designating the Jenson Alcove in the library of the 
Historian's Office. 

Now if I have not exhausted my ten minutes, I should like to bear 
my testimony. I have borne my testimony from this stand more times 
than one concerning the Church to which I owe my existence through 
the faithful acceptance of its doctrines by my father and my mother. 
I have borne my testimony concerning the personnel of its general 
officers : the successors to Joseph Smith in the Presidency, six of whom 
I have personally and somewhat familiarly known and served, and the 
forty-one out of fifty-four Apostles whom I have personally known and 
loved, admired and upheld by my faith and prayers. I will not attempt 



ELDER JUNIUS F. WELLS 



171 



to name the number of Seventies, but I have known a good many of 
them. I desire to bear my testimony that these men were men of God. 

I should like to say a word concerning my testimony of Joseph 
Smith the Prophet, for I wish to challenge the world upon this propo- 
sition, that the world of unbelievers together with the believers among 
the Latter-day Saints, are witnesses before mankind to the fact that 
Joseph Smith was a prophet of God. I will prove it to you. On the 
night of the 22nd of September, 1823, Joseph Smith appealed to God 
for a further revelation concerning his standing before the Almighty, 
and almost instantly in response to his prayer his room was lighted 
up by a light exceeding that of the noonday sun and within it appeared 
a personage. This personage spoke to him. I will quote Joseph's 
own words : 

"He called me by name, and said unto me that he was a messenger sent 
from the presence of God to me, and that his name was Moroni; that God had 
a work for me to do; and that my name should be had for good and evil among 
all nations, kindreds and tongues, or that it should be both good and evil spoken 
of among all people." 

Now we say to the world, you have fulfilled your part and are 
fulfilling your part, and will be held responsible for it before the heavens, 
in traducing the name of Joseph Smith, in proclaiming him as an im- 
poster, in speaking evil of him. We Latter-day Saints, in this volume 
of testimony that is broadcast from this conference, and in the action 
that we have taken since Joseph Smith came to his ministry, to uphold 
his testimony and maintain it before the world, are speaking his name 
for good, have been doing so in the past, and shall continue to do so 
in the future. And so between us we declare to mankind that Joseph 
Smith was a prophet of God, and I challenge the world to refute that 
statement. 

The Lord bless you all. Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I regret beyond expression that we have no more time left. We 
have not as yet heard from Bishop John Wells. We shall have to ask 
Brother Wells to speak very briefly instead of occupying the usual 
fifteen or twenty minutes that have been allotted to the General 
Authorities of the Church. 

ELDER JOHN WELLS 

Of the Presiding Bishopric 

I have been deeply impressed with the references that have been 
made to the great pageant, particularly with the comments of our 
previous speaker, Junius F. Wells. It will serve to remind the Latter- 
day Saints of the program of our Father in heaven for the development 
and salvation of his children. The pageant gives a history of the world 



172 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



that is hardly ever given in textbooks. It shows the dealings of our 
Father with his children through various generations. 

No one could listen to the music and to the recitation, and see 
the marvelous presentation of the great events, without strongly feeling 
the power and influence of God's messengers, prophets, and repre- 
sentatives who have held the holy priesthood. 

We speak of the great events that have transpired in this Church, 
the restoration of the Gospel through the medium of the Prophet Joseph 
Smith. I never tire of hearing it. It is always music to me. It is the 
greatest subject of this last dispensation. We should constantly teach 
to our children and to others the story of the Prophet's first vision, the 
coming of the Angel Moroni, the delivery of the plates, the translation 
of the book, the testimony of the Three Witnesses, and the organization 
of the Church. We should also teach the mission of John the Baptist, 
and the travels, labors, and miracles of our Lord and Savior Jesus 
Christ. 

I am going to read to you a small slip that came to my attention 
years ago, written by a man named Francis, and which appeared in a 
California newspaper. It ranks very high, I believe, in current liter- 
ature, and when I read it, it fills my mind with a very profound 
impression. 

"Here is a man who was born in an obscure village, child of a peasant 
woman. He grew up in another obscure village. He worked in a carpenter 
shop until he was thirty, and then for three years he was an itinerant preacher. 
He never wrote a book. He never held an oflice. He never owned a home. He 
never had a family. He never went to college. He never put his foot inside 
a big city. He never traveled two hundred miles from the place where he was 
born. He never did one of the things that usually accompany greatness. He 
had no credentials but himself. He had nothing to do with this world except 
the naked power of his divine manhood. 

"While still a young man, the tide of popular opinion turned against him. 
His friends ran away. One of them denied him. Another betrayed him. He 
was turned over to his enemies. He went through the mockery of a trial. He 
was nailed upon the cross between two thieves. His executioners gambled for 
the only piece of property he had on earth while he was dying, and that was his 
coat. When he was dead, he was taken down and laid in a borrowed grave 
through the pity of a friend. 

"Nineteen wide centuries have come and gone and today he is the center 
of the human race and the leader of the column of progress. I am far within 
the mark when I say that all the armies that ever marched, and all the navies 
that were ever built, and all the parliaments that ever sat and all the kings that 
ever reigned, put together, have not affected the life of man upon this earth as 
powerfully as has this one solitary life." 

We believe in God the Eternal Father. We believe in his Son 
Jesus Christ, our Elder Brother and Redeemer, our Advocate with the 
Father, who came to redeem mankind from the fall of Adam and to 
lay down a code of laws known to us as the Gospel of Jesus Christ, by 
obedience to which we may return to our Father in heaven. After 
three years of missionary labor, he was crucified, and having overcome 
all things, all power was given unto him, both in heaven and in earth. 
By his sacrifice he brought to pass the resurrection and eternal life. 



ELDER JOHN WELLS 



173 



The Gospel he taught has been restored in these latter days through 
the instrumentality of the Prophet Joseph Smith, who received his 
authority from John the Baptist, and from Peter, James and John. 

I hope that some future historian of the Church (say fifty years 
from now) will record that as a result of this great centennial gathering 
there developed among the Latter-day Saints a deeper spirituality, a 
more sincere desire to serve the Lord our God, a truer and more 
friendly neighborliness and love of fellowmen than ever before. 

May the blessings of the Lord be with this people, and may his 
special blessings rest upon those who direct the affairs of this Church, 
I sincerely pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

We would all be disappointed if we did not have a few words of 
blessing from the great grandson of the martyred Patriarch, who now 
stands as our Presiding Patriarch. 

Brother Hyrnm G. Smith has been in very poor health for some 
time, and at one time I felt it would hardly be fair to ask him to say 
anything at this conference. But he seemed to have sufficient vigor to 
offer a good prayer at the opening of this conference, and we shall be 
pleased now to have a few words of blessing and testimony from him. 

ELDER HYRUM G. SMITH 

Presiding Patriarch of the Church 

I am very grateful, my brethren and sisters, for this important 
privilege, although I had thought there would not be time for me to 
appear the second time. 

GRATEFUL FOR RETURN OF HEALTH 

I am very grateful indeed for the prayers of the saints, and I 
testify that the Lord has heard them in my behalf. 

Two of the late General Conferences of the Church I have heard 
over the radio from my home. I have been very grateful to be able 
to attend all of the sessions of this conference and am very grateful 
for the strength that has returned to me and that I am able to enjoy 
your association and presence. 

A great many testimonies of my work, the work of the Lord, have 
come to me during this conference, and I am praying that what few 
words I can say will be acceptable in the time that is allotted, or left. 

PARENTAGE EXPLAINED 

Many people have asked me about my parentage and who I am, 
and in just a few words let me answer your questions thusly: I happen 
to be the oldest son of my father, who was Hyrum Fisher Smith, the 
oldest son of his father, the late Patriarch John Smith, who was the 
oldest son of his father, the Patriarch Hyrum Smith. My grandfather 
was the oldest brother of his father's children, but his younger brother

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



became the President of the Church and perhaps because of that reason 
was better known by the people. Nevertheless, grandfather became the 
Presiding Patriarch of the Church at the age of twenty-three years, 
and I think he holds the record today for time of service, having served 
in that office for fifty-six years. Perhaps that is sufficient in that 
respect. 

WITNESSES OF THE LORD'S GOODNESS 

I want to bear testimony however to the fact that the Lord has 
blessed me in the work that has been entrusted to my hands as one 
of the young men of the Church. My grandfather in his fifty-six years 
was instrumental in administering about 21,000 recorded blessings, to 
say nothing of the hundreds of others that were unrecorded. And 
about 20,000 of his blessings are in the archives of the Church today. 
Eighteen years ago last Sunday I was sustained by the vote of the 
General Conference in this building to hold the office that I now bear. 
During that time there have been accumulated in my office nearly twenty 
thousand testimonies or witnesses that the Lord has been very kind 
to me. I am very grateful for the faith that the Lord has inspired in 
the minds of the saints and members of the Church in their blessings 
and in the power of the Lord through the holy priesthood. 

I have been asked many times by individuals who have received the 
priesthood how I know that I have the priesthood. They too have 
been ordained to offices in the priesthood, but they have sometimes won- 
dered whether or not they really hold the priesthood, because of their 
inactivity in the Church. I want to testify to you, my brethren and 
sisters, that I know that I possess the priesthood of God, because I 
have faith in those witnesses, nearly twenty thousand of them, and many 
others not recorded. They are a recorded witness that may go on 
down through the ages in the archives of the Church as well as in the 
hearts and homes and lives of the saints. 

BLESSINGS FOR ALL 

I am very grateful to be an instrument in the hands of the Lord 
in officiating in this sacred work, and indeed it is a sacred work. I 
pray God's blessings upon the membership of the Church and the c Sicers 
of the Church — President Grant and his counselors, the quorum of the 
Twelve Apostles, the Seventies and other presiding officers; the 
Elders, Priests, Teachers and Deacons throughout the Church. I pray 
God to bless them and all their officers and their work in righteousness. 
I pray for the great body of High Priests throughout the Church. It 
was a thrilling sight when I saw them arise in this conference. God 
bless the High Priests in the Church, that they too may know that 
they possess that power, for the Lord himself was a great High Priest. 
The Lord Jesus Christ declared it, and these men bear his power in the 
earth today and are his witnesses ; and I share that with them, in which 
I glorify the Lord. 

I praise the Lord for his blessings, and as his servant I bless the 
entire membership of the Church. May God bless his servants the 



ELDER HYRUM G. SMITH 



175 



missionaries, both men and women, wherever they are called to labor, 
at home or abroad, and I bless them as his servant, that they may con- 
tinue to go and come in safety, whether upon water or upon land, wheth- 
er among their friends or their enemies, that they may go in the power 
of God as his witnesses ; that they may find friends and search out the 
honest in heart, the blood of Israel, and those whom God would have 
know the truth. 

I bless all who are working in righteousness throughout the world, 
the honest in heart, the sick, the suffering, the destitute. I pray God 
to provide their needs and to give them faith to hear and to heed the 
teachings of his servants. My heart is filled with humility and with 
blessings for all who deserve them. I know that God is merciful, that 
he loves the honest in heart, and that his blessings go out to the sick ; 
for when he was upon the earth in person he visited them and blessed 
them and healed them. I pray his blessings upon them today, that they 
may continue to receive comfort and the power to be healed and; 
restored. I bless them to this end in the Church and in the land 
throughout our mountain country here, those who are suffering in 
humility and have faith to be healed. God bless them. 

TESTIMONY OF GOD'S WORK 

I know that this is the work of God, that he is merciful to his 
children, and that this work will go on and on and on until it has 
finished its full purpose in the earth. This is the work that Daniel 
saw that should never be thrown down or given to another people, 
but should go on and on until it should fill the earth. And may God 
bless us to be instrumental in his hands in bringing about these holy 
purposes. May his Holy Spirit attend us and bless us in our homes. 
May his blessing be upon our lands, in our offices, in our fields, and 
with our flocks and herds. May our lands produce and grow fruit 
that will be meet for food, and then may we honor God in our tithes 
and in our offerings. Be honest with him and he will remember you 
and his blessings will be poured out upon you in rich abundance, and 
you will come up before him in an acceptable manner and go on richly 
endowed by his power and blessing, to be magnified in the world as 
humble servants carrying out his purposes. Unto this end I pray God's 
blessing upon the Church in all of its activities whether at home or 
abroad, both in the auxiliary organizations and in the quorums and 
offices of the priesthood — all of which I pray for in the name of the 
Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

APPRECIATION OF DEVOTION OF TEMPLE WORKERS 

I desire to express my appreciation to the many hundreds who 
are working in our temples without remuneration — several hundred in 
the Salt Lake Temple alone. In all of our temples an immense and 
wonderful work is being accomplished, all on missionary time, and I 
appreciate it. On behalf of the Presidency of the Church I extend our 
blessing to all of these devoted workers. 

President Grant asked all who were in the audience who had had 
the privilege of shaking hands with President Brigham Young to arise 
and raise their right hands. 

There was a large number present who had had this privilege. 

The President then asked those who were present at the con- 
ference of the Church fifty years ago to arise and raise their right hands. 

There was a considerable number in the audience who had attended 
that conference, and who so indicated in the manner requested by 
President Grant. 

The choir and congregation joined in singing "God be with you till 
we meet again."

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I desire, on behalf of the Presidency and the General Authorities 
of the Church, to thank the City Commissioners, the Police Department, 
the Commercial Club, the leading business men of our city, and all who 
have taken part so energetically and willingly to make a success, so 
far as was in their power, of this great conference. I wish particularly 
to thank each and every one who has given his or her services to make 
a success of the production of the wonderful pageant which is being 
presented nightly in this building. We think it is a marvel of inspira- 
tion, and we feel to pour out our blessings upon all who have been 
connected with it. 

TO SPEAK AT SERVICES NEXT SUNDAY 

The time has expired. I had hoped to have time to say something 
to the people. Those of you who happen to be in the city next Sunday, 
if you will come to the afternoon services in this building, may hear me 
speak to you on that occasion. 

THANKS SINGERS AND OTHERS 

I wish to thank all of the splendid singers — our own tabernacle 
choir, the tabernacle choir from Provo, the tabernacle choir from 
Ogden, the young people from the Latter-day Saints College, who sang 
for us yesterday ; the leaders of these organizations, those who have sung 
solos, and all who have assisted in providing us with the beautiful music 
that we have heard. I wish to thank everybody who has contributed 
to the success of this conference, and if anyone has been overlooked, 
please consider yourself thanked. 

President Anthony W. Ivins offered the benediction. 
Conference adjourned for six months. 



Accompaniments and interludes were played on the great organ by

SUNDAY, APRIL 13, 1930, 2:00 P. M., SALT LAKE 
TABERNACLE 

In his closing remarks at the General Conference, President Heber 
J. Grant announced that there was not sufficient time left for him to 
speak as he had hoped to do, and that he would therefore deliver an 
address at the services to be held in the Salt Lake Tabernacle, Sunday, 
April 13th, at 2:00 p. m. 

The following is a verbatum report of the remarks of the speakers 
at that meeting: 

ELDER ALONZO A. HINCKLEY 

It is my sincere desire that I shall make a sacred use of the precious 
time granted to me on this occasion, and that with an eye single to the 
glory of God I shall bear a faithful testimony to the divinity of this work. 

My soul has been made to rejoice exceedingly during the sessions 
of the recent conference. I have been filled with gratitude and thanks- 
giving, filled with testimony and good desires ; blessed with a determin- 
ation to offer continued service unto the Lord, praying for a spirit that 
shall permit me to discern between the essentials and non-essentials and 
center upon the essentials and offer full service. 

I never experienced such a day in my life as the day on which 
we Opened our centennial conference. I never felt a spirit more thrilling 
than on that occasion. As I stood with that great body of high priests 
to bear witness before God that we sustain the General Authorities of 
the Church in their position as divinely called and appointed leaders, my 
soul went out in gratitude. As we rent the heavens with the glad shout 
of hosanna to God and the Lamb, it seemed heavenly. Then in finish- 
ing the first session, the President of the Church blessed us not only 
from the kindness of his heart and the good desires and love that he 
has for all men (especially for the righteous) and for all who bear rule 
in the nation, as well as the Latter-day Saints. I thought, this is not just 
the voice of a kindly man, good and great and noble in his intentions, 
but this is one speaking by divine authority, and whomsoever he blesses 
God will bless, for he acts for God in the name of Jesus Christ. 

Another week has elapsed, and on this another Sabbath we find 
ourselves here in worship before the Lord. The message of the cen- 
tennial has gone forth and will continue its mission in the world. Mor- 
monism, so-called, will be better known now than ever before. We 
stand in a remarkable position in the world, claiming no descent from or 
allegiance with any sect or denomination in the world, and every sect 
and denomination in the world is happy that they are not responsible 
for our existence. We stand and bear testimony of ourselves that this 
is verily the Church and Kingdom of God, and that it is founded upon 
the everlasting and enduring principles of God and is unshakable. We 



ELDER ALONZO A. HINCKLEY 179 



occupy a position different even from our brethren in that remarkable 
period, the meridian of time, when the Savior organized his Church and 
ministered among men. At that period of time it was given unto the 
authorities to know that while they proclaimed the Gospel with all fervor 
and with a full knowledge, and sought to bring all men to an understand- 
ing of the truth, that while they waged a righteous cause, yet they knew 
that the Dispensation of the Fulness of Times was yet far ahead. I have 
been led to believe that this knowledge must have carried with it some 
sorrow, when they knew there would come a time of dwindling in un- 
belief, that there would come a time when the true faith should be lost, a 
time when men should seek for the truth and should not find it. It must 
have been to them somewhat sorrowful. 

But the Lord did not leave them without the knowledge that this 
Gospel, which is eternal and everlasting, should finally prevail, in the day 
of the restitution of all things. I have been much impressed with the tes- 
timony of Peter, when he talked to those unbelieving Jews. Peter and 
John, following the Pentecostal outpouring of the Holy Ghost, proceed- 
ing in their ministry, had gone to the temple. They saw a lame man who 
stood before the Gate Beautiful and pleaded for alms. Peter, speaking 
to him said : "Look on us," and he looked steadfastly into their faces, 
perhaps expecting alms. Peter said : "Silver and gold have I none, but 
such as I have give I thee. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth 
rise up and walk." And he took him by the hand, and he did arise and 
did walk; and, rejoicing, entered into the temple with the brethren. 

It created consternation, and men gathered to know what had hap- 
pened. Peter reasoned with them and said : "Why art thou so concern- 
ed? Why, is this so wonderful? Why do you look upon us as though it 
is any power inherent with us ? This Jesus whom you would not release, 
whom Pilate would have released, but you clamored and demanded that 
he should release you a murderer, and you pleaded for his crucifixion- — 
this Jesus has God raised from the dead, and it is through his power 
that this man stands forth healed." Then Peter said, referring to the 
betrayal and crucifixion. "I wot that through ignorance ye did it." And 
he warned them and commanded them to repent. "Repent, ye, there- 
fore!" and he, said unto them, not as he had said on the day of Pente- 
cost, "Repent and be baptized and have the Holy Ghost bestowed upon 
you," but "Repent ye therefore, .... that your sins may be blotted out, 
when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord ; 
and he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you." 

Then, through the remission of sins, there was a time coming, I say, 
it was revealed unto Peter, a great and glorious time when Jesus Christ 
would come again. For he did say that the heavens must retain him until 
the restitution of all things spoken by God through all the prophets since 
the world began. In that time of restitution, when God would send 
again Jesus Christ, whom the heavens must retain until then, should come 
into fulfilment of things spoken by all the holy prophets since the world 
began. 

Is it not wonderful, my brethren and sisters, that there should be 



180 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



a people now living who declare that this is the dispensation, or period 
wherein Paul declared God should gather together in one all things in 
Christ Jesus, both in heaven and on earth ? The message of the Latter- 
day Saints is to the world, and this great centennial conference has sent 
anew the declaration abroad, that this Dispensation of the Fulness of 
Times has been ushered in; that God has sent again from the heavens 
Jesus Christ; that he has sent ministering angels, each with his special 
power and special commission and special authority. He has taken away 
from the world and removed every superstition, every tradition, every 
false interpretation, and has established anew the Gospel of Jesus Christ 
and coupled it, not with any promise of some future time when we shall 
dwindle in unbelief and be left in darkness, but established his Church, 
given his own testimony that it shall never be thrown down or given to 
another people, but that it shall go on and on and on until.it shall fill 
the whole earth. 

This is a period of preparation, this is a period of proclamation. This 
is a time of warning. The responsibility is given to the Latter-day 
Saints that as they are warned they shall warn their neighbors, until there 
shall be no ear that shall not hear, nor eye that shall not see, nor heart that 
shall not be penetrated. The Gospel is the voice of God to all the world, 
calling them to repentance, to a godly life; with an assurance that un- 
to all who conform their lives to the requirements of the Gospel there 
shall be no gift and no blessing that shall be withheld from them. 

The Lord himself has said that it is the voice of God ; he has called 
and he says: 

"Hear, O ye heavens, and give ear, O earth, and rejoice ye inhabi- 
tants thereof, for the Lord is God, and beside him there is no Savior." 

This is our testimony. This is the testimony of hundreds of thous- 
ands of Latter-day Saints who have been brought to a knowledge of the 
truth, and they who have conformed their lives to all Gospel require- 
ments know that their feet are placed in certain and in sacred paths, and 
that if they remain faithful they shall be led to salvation and exalta- 
tion in the presence of God. . 

This is my testimony. I rejoice in the leadership of this Church. I 
bear testimony of the divinity of the lives, mission and labors of the 
Prophet Joseph Smith and those who have followed him. I rejoice like- 
wise in the goodness that God has manifested in the consideration of his 
children, that no man has to walk alone, or lean upon the testimony of 
some one else, but that the Lord gives a testimony to each and every in- 
dividual who accepts the truth and conforms his life to the requirements 
of the Gospel. 

I bear my testimony as one of the third generation in this Church, 
that as my grandfathers and grandmothers, as my father and my mother 
knew, so know I that this is the Church and Kingdom of God and his 
power unto salvation now and forever. May the Lord help us to be true 
to the end, is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



181 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I had hoped that during our conference we would have an abun- 
dance of time — seeing that we had four days instead of the usual three 
— in which I might make some closing remarks at the last session. It 
does seem that we never get quite enough time at our conferences. I know 
of nothing that has been more interesting to me in these gatherings than 
the brief addresses we have had upon many occasions from presidents 
of stakes. Since we quit having overflow meetings in the Assembly Hall 
we have not been calling on returned mission presidents and presidents 
of stakes to speak at our conferences, as we have lacked the time neces- 
sary to hear from them. 

I do not know but that in the future it might be a wise thing for us 
to have our meetings start at half past nine and half past one, as an hour 
and a half is sufficient time for most people to eat their lunch, and this 
would allow two and a half hours for each session of the conference. 

Since I became President of the Church, we have always been 
crowded for time towards the close of our conferences and have had to 
limit some of our brethren of the General Authorities to very brief ad- 
dresses, which I regret. I realize that twenty minutes is hardly sufficient 
time for a man to enlarge upon any idea to a very great extent, and yet I 
believe that the five minute speeches by our sisters and the very brief 
remarks by our presidents of missions during our conference have 
found a warm echo in the hearts of those who listened. 

A WONDERFUL CHANGE 

One of the things I wished to say at the conference I will say now, 
and that is that I have never felt happier in my life than over the wonder- 
ful change that seems to have come all over the world in the attitude of 
people toward the Latter-day Saints. It has fallen to my lot now to 
labor for forty-seven and a half years as one of the General Authorities 
of the Church. In my early ministry as one of the officials, almost 
without exception as I traveled around the country, I found a spirit 
amounting almost to hatred in the hearts of people toward the Mormons. 
I have found people who would double up their fists and say : "If I had 
my way I would put all of you Mormons in the Tabernacle, and then 
turn the guns of Fort Douglas upon you." 

I remember that during my three years' ministry in Europe I did 
not succeed in getting one single line of refutation in any of the 
newspapers of Great Britain, notwithstanding some of the vilest and most 
wicked and abominable stories were printed against our people. 

ONE PARTICULAR CASE 

I call to mind one particular case. I went to London with a letter 
of introduction from the shipping firm with whom we had done business 
for over fifty years, to the editor of one of the large papers. This letter 
of introduction not only vouched for me as a gentleman of integrity 
and honor, whose word was as good as his bond, but it also vouched 
for all of my predecessors as presidents of the European mission being 



182 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



in that same class. The editor to whom the letter was addressed was 
away, but his assistant, a Mr. Robinson, received me. When I told him 
I was anxious to refute the seven to ten columns that had been published 
on different occasions in his paper, he declined to accept a single thing 
that I would write. He announced that he was convinced that they had 
published the exact things that ought to be published about the "Mor- 
mon" people. 

LETTERS OF INTRODUCTION 

I answered him that a man may call his neighbor a liar, but that 
does not make him a liar. Yet he might be honest in thinking that his 
neighbor had lied. I told him I defied him to furnish a certificate of 
character from any reputable man or woman for any of the men or 
women who had furnished him the information that had appeared in his 
paper. I told him that I had letters of introduction from influential 
bankers in New York, Chicago and San Francisco, and from every non- 
Mormon banker in Salt Lake City, vouching for my integrity. I had no 
testimonies, I told him, from "Mormon" bankers. That would be 
equivalent to my writing a testimony : "To whom it may concern : The 
bearer, Heber J. Grant, is an honorable man. Very respectfully, Heber 
J. Grant." 

All of my credentials were from those not of our Church. He said : 
"It does not make any difference what you have. We will not publish 
anything that you have to say. We believe that we have published the 
right things." "I know," was my reply, "that you have published that 
which is false." 

At that time all of our missionaries in Great Britain were expected 
to wear "stovepipe" hats and Prince Albert coats. They seemed to be 
very particular at that time in regard to dress. They have changed some- 
what in the last twenty or more years. 

THE ASSISTANT EDITOR 

When I got to the door I put my hat on, turned arouna, took it off 
and pretended to have an idea. I had had the idea as I was walking up- 
stairs after the boy told me that the edtior was out, but that the assistant 
editor, Mr. Robinson would receive me. I turned around and said : "By 
the way, my letter was not to you. The editor is out. You are only the 
assistant editor, and if I remember correctly the young man who ushered 
me upstairs told me your name was Robinson. Is that correct?" 

He said: "It is." 

"Do you know Phil Robinson ?" 

"Everyone knows Phil Robinson." 

I said: "Would you accept any statement that Phil Robinson 
made?" 

"Certainly I would." 

"Did he represent the London Telegraph, one of the two greatest 
(and I emphasized the two greatest, because his paper was not one of 
them) London newspapers, during the Boer war?" 

"Yes, he was their correspondent." 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



183 



"Were all of his statements received at one hundred cents on the 
dollar?" 

"Certainly." 

"Then you would believe anything he says?" 
"Certainly." 

"All right. Buy his book entitled 'Sinners and Saints,' and you 
will find that everything that you have published in your paper is a lie 
pure and simple. It will only cost you two shillings, and if that is too 
expensive, I will be very glad to purchase it and present it to you with 
my compliments." 

He said : "You astound me." 

I said : "You are not the only person that has been astounded when 
he has come up against the Mormon question." 
He said : "Write us half a column." 

I said : "Seven to ten columns of falsehoods and a half column of 
refutation. Small favors thankfully received, and larger ones in pro- 
portion. In two hours, you shall have your half column." 

MANUSCRIPT [RETURNED 

I sent it to him. He kept it the usual thirty to sixty days and re- 
turned it with the usual printed slip, many of which I have seen : "The 
editor regrets very much that he cannot find space for this article." The 
manuscript was sent back to me. 

THE CONDITION IN EUROPE TODAY 

What a wonderful change ! When Brother Talmage who is sitting 
upon this stand presided over the European mission, and today while 
Brother John A. Widtsoe is presiding over that mission, we have been 
able to get practically anything and everything that we desire printed 
in the newspapers. They give us the best kind of notices regarding our 
conferences there, favorable and honorable notices. 

OUR LOCAL MORNING NEWSPAPER 

I am grateful beyond expression for the change in attitude of our 
local morning newspaper. I wish to pay a tribute to them for publish- 
ing twelve pages with illustrations of all the presidents of the Church, 
my counselors, our great temple in this city and all our other temples, 
and for accepting an article written by one of the General Authorities 
of the Church, covering the twelve pages. 

I am reminded of the fact that some years ago I delivered a sermon 
in this tabernacle and the report of it was so garbled by that paper the 
next day that it was about as honest as though a man had said : "I killed 
John Jones in self defense," and someone had published that this man 
said : "I killed John Jones," without mentioning that it was "in self de- 
fense." 

I remember that the president of the great Hartford Fire Insurance 
company, of which I was the agent at that time (I have had the honor of 
representing them for more than fifty years) was in the audience at the 



184 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



time I preached the sermon. The next morning he read this garbled 
report, and he said to me : "You ought to sue that libelous paper ; that 
is not what you said at all. They have twisted around what you did say, 
making it altogether different." 

Today no one could ask for fairer publicity or for a better article to 
be written, with illustrations, than the twelve pages that the Tribune re- 
cently published to which I refer. I am very grateful for this wonderful 
change. 

A VICIOUS OPPONENT 

I remember that when George Q. Cannon was elected a delegate to 
Congress his right to a seat in Congress was contested. The attorney 
who went to Washington to oppose Brother Cannon, and in behalf of 
the man who had received, as I remember it, just ten per cent as many 
votes as President Cannon, told the Congressmen that we were a vile 
lot, and went on to say that if a man were opposed to the Mormon 
hierarchy he was liable to disappear and nobody would know what had 
become of him ; that a man took his life in his hands if he dared to be 
in opposition to the Mormon people. When he got through President 
Cannon said to him, calling him by name : 

"You pride yourself that than you, no more bitter, no more unre- 
lenting, vicious opponent of this awful Mormon system lives, do you 
not ?" 

"I certainly do." 

Brother Cannon said, addressing the committee hearing his case: 
"Gentlemen, I do not think it is at all necessary for me to answer the 
gentleman's arguments. He has lived with us for over twenty years. 
He has a fine dwelling that has cost about $25,000 to erect." Then he 
sat down and the committee voted for Brother Cannon to retain his seat. 

FRANCHISE TO WOMEN 

Years later it was suggested that the horrible Mormon problem 
could be solved by giving the franchise to the women. It so happened 
that the legislature was in session at the time, and there was not a 
single non-Mormon in the legislature. Within 48 hours, if my memory 
serves me right, the women were enfranchised by our legislature. The 
same identical gentleman who was employed to fight George Q. Cannon's 
taking his seat in Congress, was sent to Washington to have the franchise 
taken away from the Mormon women as he said that it only added 
power to the awful hierarchy. He announced that the Mormons had 
from two to twenty wives, etc., and that these women were all slaves and 
voted just as they were told to do by their husbands. 

When he got through speaking, President Cannon remarked : "Does 
it not surprise you, gentlemen, as you are all married, how some intelli- 
gent men believe that other men's wives can be bossed." He then sat 
down. He had killed the gentleman's argument. 

However, when the discussion came before the Congress of the 
United States, the franchise was taken away from the women of Utah, 
but it was later restored when Utah attained statehood.

PLURAL MARRIAGE 

The statement about every Mormon having from two to twenty 
wives, which has been uttered many, many times, is an absolute false- 
hood. I presided ecclesiastically for two years over one of the counties 
during the time that we were preaching and practicing plural marriage, 
and no individual was permitted to take a plural wife without the writ- 
ten recommendation of the bishop of the ward in which he resided, 
vouching for his character. Not only that, the president of the stake had 
to vouch for his character as well. And before he could go into the 
temple to marry a plural wife the President of the Church had to give 
him a recommend. I had only two applications for permission to marry 
plural wives during the entire time I presided over the Tooele stake of 
Zion, covering the entire county of Tooele, and I refused them both. I 
said to the first applicant: "What is needed in your family is sufficient 
brains to take care of one wife and one family, and certainly you cannot 
get a recommend from me to marry another wife." 

To the next man I said : "I happen to have lived in Salt Lake 
before I came out here, and although you are vouched for by your bishop 
he is not familiar with your conduct when you are in Salt Lake. I hap- 
pen to have seen you under the influence of liquor, and your kind can- 
not get a recommend from me to obtain another wife. It is bad enough 
to have a man who breaks the Word of Wisdom and gets drunk raising 
one family, without giving him the opportunity to raise another." 

There never was a time in the history of the people of Utah that 
two per cent of the population were liable under the Edmunds-Tucker 
act. But it was a very fine argument to say that we imported, as people 
are saying yet that we do, women to Utah and forced them into plural 
marriage. 

AN INCIDENT IN CHICAGO 

The first time I was in the east, in the city of Chicago, in May, 
1883, a gentleman who afterward became the general manager of one 
of the greatest insurance companies in the world, whose representative 
I was, took me to dinner at the Palmer House. After dinner there were 
about twenty ladies in the rotunda, and he said to me : "I have invited 
my lady friends here, Mr. Grant, to meet you." 

I was a young man of 26 and it was my first trip east. I never had 
read a book on etiquette — and by the way, I never have read one since 
— and so I watched to see what people did so that I might not make a 
mistake. I noticed after eating that bowls were brought to us with a 
piece of orange in them. I thought it did not look very much like 
orangeade and wondered what it was. I saw my friend dip his fingers 
in the water and wipe them, and so I did the same. 

When we came out to the rotunda, I noticed that he kept his hat on, 
notwithstanding there were ladies there. So I kept mine on. One of 
the ladies turned to me, after we had chatted a few moments, and said : 

"Now — now, really, Mr. Grant, I don't wish to give offense, but 
would you mind removing your hat ?"

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



I said : "Not at all, madame, I am only 26 years old, and the horns 
do not come out on the Mormons until they are 32. You will have to 
wait six more years." 

She blushed and said : "Oh, I have heard that Mormons have horns." 

I said : "I supposed you had, but they do not come out, dear madame, 
until we are 32 years old. I am sorry that I shall have to disappoint 
you." 

FAIR PUBLICITY 

Things have changed. We have had some of the very finest pub- 
licity all over the country. Occasionally I have seen a picture or two of 
myself, of Brigham Young and others, together with articles regarding 
us, that really if I were on a jury, trying the person who was the posses- 
sor of the face represented by those pictures I am sure I would convict 
him no matter what the charge might be. On the other hand there have 
been better publicity and better articles published about us during this 
centennial celebration than anything I have ever read before, and I am 
very grateful for it. 

I want to pay this tribute to those who have published these articles 
and I expect to acknowledge with thanks the many telegrams that we 
have received. 

OUR PEOPLE RESPECTED 

When I realize that for years and years not a single person from 
Utah was ever able to secure employment in Washington, and that to- 
day we have several hundred of our people employed there, and when 
I realize that the delegate from Utah was expelled years ago, and today 
one of the apostles of the Church is recognized as one of the foremost 
and one of the most outstanding senators in the United States and re- 
spected by the president and his colleagues, I rejoice in this wonderful 
change. 

I rejoice in having had ex-President Taft say to me when I met 
him upon a trip to Washington : "Mr. Grant, you did not call on me the 
last time you were here. Now I want it understood that you are never 
to come to Washington without coming to see me. There is in my heart 
a warm feeling for your people. I have great respect for them and I 
want you to call on me whenever you are here." 

He was in such a condition of ill health that I couldn't call upon 
him the last time I was in Washington. I rejoice in the friendship 
for our people of every president of the United States from President 
Roosevelt down to the present time. 

FRIENDSHIP OF U. S. GRANT 

I rejoice in the friendship of Ulysses S. Grant. He sent out a lot 
of officials whose work and only object seemed to be to destroy our 
people politically and to take away from us the franchise, and do every- 
thing against us that they possibly could. But he came here himself 
and met the people. He saw 20,000 vigorous, fine children on the side 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



187 



hill out near where the Catholic cathedral now stands, waving American 
flags, and young girls all dressed in white singing a song. And as his car- 
riage stopped and they welcomed the president of the United States, he 
said: "Whose children are, those? Are they Mormons?" When he was 
told that they were he said : "I have been lied to outrageously." He went 
home and chopped off the heads of the officials, figuratively speaking, 
whom he had sent out here, and then sent us some good men. To every- 
body who undertook to tell him untruths about us he said : "I have been 
there. I have met them. I know." 

HIGH STANDARDS 

The one thing I rejoice in is that people are beginning to know 
that if we are judged by the standard laid down by the Savior of the 
world they cannot help but respect us. What was the first great com- 
mandment of God? To multiply and replenish the earth. We have a 
higher birthrate, higher than the average of any state in the Union. We 
have a low death rate. I have been engaged in the insurance business 
for 58 years. We have a lower death rate than the great life in- 
surance companies. A wicked people never have a low death rate. We 
have a low divorce rate. We have a low insanity rate. 

ARIZONA PIONEERS 

The ex-governor of Arizona remarked upon one occasion in a pub- 
lic speech that the Mormon pioneers of Utah who had gone over into 
Arizona and settled there, the early pioneers of Arizona, were among 
the choicest and best of people in that state. He said : "In one particu- 
lar they are being robbed of their share of the public moneys of this 
state. In proportion to their numbers they are feeing robbed of 2,500 to 
3,000 per cent of their share of criminal taxes, because they are entitled 
to have 25 or 30 inmates in the state penitentiary and have but one. Then 
again, they are being robbed in that they are entitled to six, seven or 
eight in the insane asylum and they do not have one." 

The very first time I went to Arizona, after hearing this I quoted the 
governor, and the district judge arose in the audience and said : "Mr. 
Grant, I am the district judge. That one was from Apache county and 
he has since been pardoned." 

A year or so after that, Governor Campbell, who was successor to 
Governor Hunt who made the statement that I have quoted, was here at 
a convention of all the governors of the different states. They came into 
our splendid office building to pay respects to the Presidency of the 
Church and as I shook hands with Governor Campbell I told him what 
I had heard that Gov. Hunt had said and of the one person in the state 
penitentiary being pardoned. He said: "That is correct. He was 
from Apache county and he has been pardoned." 

BY (THEIR FRUITS 

When people stop to reflect upon the statement of the Savior : "By 
their fruits ye shall know them," and then examine into the record 



188 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



made by the Latter-day Saints, we are not afraid of the decision that 
shall be made regarding our people. We rejoice that we are becoming 
known for just what we are. 

I know from my contact with people in early days, of the vindic- 
tiveness regarding plural marriage. I have had very many men say: 
"Why, Mr. Grant, it is a crime morally, intellectually and physically 
against the posterity of these polygamous marriages." I have said : "I 
am under the necessity of acknowledging the truth of that statement, 
because I am the last son of the last wife, and I am a horrible example 
intellectually, physically and morally, of the fruits of plural marriage 
among the Mormons." 

I can think of nothing that is more gratifying to me than this won- 
derful change that has come over the people of the world. 

I am reminded of an incident wherein a young man applied for a 
prominent position for which his predecessor had received a salary and 
commission of a little over thirty thousand dollars a year. This was in 
one of the outlying states where the Mormons have but few members in 
comparison with others. In this particular state I do not think we have 
five per cent of the entire population. The man who had the position 
to offer said to the young man : "You are a Mormon ?" 

"Oh, no," said the young man. "I have outgrown that." 

The gentleman said: "Well, we are considering your application 
with others. Come around at a later date." 

In the meantime he sent for the president of the stake and said: 
"What is the matter with that young man?" He thought that by an- 
nouncing that he had outgrown Mormonism he would get the job. "Un- 
less you can vouch for his honesty," said this gentleman to the stake 
president, "he will not get the job. What has he done ?" 

The stake president said : "Well, he has been studying psychology, 
and he thinks he has outgrown Mormonism. But I can say to you that 
I think he is an honorable and energetic young man." 

"Then," said the gentleman, "we will give him the position." 

OBSERVERS OF WORD OF WISDOM 

The word "Mormon" today is a synonym for an honorable, upright, 
sober, industrious person, provided the person who is a Mormon is living 
up to his religion. 

We are fundamentally for prohibition. As Latter-day Saints we 
have as you all know — and if there are any strangers here I announce 
it to them — that we have in our Church what is known as the Word of 
Wisdom, which is a revelation given to Joseph Smith, in which we are 
told to leave hot drinks (and Joseph Smith interpreted "hot drinks" to 
mean tea and coffee) tobacco and liquor alone; that tobacco is not good 
for man, and that liquor is not good for man, except for the washing 
of the body. We are promised that if we obey the Word of Wisdom it 
will give us physical strength, whereby the destroying angel shall pass 
us by as he did the children of Israel. And we are promised that we 
shall have hidden treasures of knowledge if we live in accordance with 
the Word of Wisdom. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



189 



It is only fair to say to our friends who may have honored us 
with their presence here this afternoon that we have more than 1,000 
bishops of wards and presidents of branches in this Church, from Can- 
ada to Mexico, and they each have two counselors, and that each bish- 
opric and branch presidency has a clerk. So that we have more than 
4,000 men in the different wards of this Church who must pledge 
themselves to keep the Word of Wisdom, or we do not install them in 
office. Occasionally men do not live up to their pledges, but unless 
they repent we tender them their resignation and of course they accept 
it, as they cannot help themselves. 

ENDORSE WHAT -LINCOLN SAID 

In addition we have more than one hundred stakes in the Church. 
A stake includes from five to ten or twelve wards. There are a pres- 
ident and two counselors and a high council of twelve and a stake clerk 
in each of these stakes. We have more than 2000 men as officers of 
these stakes who make the same pledge to obey the Word of Wisdom. 
Therefore, so far as we are concerned, we absolutely believe and endorse 
most heartily, always have and always expect to, this remarkable and 
wonderful statement which I am about to read to you, by a man who 
was loved perhaps as much as any man has been while occupying the 
presidential chair of the United States after the war closed. Some ter- 
rible things were said about him just before the war started and while it 
was in progress. Lincoln said : 

"Let every American, every lover of liberty, every well-wisher to his pos- 
terity, swear by the blood of the revolution never to violate in the least particular, 
the laws of the country, and never to tolerate their violation by others. As the 
patriots of seventy-six did to the support of the Declaration of Independence, so 
to the support of the Constitution and laws let every American pledge his life, his 
property and his sacred honor. Let every man remember that to violate the 
law is to trample on the blood of his father, and to tear the charter of his 
own and his children's liberty. Let reverence for the law be breathed by every 
American mother to the lisping babe that prattles on her lap. Let it be taught in 
schools, in seminaries, and in colleges. Let it be written in primers, in spelling 
books, and almanacs. Let it be preached from the pulpit, proclaimed in legislative 
halls, and enforced in courts of justice. In short, let it become the political reli- 
gion of the nation." 

As I said before, we are fundamentally in favor of prohibition 
and we feel that any man who violates the prohibition law, the Eighteenth 
Amendment, as long as it is in force, is encouraging anarchy and shows 
a lack of that patriotism which should be in the mind and heart of every 
true American. * 

CONSTITUTION INSPIRED 

I wish to say to our friends who are visiting with us here today, 
that the Latter-day Saints believe and have taught from the beginning 
that God raised up the men who wrote the Constitution of this country ; 
that it was an inspired document, and that the Lord fought on the side of 
our revolutionary fathers. 

It was my privilege to be one of the men who worked to make a 



190 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



success of the Liberty Loan drives. I was chairman of two of the 
drives for the State of Utah, until I became president of the apostles. 
I was present in California at a convention of people known as the Patri- 
otic Committee of One Thousand. And then we had a smaller meeting 
and I was permitted to be a speaker at both of these meetings. In the 
latter meeting there was quite a feeling that it looked as though the ene- 
mies of the United States and of our armies were going to win. These 
men were saying that the outcome looked very dubious. I said : "There 
are some people who have no fear in regard to this matter, and those peo- 
ple are the Mormons. Why? Because we not only believe in the Bible, but 
we believe in the Book of Mormon, as a divinely inspired record, that it 
is the holy scripture of the forefathers of the American Indians, that it 
gives a sacred history of many of their prophets and others. In the 
Book of Mormon we find the statement recorded that this land — America 
— is a land of liberty, choice above all other lands, and that no king shall 
rule here. So we are not afraid of the Kaiser ever winning the war. 
We are convinced that God is on our side in this great conflict. 

TRIBUTE TO JOSEPH SMITH 

I rejoice in the wonderful change that has come and the manifesta 
tion of good will toward our people. We are glad that people are 
beginning to acknowledge that Joseph Smith was a very remarkable and 
wonderful man. Although it has been quoted by me a great many 
times, I am going to close my remarks by quoting from Josiah Quincy 
at one time the mayor of the great city of Boston, a man who was 
acquainted with many leading men of his time. He paid a most remark- 
able tribute to the Prophet Joseph Smith. For the sake of our friends 
who are here as tourists — the Latter-day Saints have heard this quota- 
tion many times — I have decided to read it before the conclusion of my 
remarks here today. 

"It is by no means improbable that some future textbook for the use of 
generations yet unborn will contain a question something like this : What historical 
American of the nineteenth century has exerted the most powerful influence 
upon the destinies of his countrymen? And it is by no means impossible that the 
answer to that interrogatory may be thus written: 'Joseph Smth, the Mormon 
Prophet.' And the reply, absurd as it doubtless seems to most men now living, 
may be an obvious commonplace to their descendants. History deals in surprises 
and paradoxes quite as startling as this. The man who established a religion in 
»this age of free debate, who was and is today accepted by hundreds of thousands 
as a direct emissary from the Most High — such a rare human being is not to be 
disposed of by pelting his memory with unsavory epithets. Fanatic, imposter, 
charlatan, he may have been; but these hard names furnish'no solution to the 
problem he presents to us. Fanatics and imposters are living and dying every 
day, and their memory is buried with them ; but the wonderful influence which 
this founder of a religion exerted and still exerts, throws him into relief before us, 
not as a rogue to be criminated but as a phenomenon to be explained. The most 
vital questions Americans are asking each other today have to do with this 
man and what he has left us. ... A generation other than mine must deal 
with these questions. Burning questions they are, which must give a prominent 
place in the history of the country, to that sturdy self-asserter whom I visited at 
Nauvoo. Joseph Smith, claiming to be an inspired teacher, faced adversity such as 
few men have ever attained, and, finally, forty-three days after I saw him, went 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



191 



cheerfully to a martyr's death. When he surrendered his person to Governor 
Ford, in order to prevent the shedding of blood, the Prophet had a presentiment of 
what was before him. 'I am going like a lamb to the slaughter,' he is reported to 
nave said, 'but I am calm as a summer's morning. I have a conscience void of 
offense and shall die innocent.' I have no theory to advance respecting this extra- 
ordinary man. I shall simply give the facts of my intercourse with him. 

"A tine-looking man is what the passer-by would instinctively have murmured 
upon meeting the remarkable individual who had fashioned the mold which was 
to shape the feelings of so many thousands of his fellow-mortals. But Smith was 
more than this, and one could not resist the impression that capacity and resource 
were natural to his stalwart person. I have already mentioned the resemblance 
he bore to Elisha R. Potter, of Rhode Island, whom I met in Washington in 
1826. The likeness was not such as would be recognized in a picture, but rather 
one that would be felt in a grave emergency. Of all men I have met, these 
two seemed best endowed with that kingly faculty which directs, as by intrin- 
sic right, the feeble or confused souls who are looking for guidance. 

"We then went on to talk of politics. Smith recognized the curse and iniquity 
of slavery, though he opposed the methods of the abolitionists. His plan was for 
the nation to pay for the slaves from the sale of public lands. 'Congress,' he said, 
'should be compelled to take this course, by petitions from all parts of the coun- 
try, but the petitioners must disclaim all alliance with those who would disturb 
the rights of property recognized by the Constitution and which foment insurrec- 
tion.' It may be worth while to remark that Smith's plan was publicly advocated 
eleven years later by one who has mixed so much practical shrewdness with his 
lofty philosophy. In 18SS, when men's minds had been moved to their depths on 
the question of slavery, Ralph Waldo Emerson declared that it should be met in 
accordance 'with the interest of the South and with the settled conscience of the 
North. It is not really a great task, a great fight for this country to accomplish, 
to buy that property of the planter, as the British nation bought the West Indian 
slaves.' He further says that the 'United States will be brought to give every inch 
of their public lands for a purpose like this.' We, who can look back upon the 
terrible cost of the fratricidal war, which put an end to slavery, now say that such 
a solution of the difficulty would have been worthy of a Christian statesman. But 
if the retired scholar was in advance of his time when he advocated this disposi- 
tion of the public property in 1855, what shall I say of the political and religious 
leader who had committed himself, in print, as well as in conversation, to the 
same course in 1844?" 

STATESMANLIKE AND INSPIRED 

We as Latter-day Saints say that God, through his inspired prophet, 
Joseph Smith, pointed the way to save the vast loss of human life, 
the breaking of hearts and the vast waste of money which the rebellion 
brought, by selling public lands to buy the slaves. 

"If the atmosphere of men's opinions was stirred by such a proposition, when 
war-clouds were discernible in the sky, was it not a statesmanlike word, eleven 
years earlier, when the heavens looked tranquil and beneficent?" 

It was a statesmanlike and inspired word from the prophet of the 
living God. 

"Born in the lowest ranks of poverty, without book-learning and with the 
homeliest of all human names, he had made himself at the age of thirty-nine 
a power upon the earth. Of the multitudinous family of Smith, none had so won 
human hearts and shaped human lives as this Joseph. His influence, whether for 
good or for evil, is potent today, and the end is not yet. 

"I have endeavored to give the details of my visit to the Mormon prophet 
with absolute accuracy. If the reader does not know just what to make of Joseph

Smith, I cannot help him out of the difficulty. I myself stand helpless before 
the puzzle." 

All over the wide world the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ has been 
proclaimed by weak humble elders, many of whom have never stood on 
their feet to speak in public before they were sent out into the world. 
Men and women from every denomination, under heaven, every religious 
sect, and in every country where the Gospel has gone, have received the 
witness of the Holy Spirit that Joseph Smith was and is a prophet of the 
true and the living God, and they have sacrificed their families, their 
friends, their homes and their associates. Many of them, in earlier days, 
have been turned out by their families, as things of evil because of the 
testimony that had come into their hearts of the divinity of this work. 

TESTIMONY 

I thank God for the knowledge I possess by the inspiration of his 
Spirit that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God, 
the Redeemer of the world, the Only Begotten of the Father in the flesh. 
And I thank him that I do know that Joseph Smith was a prophet of the 
true and the living God. I rejoice in having had the privilege of bearing 
this testimony from Canada on the north to Mexico on the south, in 
England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Germany, France, Belgium, Holland, 
Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, in the Hawaiian Islands and 
in the far-off land of Japan. May God help me and every Latter-day 
Saint who has a testimony of the divinity of the work in which we are 
engaged to so live that our lives may proclaim the truth of this Gospel, 
is my humble prayer, and I ask it in the name of Jesus Christ, our Re- 
deemer. Amen. 

I want, to say that I have been overwhelmed with gratitude for our 
marvelous and wonderful pageant. My heart goes out in deep gratitude 
to those who have taken part in it, I mentioned it at conference, but I 
want to mention it again today. 

We now have on file more than fifty thousand applications for 
additional tickets to the pageant. I do not know how we are going to 
accommodate all of the people who want to see it. But we rejoice in the 
loyalty and, the patriotism of our choir and of all who have taken part 
in this great pageant. And we are grateful because of the fine reception 
it has had from all of the citizens who have seen it. 

A pageant entitled "The Messages of the Ages" having been presented in the Salt Lake 
Tabernacle, in connection with the celebration of the one hundredth anniversary of the 
organization of the Church, the following article in reference to the pageant was prepared 
by Elder George D. Pyper for publication in thta pamphlet: 

"THE MESSAGE OF THE AGES" 

On April 6th, 1930, in celebration of the one hundredth anniversary 
of the organization of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 
a mammoth production of "The Message of the Ages," a sacred pageant, 
was given in the Tabernacle, Salt Lake City. It was at first intended 
that the production should be given the evenings of only one week ; but 



THE MESSAGE OF THE AGES" 193 



the unusual reception accorded the work by the people made it necessary 
to extend the time one week more and then another and continue until 
May 5th — thirty performances in all. It was a stupendous undertaking 
and surprised and thrilled all who witnessed it. Including the people 
on the stage, choir, orchestra, ushers and assistants, fifteen hundred 
people took part in the performances. It is estimated that approximately 
two hundred thousand people saw the pageant. 

The members of the pageant committee, who prepared and staged 
the collossal affair are as follows: George D. Pyper, former manager 
of the Salt Lake Theatre, and second assistant General Superintendent 
of the Deseret Sunday School Union, chairman ; W. O. Robinson, Field 
Secretary, Young Men's Mutual Improvement Association ; Junius- F. 
Wfells, member Young Men's Mutual Improvement Board (who died 
April 18th, while the pageant was in progress) ; Elbert H. Eastmond, 
professor of art, Brigham Young Universitty, Provo ; Charlotte Stewart, 
City Recreational Superintendent, member General Board of Y. L. M. 
I. A. ; Irma Felt Bitner of the Community Activity Board, Granite 
stake; Ann Nebeker of the General Board Primary Association; An- 
thony C. Lund, Conductor Salt Lake Tabernacle Choir ; Tracy Y. Can- 
non, Tabernacle Organist and member Deseret Sunday School Union 
Board ; Frank W. Asper, Tabernacle Organist ; Bertha A. Kleinman, 
Secretary Arizona Temple ; Leroy Robertson of the Music Department 
B. Y. U., Provo, and A. Hamer Reiser, Secretary, member Deseret Sun- 
day School Union Board. 

The Pageant Committee worked under the Church Centennial com- 
mittee consisting of Elder George Albert Smith, chairman ; Elders David 
O. McKay, Joseph Fielding Smith, Melvin J. Ballard, B. H. Roberts, 
Rulon S. Wells, Sylvester Q. Cannon, with Leroi C. Snow, secretary. 
The epic readers were Joseph F. Smith and Lynn Richards; the lyric 
readers, Maud May Babcock, Mrs. Grace Nixon Stewart and Mrs. Algie 
Eggertson Ballif. 

Others were called upon to aid in the work and gave their time gra- 
tuitously. 

The aim of the pageant is given in the explanatory note printed in 
the official program, which reads as follows : 

" 'The Message of the Ages' is a presentation of the outstanding 
features of the Lord's dealings with man in this world existence. 

"Be it known that the Gospel, planned in the councils of heaven, 
was known to the ancients, preached by Christ in the Meridian of Time, 
and, after a great falling away, this same Gospel was again revealed to 
the Prophet Joseph Smith and restored in these last days, a century ago, 
and through the martyrdom of the Prophet and the faith and patience 
and heroic toil of his people, 'the Lord hath brought again Zion,' and 
established her among the hills, and that by walking in his ways, the chil- 
dren of men may find peace and happiness and the 'more abundant 
life.' 

"The Pageant is divided into a prologue and three periods, viz : 
The Ancient Dispensations, The Messianic Dispensation, and The Dis-

pensation of the Fulness of Times. The story is told in narrative tab- 
leau and processional, with organ, orchestral and choral music." The plan 
and compilation of thp scriptural texts taken from the Bible, Book of 
Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants and Pearl of Great Price, were the 
work of the Pageant committee. The poetical text wq.s written by Mrs. 
Bertha A. Kleinman of Mesa, Arizona; who quoted quite exten- 
sively from the poetry of Elder Orson F. Whitney and included in her 
work a poem by Theodore F. Curtis. 

The Pageant begins with a fanfare of trumpets and musical motif 
written by Leroy Robertson of the Brigham Young University musical 
staff. These are used at the beginning of each dispensation. Then fol- 
lows a reading giving an account of the Council in Heaven, the plan of 
salvation, the selection of Christ the First Born as the Savior of the 
world, and the war in heaven resulting in Satan's being cast down, tak- 
ing with him one-third of the hosts of heaven who became the evil 
spirits that tempt the children of men. 

The first scene is a mystic representation of the Creation of the 
world and while this is being shown the great chorus sings a part of 
"The Creation," by Haydn, with solos by Wallace Bennett and James 
H. Haslam. Following this is shown Adam and Eve in the garden of 
Eden offering sacrifice, with the explanation of it as given in the Pearl 
of Great Price. 

The story of the flood is told, ending with an inspiring tableau 
of Noah and his sons and their families, the ark and the bow of promise. 

The children of Israel in Egypt are shown in bondage and in or- 
nate and "carnal sumptuousness." Upon the scene comes Moses from 
the burning bush. Here a stage full of hundreds of people in colorful 
costumes march through the wilderness to the foot of Sinai where the 
voice of God speaks forth the Ten Commandments, spoken from behind 
the scene by Elder John M. Knight. Following this, reaching across 
the mammoth stage, is revealed a frieze of the ancient seers, prophets, 
judges and kings of the old and new worlds. These are introduced 
through the graceful draperies with titles briefly embodying the char- 
acter and mission of each. With the opening of the draperies and the 
tableau curtain these characters form part of a composite picture depict- 
ing the adoration of the Ages, the Nativity, the Magi, the Shepherds and 
"His other sheep" on the Western Hemisphere. Music from Handel's 
"The Messiah" is sung with solo by Emma Lucy Gates Bowen. This is 
followed by an impressive representation of the Sermon on the Mount, 
the voice coming through a brilliant light, the beatitudes being spoken 
by Elder Winslow F. Smith. The Messianic Dispensation closes with 
a recital of the Lord's passion and a tableau of the resurrection accom- 
panied by Mascagni's magnificent Easter anthem "The Lord Now Vic- 
torious." 

Part I of the Dispensation of the Fulness of Times opens with a 
prelude showing the apostasy, the spurning of the prophets, the famine 
for the word of God, and the search for truth. The reading is accom- 
panied by orchestral music from "The Restoration" by Brigham Cecil 



"THE MESSAGE OF THE AGES" 



195 



Gates, and the singing of part of "The Nations Bow to Satan's Thrall," 
an anthem by Joseph J. Daynes. In quick succession come the pic- 
tures of the restoration. First is depicted the boy prophet, praying in 
the Sacred Grove. The appearance of the holy Beings is represented 
by brilliant shafts of light. The chorus sings the third verse of "Joseph 
Smith's First Prayer" (words by George Manwaring, music by A. C. 
Smyth) and then the Voice of the Lord is heard again— "Joseph, this 
is My Beloved Son, Hear Him.*' The fourth verse of "Joseph Smith's 
First Prayer" follows and the scene closes with motif, fanfare and cho- 
rus, "The Morning Breaks, the Shadows Flee." (Words by Parley P. 
Pratt, music by George Careless.) After this the Angel Moroni is seen 
delivering the golden plates of the "Book of Mormon" to Joseph Smith ; 
and while he peruses the record a gorgeous procession of the ancient 
peoples of this continent passes in vision across the stage, to the choral 
accompaniment of "An Angel from on High," (words by W. W. Phelps, 
music by John Tullidge.) 

Then follow picturizations of the restoration of the Aaronic Priest- 
hood by John the Baptist, of the Melchizedek Priesthood by Peter, James 
and John, the organization of the Church, the appearance of Moses, 
Elias and Elijah to Joseph and Oliver, and the restoration of the Gos- 
pel in its fulness. 

"With keys to bind and seal and ratify 
For time on earth and for eternity." 

Part I of the Dispensation of the Fulness of Times closes with a 
representation of the Elders taking the Gospel message to the world. 
A male chorus sings "See the Mighty Angel Flying," by Evan Stephens. 

Part II of the last dispensation opens with an epochal reading, 
with orchestral accompaniment, relating the momentous events of the 
Church history including the move from Kirtland to Nauvoo, the Proph- 
et Joseph's vision of the West, his tragic martyrdom, the singing of 
"Hail to the Prophet," and the selection of Brigham Young as his suc- 
cessor. The ,curtain is raised to an apostrophe to the hymn, "Come, 
Come Ye Saints," and reveals in tableau four stages of the western 
trek : the Mormon Battalion, a camp on the plains, scouting through the 
mountains, and the first glimpse of Salt Lake valley. As the chorus 
sings the pioneer song, the bas-relief becomes animated and depicts the 
entrance into the valley and the beginning of community building. Their 
trail is followed by other companies with handcarts and afoot. The house 
lights go up and the congregation sings "O Ye Mountains High" (words 
by Charles W. Penrose.) 

In scene two the curtain rises upon a plastique — a graven statue in 
stone representing the composite fundamentals of the community life 
of the Latter-day Saints — Church, home, school, work and play. To this 
conception of community life in the valleys of the mountains come the 
folk from all nations, tongues and peoptej preceded by the reading of the 
prophecy of Isaiah 2 :2-4, and the following lines : 

"Across the seven seas Thy children come 
From every land and island of the deep,

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



To merge their boundried nationality 

And rear a lasting empire unto Thee. 

Of such as these, the salt of all the earth, 

And as they wend in hallowed pilgrimage 

May grace of Thine enfold and lead them on 

To lave their souls in Truth's resplendant flame. 

This group, made up mostly of natives of the countries where the 
Gospel has been preached, enters to the inspiring "March Heroique" by 
Saint Saens and the curtain falls on a tableau showing the nations merged 
in one united people. 

The finale is a tableau symbolizing the activities of the Church — 
Priesthood, Temple and Genealogical Groups — Relief Society — Sunday 
School — Mutual Improvement Associations — Primary. 

The epic and lyric readings in the closing scene are a song of 
praise for the centenary of truth, a pledge to carry on, and a prayer for 
the benediction of the Lord on all the world, "till welded nations cease 
from strife, to learn the way, the truth, the life." 

"Thus in Thy handiwork, O Zion's God, Behold what Priesthood's miracle hath 
wrought ! 

From worlds primeval to the ends of Time — the Message of the Ages stand 
revealed !" 

The chorus then sings "The Voice of God is Heard Again," at the 
conclusion of which the congregation, with hands outstretched toward 
the light, joins the choir in singing: 

"Praise God from whom all blessings flow, 
Praise Him all creatures here below 
Praise Him above, ye heavenly host, 
Praise Father, Son and Holy Ghost."

All Students ot the Book of 
Mormon 

WILL FIND THE BOOK 

An Introduction to the Study of 
the Book of Mormon 

By J. M. SJODAHL 
To be mighty interesting and illuminating 

"Some at the content* ot the book has appeared in the IMPROVEMENT ERA. and 
other Church publications during the last ten years, and friends have been good 
enough to say, repeatedly, that they would be glad to have those contributions in some 
form more convenient for reference. Acting on their suggestion, I hare collected 
some papers previously published and others that now appear for the first time, and 
respectfully submit them in this form to the public In doing so, it is my sincere 
prayer that the testimony here offered may be of benefit to the reader, and especially 
to honest seekers after the truth." 

Price $3.50 



"Time is the supreme test of a prophecy. He who undertakes to foretell 
events must know that Time In its merciless pursuit will find him put. Of all the 
pretenses of the false prophet, prophesying is the most hazardous... Religious impostors 
often display qualities of leadership in controlling the affairs of their followers. The 
more modest their pretenses, however, the more likely are they to escape detection 
and exposure. But when spiritual leaders assume to exercise the exalted function 
of prophecy, and have the courage to publish their prophecies, they place their reputa- 
tions before the bar of the world, and as the weight of Time presses ont the vintage 
of the centuries they must sink to a deserving oblivion or be exalted to a place in the 
skies. Time is a foe of Fraud, but the never-failing friend of Truth. 

Now that the claims of Joseph Smith as prophet have been set up before the 
world for a century, it is proper that the verdict of Time should be ascertained. To 
disclose these findings, this volume is given out. Only a few of the well-known 
prophecies are here considered. 

All this is clearly set forth in

What All the World Believes 

This work embraces an account of the Bibles and Beliefs of Mankind; the 
Faiths of every age and every land being presented impartially, each from Its own 
historical standpoint. 

The chapters on the Scriptures of the World, and the digest by religions of the 
most notable Parliament utterances, are from the pen of the Kev. Edward C. Towne, 
B. A., whose broad scholarship and great knowledge of the World's Religions Systems 
was fittingly recognized in his selection as one of the principal editors of the Official 
Report of the World's Parliament of All Religions. These chapters offer for the first 
time to the general reader a concise, connected, yet scholarly view of all the Bibles of 
Mankind, and of the various beliefs as to the inspiration under which remarkable 
writings have been held to be Sacred Scriptures.

Holy Scripture 

INCLUDING THE APOCRYPHA 

Edited by Bishop Gore, D. D* Formerly Bishop of Oxford; H. L. Goudge, D. Dm 
Regius Professor of Divinity, Oxford; A. Guillaume, Professor of Hebrew and 
Semitic Languages, Durham. 

This great work of scholarship stands out from its predecessors in several ways: 

(1) In the distinction of its chief editor, who had done so much to reconcile 
the old faith with the new knowledge. 

(2) In the unity which the volume achieves owing to the fact that the bulk 
of the contributions are by scholars in agreement with the general 
outlook of the editor, who in addition has worked over the whole 
material and left upon It the impress of his unrivalled experience. 

(t) In the generous amount of space given to the exegesis of the important 
books. 

(4) In the inclusion of the Apocrypha, and the consequent bridging of the 

gap between the two Testaments. 
(6) In the ease and convenience with which it can be used, despite its 1110 

pages and million and a quarter words.

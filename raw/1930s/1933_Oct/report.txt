A THRILLING STORY 

of Century One of 

CHURCH HISTORY 

MERE is a new story of "Mormonism," told with a com- 
pleteness and charm that will thrill Latter-day Saints 
with a pride of achievement and at the same time 
win the admiration of the critic, be he friend or foe. In a 
COMPREHENSIVE HISTORY OF THE CHURCH, B. H. 
Roberts has done a masterful piece of research and has set 
down the record of Century One— 1830 to 1930— in a bril- 
liant appraisal of momentous events. The reader with a 
sentimental interest will be fascinated with this narrative 
of truth stranger than fiction ; the reader who approaches 
the new work with the critical vision of the historian will 
find it fair in statement, authentic in fact, copious in detail 
and sound in judgment. 

A COMPREHENSIVE HISTORY OF THE CHURCH was 
written by Elder Roberts at the instance of the First Presi- 
dency of the Church, with a commission to make it exhaus- 
tively complete, from the remotest beginnings to the close 
of the Centennial Conference of April 6, 1930. The final 
volume ends with an account of the Conference itself, mak- 
ing the history technically inclusive of all that happened in 
Century One of the organized existence of the Church. Thus 
it is a fitting commemoration of one hundred years of strug- 
gle and achievement. 

This monumental work is not to be confused with any former 
history, journal or chronicle. Though its nucleus is the his- 
tory of "Mormonism" published a few years ago in 
AMERICANA, running serially for six years through that 
magazine, yet this History is NEW— new in its wealth of 
material, new in method of treatment and new in its physical 
representation of the book maker's art.

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

The hymn, "Come, come, ye Saints," the great pioneer song with, 
the many memories it brings to me every time I hear it, has changed 
my program today. 

The first thing I am going to read will be from section 136 of the 
Doctrine and Covenants. This is "the word and will of the Lord" given 
to President Brigham Young: 

"And if any man shall seek to build up himself, and seeketh not my counsel, 
he shall have no power, and his folly shall be made manifest. 

"Seek ye; and keep all your pledges one with another and covet not that which 
is thy brother's." 

AVOID COVETOUSNESS 

I cannot think of anything that appeals to me as being the mind and 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 5 

the will of the Lord stronger-than the last words that I have read, namely : 
"Covet not that which is thy brother's." 

I want to impress upon the minds of the Latter-day Saints not to 
covet that which belongs to any public institution, or that which belongs 
to any city, or county, or the governinent of the United States, Unless I 
have been misinformed, many people have said, speaking of the distribu- 
tion by the government of supplies to the people: "Well, others are 
getting some, why should not I get some of it." 

FORTY-FIVE YEARS AGO AND NOW 

I believe that there is a growing disposition among the people to 
try to get something from the government of the United States with 
little hope of ever paying it back. I think this is all wrong. I believe 
that there is not that same moral sense among the people today that 
there was forty-five years ago. Forty-five years ago I was associated 
in business with my brother and my cousin-in-law, and the first year we 
sold a hundred and twenty thousand dollars worth of goods, and ninety 
thousand dollars worth of those goods were sold on time to the farmers. 
We borrowed the money to carry these debts, and we netted $100.50 for 
every one hundred dollars we had trusted the farmers. The loss was 
only $300 and the interest received paid this, and fifty cents per hundred 
more. 

I am connected with that same company now, and it is known as 
the Consolidated Wagon and Machine Company. During the past few 
years we have had to charge off over one million dollars of loss on 
farmers' paper. I do not attribute all of this to a lack of honesty, but 
there are a great many people who are not honest today. 

I remember very distinctly that while I was in Europe J. M. Stude- 
baker visited Salt Lake and was interviewed. He was the last of that 
quartette of wonderful men, the Studebaker brothers, who made buggies 
and wagons. He said that the only State or Territory in the union of 
the United States where they had sold wagons and buggies on time for 
ten long years, and where every wagon and buggy was paid for in full, 
was in Utah. That was a marvelous compliment to the people of Utah. 

SHOULD KEEP PLEDGES 

Remember that it is the mind and will of the Lord that we keep 
our pledges. 

"Keep yourselves from evil to take the name of the Lord in vain, for I am the 
Lord your God, even the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham and of Isaac 
and of Jacob. 

"I am he who led the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt, and my arm 
is stretched out in the last days to save my people Israel. 

"Cease to contend one with another ; cease to speak evil one of another." 

FAULT FINDING DENOUNCED 

A growing evil among our people is to criticise and find fault. I 
think there is no hymn in the hymn book that I prize more highly — and 



6 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

it was the first one that I learned by heart — than "Should you feel 
inclined to censure" : 

"Should you feel inclined to censure 
Faults you may in others view, 
Ask your own heart, ere you venture, 
If that has not failings too. 

Let not friendly vows he broken ; 
Rather strive a friend to gain; 
Many a word in anger spoken 
Finds its passage home again. 

Do not, then, in idle pleasure, 
Trifle with a brother's fame, 
Guard it as a valued treasure. 
Sacred as your own good name. 

Do not form opinions blindly; 
Hastiness 1 to trouble tends. 
Those of whom we thought unkindly, 
Oft become our warmest friends." 

Learn it by heart. You will find it on page 66 of our old hymn 
book. You cannot forget the page — 'the 6th of April and the 6th of 
October make 66 — so when you go home don't say you cannot remember 
it, because you cannot forget that number if you try. Learn it by heart 
and put it into your lives, and it will be valuable to you. 

"Cease drunkenness; and let your words tend to edifying one another." 

DANGER IN REPEAL 

Let me promise you right here and now that if you vote for the 
repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment, there will be a great many more 
professing Latter-day Saints who will be drunkards than there have 
been while the Eighteenth Amendment has been in force. 

By the way, I received a postal card — the man who sent it did not 
have the courage to sign his name — asking me not to talk on the Word 
of Wisdom at this conference. I request each and every Latter-day 
Saint within the sound of my voice to read what I said about the Word 
of Wisdom just six months ago. Every word that I said I meant, and 
among other things I said I hoped and prayed that we as a people would 
not vote for the repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment. Really, I was 
almost tempted this morning to read my whole sermon over again, and 
let it go at that, I think I shall have it printed — in fact I will have it 
printed, and anyone of you who wants a copy, or a half dozen copies of it, 
can write and get them. 

"If thou borrowest of thy neighbor — " Let me add, or anybody elste — "thou 
shalt restore that which thou hast borrowed ; and if thou canst not repay then go 
straightway and tell thy neighbor, lest he condemn thee." 

AVOID BANKRUPTCY 

That is one of the finest verses that was ever written, and please 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 7 

remember that this I am reading is "the word and the will of the Lord." 
In other words, do not take the bankruptcy act unless somebody knocks 
you down. All of my dear friends, many years ago when I was ruined 
in their judgment beyond the peradventure of a doubt, and there was 
no possibility, as far as they were able to see, of my ever being able 
to pay my debts, begged me to take the bankruptcy act. I said : "Not if 
I live a hundred and ten years. I will go on paying." And in the 
providences of the Lord I paid all of my debts. 

Now, I am not condemning those who have to take the bankruptcy 
act; but I know of men whom I have begged and pleaded with to not 
take the bankruptcy act, who, if they had only had the nerve, the faith, 
and the willingness to work, would have come out all right. One man 
took the bankruptcy act and left me carrying his obligation as I recall 
of $12,700, with $9,000 security, or a loss of $3,700. But eventually 
I made a profit of several thousand more than $3,700 by assuming the 
debt and carrying the securities for a few years. 

REVELATIONS FROM THE LORD 

"If thou shalt find that which thy neighbor has lost, thou Shalt make diligent 
search till thou shalt deliver it to him again. 

"Thou shalt be diligent in preserving what thou hast," — in other words, do 
not be wasteful — "that thou mayest be a wise steward ; for it is the free gift of 
the Lord thy God, and thou art his steward." 

I commend to you that you read all of that section. I have read 
only verses 19 to 27, I will read one more verse : 

"If thou art merry, praise the Lord with singing, with music, with dancing, 
and with a prayer of praise and thanksgiving." 

One of the great testimonies to me of the divinity of the work 
in which you and I are engaged is the revelations that were given before 
the Church was organized, and that are recorded in the Doctrine and 
Covenants. I commend that you read all of the very first section of 
the Doctrine and Covenants. It is a very wonderful section indeed. I 
have decided to read a few verses of it : 

"And the arm of the Lord shall be revealed; and the day cometh that they 
who will not hear the voice of the Lord, neither the voice of his servants, neither 
give heed to the words of the prophets and apostles, shall be cut off from among 
the people." 

* * * * 

"Search these commandments, for they are true and faithful, and the proph- 
ecies and promises which are in them shall all be fulfilled. 

"What I the Lord have spoken, I have spoken, and I excuse not myself; and 
though the heavens 1 and the earth pass away, my word shall not pass away, but shall 
all be fulfilled, whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants, it is the 
same." 

REVELATION TO PROPHET'S FATHER 

Section 4 of the Doctrine and Covenants is a revelation given to 
the father of the Prophet Joseph Smith, in February, 1829, a year before 
the Church was organized : 



8 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

"Now behold, a marvelous work is about to oome forth among the children 
of men. 

"Therefore, O ye that embark in the service of God ; see that ye serve him 
with all your heart, might, mind and strength, that ye may stand blameless before 
God at the last day. 

"Therefore, if ye have desires to serve God ye are called to the work; 

"For behold the field is white already to harvest ; and lo, he that thrusteth in 
his 1 sickle with his might, the same layeth up in store that he perisheth not, but 
bringeth salvation to his soul ; 

"And faith, hope, charity, and love, with an eye single to the glory of God, 
qualify him for the work. 

"Remember faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, brotherly kindness, 
godliness, charity, humility, diligence. 

"Ask, and ye shall receive; knock, and it shall be opened unto you." 

"white already to harvest" 

Many of these revelations given before the Church was organized 
announced- that the field was white already to harvest. 

When I stop to think that Wilf ord Woodruff baptized some eighteen 
hundred people in less than a year in Herefordshire, England, and that 
Orson Pratt baptized several thousand people in his missionary work, 
I realize that the field was indeed ready to harvest. 

We have had as high as twenty-three hundred missionaries out in 
the field for one year, and they did not accomplish as much as Wilford 
Woodruff accomplished in one year. His labors were simply marvelous 
to me. The field was "white, ready to harvest." 

Today is a day of gleaning. 

"THOU SHALT NOT BE IDLE" 

I read now from section 42, 42nd to 46th verses : 

"Thou shalt not be idle ; for he that is idle shall not eat the bread nor wear 
the garments of the laborer." 

I heard of a case of a man and his wife and their boy calling on 
the governor of the'state who had a job for the boy. I believe that the 
amount he was to receive was thirty dollars a month. The man and 
the woman said : "Our boy shall not work for thirty dollars a month. 
We will beg first ; we will steal first." I hope that this story has been 
exaggerated. Thirty dollars a month when I was a child would have 
been a fortune. I am sure that my dear departed mother took care 
of herself and me on one-half of that amount. We did not have any 
butter on our bread, however. We did not sit up nights and have a fire 
burning, because we could not afford it. We went to bed very early. 
Why? Because we had plenty of bed clothes. 

"And whosoever among you are sick, and have not faith to be healed, but 
believe, shall be nourished with all tenderness, with herbs and mild food, and that 
not by the hand of an enemy. 

"And the elders of the Church, two or more, shall be called, and shall pray 
for and lay their hands upon them in my name; and if they die they shall die 
unto me, and if they live, they shall live unto me. 

"Thou shalt live together in love, insomuch that thou shalt weep for the loss 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 9 

of them that die, and more especially for those that have not a hope of a glorious 
resurrection. 

"And it shall come to pass that those that die in me shall not taste of death, 
for it shall be sweet unto them." 

I now read from section 88, verses 124 and 125 : 

"Cease to be idle ; cease to be unclean ; cease to find fault one with another ; 
cease to sleep longer than is needful ; retire to thy bed early, that ye may not be 
weary ; arise early, that your bodies and your minds may be invigorated. 

"And above all things, clothe yourselves with the bond of charity, as with a 
mantle, which is the bond of perfectness and peace." 

I now read from section 58, verses 26 to 29: 

"For behold, it is not meet that I should command in all things ; for he that 
is compelled in all things, the same is a slothful and not a wise servant ; wherefore 
he receiveth no reward. 

"Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause and do many 
things of their own free will, and bring to pass" much righteousness ; 

"For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves. And 
inasmuch as men do good they shall in nowise lose their reward." 

"mind and will" of god 

I have heard any number of Latter-day Saints say, "Why, the 
Word of Wisdom is not a commandment." What does the Word of 
Wisdom say? That it is the mind and the will of the Lord. And why 
was it given? "In consequence of evils and designs which do and will 
exist in the hearts of conspiring men in the last days," and a more 
damnable and evil design was never in the heart of any man than the 
advertisements that we see on the billboards showing a beautiful woman 
with an engagement or wedding ring, the smoke of the cigarette making 
the ring. 

What is the purpose of these advertisements? To get money by 
selling cigarettes to destroy the mind and the body and the intelligence 
of boys and girls. I get hot in the collar, as the saying is, every time I 
think of the millions upon millions, and the billions upon billions, of 
cigarettes that are consumed. 

A SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM 

Do you want to know how to obtain temporal salvation? Not 
only the Latter-day Saints, but all the world would have the solution of 
that problem if there were no tea, coffee, liquor nor tobacco used in the 
world. Peace, prosperity, and happiness would come to the entire world. 

I now read from section 130: 

"Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with 
us in the resurrection. 

"And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through 
his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in 
the world to come." 

I know of no one of our general authorities Who has studied more 
or was better posted — 1 know of no one of them who has been a greater 



10 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

promulgator of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, than were the two men who 
were with us six months ago — James E. Talmage, and Brigham H. 
Roberts — who have since passed away. They will go on progressing 
beyond the grave and using that marvelous store of knowledge and 
information that they had gained. We miss them, the whole Church 
will miss them. 

BLESSINGS PROMISED 

"There is 1 a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven, before the foundations of 
this world, upon which all blessings are predicated." 

Spiritual and temporal salvation, with the destroying angel passing 
us by will come from observing the Word of Wisdom. It would solve 
ail the problems of the Latter-day Saints, and of the nation, and of 
the world, if it were obeyed. Notwithstanding the fact that this 
anonymous Latter-day Saint asked me not to say anything about the 
Word of Wisdom, as I said before, you can read nearly an hour's sermon 
about it if you will read my sermon preached in this tabernacle six 
months ago. 

May the Lord bless and inspire all who shall speak during the con- 
ference. May we grow in the light and knowledge of the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ. May each and every one of us who has a testimony of the 
divinity of the work in which we are engaged so live it in honesty in 
the daily affairs of life, so live it in energy and not in idleness, and so 
live it that those seeing our good deeds may be led to investigate the 
Gospel and receive that sweet and wonderful testimony that gives us a 
knowledge of the divinity of the mission and the Godliness of the mission 
of Jesus Christ our Savior and our Redeemer, is my humble prayer, and 
I ask it in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

Sister Mirl Lindsay rendered a solo, "The eternity of love." 

ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

Brethren and sisters, I stand before you in the depths of humility. 
I did not receive an inkling that my name would be presented this morn- 
ing, and I feel one of the weakest of God's creatures. 

The first miraculous manifestation I received when I was a youth 
was through President Heber J. Grant when he delivered a sermon in 
Coalville in the Summit Stake of Zion. The President, whom I dearly 
love, has always made a profound impression upon me in my life. I 
love all of the General Authorities of the Church. I know that they are 
men of God. I know, too, as sure as I stand here that Jesus is the 
Christ, the Son of the living God. I know by the same power that 
Joseph Smith is a prophet of God. I am in absolute harmony with all 
that the General Authorities of the Church have done. 

Brethren and sisters, I desire to spend my time in your service. 



ELDER DAVID O. McKAY 11 

God help me to always be faithful and humble, and to always love his 
people and his work, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER DAVID O. McKAY 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

My brethren and sisters, I wish first to express my delight in the 
choice that has been made to fill the vacancies in the Council of the 
Twelve and in the First Council of the Seventy, as presented here this 
morning by President Grant. I have known President Callis and 
President John H. Taylor for many years. I have labored with Brother 
Callis in the mission field, have had his confidence, and know him to be a 
man of God, one who will give his life if necessary for the truth. 

I have been closely associated with Brother Taylor in the Missionary 
Home. I know his integrity to the truth. I know his reliability and 
soundness. I know he comprehends as few men comprehend the needs 
of missionaries. It is highly fitting for him to be called into the First 
Council of the Seventy, the special mission of which is to direct the 
missionary work of the Church and to instruct the Seventies of the 
Church as missionaries. I congratulate the Church upon these appoint- 
ments. I know Sister Callis and Sister Taylor, and know them to be 
wise women, worthy to share the great honor that has come to their 
husbands. They are faithful and true and capable. God bless these 
brethren and sisters in the great responsibility that has come to them. 

ME WORTH OF THE INDIVIDUAL 

"Remember the worth of souls." This divine admonition suggests 
the topic about which I desire to speak; namely, The Worth of the 
Individual. 

If, as it has been said, the babe "is the center of the universe," then 
man is the center of all social activity. "Man is the jewel of God, who 
has created this material world to keep His treasure in." This is just 
another way of saying that the earth was created for man and not man 
for the earth. 

/ am one of those who believe that all institutions and organizations 
exist primarily for the purpose of securing to the individual his rights, 
his happiness and proper development of his character. As soon as 
organizations fail to accomplish this purpose their usefulness ceases. 
"So act," says Kant, "as to treat humanity, whether in your own person 
or that of another, in every case as an end, never as a means only." 

In all ages of the world men have been prone to ignore the person- 
ality of others, to disregard men's rights by closing against them the 
opportunity to develop. The worth of man is a good measuring rod by 
which we may judge of the rightfulness or wrongfulness of a policy or 
principle whether in government, in business or social affairs. 

THE ARISTOCRACY OF BRUTE FORCE 

Taking a long glance at the world's history with its confused mass 



12 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

of tangled events, we can glimpse an ever-increasing group momentum 
in favor of the rights of the individual. There was a time even since his- 
tory began, when men were ruled by the aristocracy of brute force. 
Under this condition developed such group powers as the Huns, who 
ruled at one time all peoples between the Caspian and the Chinese borders. 
Under this power the masses were but serfs. Indeed all conquered 
groups were compelled to pay tribute to the conquerors. Those who 
refused were either subdued or exterminated. At one time, for example, 
the entire region between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean was 
laid waste. A good illustration of "man's inhumanity to man." 

THE ARISTOCRACY OF BIRTH 

Centuries passed and we find the world governed principally by the 
aristocracy of birth. This ruling power was climaxed in the declaration 
of the weak king, James the Sixth of Scotland, who became James the 
First of England, and who made the declaration that kings rule by divine 
right. Under this regime also, the individual who represents the masses 
was but a vassal whose principal right to existence in the mind of the 
ruling class was to pay tribute. For eleven years, Charles the First, son 
of James the First, contrary to the spirit and express declaration of the 
Magna Charta, ruled without a parliament. His tyrannical usurpation 
of power and his refusal to recognize the rights of his subjects proved 
his undoing. 

THE ARISTOCRACY OF WEALTH 

However, the aristocracy of birth has crumbled. Thrones of 
Emperors and Kings are today unoccupied. Titles may be bought for 
the fourth of a common fortune, or for the wealth of an actress. In the 
meantime there has arisen in the world another centralized power which 
may be called the aristocracy of wealth, in which success and influence 
seem in proportion to the amount a man possesses. Under that regime 
big business seems more concerned about raising the value of things 
than in raising the standard of living. Men are used to make money 
instead of money being used to make men. Of course, man is the 
ultimate means of wealth, but this personal power should not be exploited 
by any man or force advantageously situated. 

We are living in an age of changing opinions, of swiftly shifting 
human relations. Man's wisdom seems baffled. In all our readjustments, 
plans and policies we cannot do better than keep in mind the divine 
admonition that the worth of souls is great in the sight of God. 

THE END OF ALL SOCIAL DEVELOPMENTS 

There has been no little discussion as to whether the individual or 
society is the great end of all social developments. "From the Christian 
point of view there needs be no hesitancy in the answer so far as man 
is concerned. The saved individual is the supreme end of the Divine 
Will." 



ELDER DAVID O. McKAY 13 

Jesus always sought the welfare of the individual, and individuals 
grouped and laboring for the mutual welfare of the whole in conformity 
with the principles of the Gospel constitute the Kingdom of God. Many 
of the choicest truths of the Gospel were given in conversations with 
individuals. It was while Jesus talked with Nicodemus that He gave 
us the message relative to baptism and being born again. From the 
conversation with the woman of Samaria we have disclosed the truth 
that they who worship God must worship in spirit and in truth. From 
that with Mary and Martha we get the divine declaration, "I am the 
resurrection, and the life; he that believeth in me, though he were 
dead, yet shall he live." 

Jesus' regard for personality was supreme. When the Pharisees 
dragged into his presence the woman taken in adultery, Christ saw 
through the soul that had been stained with sin the personality that 
still contained the spark of hope, which He kindled into a light that 
warmed and guided a personality back to confidence and perhaps to 
righteousness. 

THE PRESENT POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC SITUATION 

I said that we are living in an age of shifting uncertainties. Re- 
cently I saw an expressive cartoon which depicted an engine on an old 
railroad track, from which a train loaded with people was being pulled 
in another direction by a tractor which had left the rails and started 
out over an unbeaten track. The President of the United States was 
the engineer. It is expressive of our political and economic situation today. 
Some of us may not know just where we are going, but we are trusting 
our leader. 

To policies and legislation now proposed for the purpose of lifting 
the country out of the quagmire of depression, let us in the spirit of 
tolerance apply the test of The Worth of Souls. Two of these policies 
are The National Recovery Act, and Prohibition. 

THE NATIONAL RECOVERY ACT 

Of this one thing we are certain, that the dominating spirit of the 
movement expressed in the blue emblem of the National Recovery Act 
has as its impelling motive the good of the individual. It is reaching 
out to alleviate suffering and to make brighter the life of every unfortu- 
nate. Vast sums of money are being appropriated to make better the 
condition of every citizen in the United States. That motive is sound. 
It conforms to the measuring rod of the individual and, therefore, de- 
serves the hearty support of every loyal American. 

DEBASING TO MANHOOD 

I wish I could say as much of the Anti-Prohibition movement. 
Many who are favoring the repeal of the 18th Amendment sincerely 
believe repeal of sumptuary laws will foster greater temperance. Others, 
however, lay much stress upon the fact that if our prohibition laws are 



14 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

repealed we shall have more revenue. In this latter case money seems 
to take precedence over manhood. I have no objection to any effort, 
indeed, I favor every means to turn into the natural channels of govern- 
ment wealth which has heretofore been flowing to bootleggers and other 
lawbreakers. But while that is commendable I cannot lose sight of the 
fact that traffic in alcoholic drinks and the indulgence in intoxicating 
liquors are debasing to manhood. That which does not contribute 
to the need, to the comfort, to the happiness of the individuals should 
be banished from society at whatever monetary expenditure. "Absti- 
nence from the use of alcohol or drugs and purity in the sex relations 
are fundamental determinants of our efficiency, whether mental, moral, 
or physical." If the majority of the thinking men and women in the 
United States agree that prohibition is not the best way to handle this 
evil, then mark what I say, some method of control must be devised 
and assumed not only by the States but by the Federal Government or 
the Cause of Temperance will be set back twenty-five years. It is my 
personal opinion that traffic in intoxicating liquor should be placed in 
the same category as traffic in morphine and other drugs and opiates. 

SPECIAL MEANING TO LATTER-DAY SAINTS 

To the members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 
the worth of the individual has special meaning. Quorums, auxiliaries, 
wards, stakes, even the Church itself, are all organized to further the 
welfare of man. All are but means to an end, and that end the happiness 
and eternal welfare of every child of God. 

With wards, quorums, organizations and auxiliaries in mind, I wish 
to suggest again three major means of winning souls to Christ. 

These three conditions are: 

1. Enrollment of every individual. 

2. Personal contact. 

3. Group service. 

These three plans or conditions are already operating in the Church, but 
unless they function they will be ineffective in acomplishing the purposes 
for which they have been established. They will be like a sugar factory 
in which the wheels are silent and rusty. 

The first duty of each of these organizations is to enroll every 
individual who belongs to it, not only enroll but know the conditions 
under which each person lives. 

The second condition is personal contact. To make this possible 
and effective there has been organized in every ward in the Church a 
Correlation Committee, made up of the heads of quorums and organiza- 
tions which combined comprehend every man, woman, and child in the 
ward. The third is service. It is not enough to know, and it isn't suffi- 
cient to visit, for no person can become fairly enthused with the prin- 
ciples and doctrines of the Gospel unless he lives them. "If ye will do 
the will, ye shall know," is a fundamental law of spiritual growth. 

There are 3,512 quorums in the Church in which are enrolled 
150,700 men and boys. There are 101,876 officers and teachers in the 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY 15 

auxiliary organizations. If each of these members of quorums and lady 
officers and teachers (212,500) were to influence for better living one 
individual and should "labor all his days * * * and bring save it be but one 
soul unto me, how great shall be his joy with him in the Kingdom of 
my Father." "And now," continues the revelation, "if your joy will be 
great with one soul that you have brought unto me. into the kingdom 
of my Father, how great will be your joy if you should bring many 
souls unto me !" 

PERSONALITY SACRED 

I appeal to all members of the Church and particularly to presidents 
of quorums and to officers of all auxiliaries to put forth a unified effort 
to make sweeter and better the lives of men. Only in such effort can 
the high ideal for which the Church was organized be realized. Let us 
prove to the world and particularly to those who are suspicious of us 
that we consider personality sacred and not a thing to be exploited for 
gain. 

DUTY OF INDIVIDUAL TO SOCIETY 

While emphasizing the worth of the individual, I wish to say that 
the individual in turn owes a duty to society. The world today perhaps 
as never before is demanding that the employer consider his employee 
not merely as a part of a machine to make money, but as a living, sensitive 
being entitled to justice and right. It is equally obligatory upon the 
employee to recognize the employer as one who has equal privileges. It 
is the duty of the citizen to take this same attitude toward the leaders 
of his government, and the duty of the churchman to recognize the 
rights of those appointed to preside. 

This is a time in which we should renew and rekindle the faith of 
our fathers. On every hand "we see social unrest ; unloving and unlovely 
men, greed, selfishness, political corruption. We see people indifferent, 
pleasure seeking, ignorant, far from following a life of service. Plans 
fail and success seems an Utopian dream. The materialistic philosophy 
of life which so largely controls our thinking today has nearly succeeded 
in convincing the world that a man's life does consist in the abundance 
of things which he possesses." 

THE ARISTOCRACY OF CHARACTER 

It is time for the world to try Christ's teachings. The Church of 
Christ is so completely organized and so constituted to' inspire its mem- 
bers that we may confidently look forward to the day when all individuals 
will have a fair chance for the joy of living, when men will be measured 
by what they are and not merely by what they possess, and when an 
aristocracy of character, will govern in organized society. 

"Then let us pray that come it may, 
As come it will for a' that, 
That man to man the world o'er 
Shall brothers be for a' that," - 



16 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Carlyle answered the old question, "What is the chief end of man ?" 
by saying: 

"To glorify God and enjoy him forever." 

And the Prophet Joseph brought to light the great truth that 
God's work and glory is "to bring to pass the immortality and eternal 
life of man." 

May the Lord continually inspire us to aid in this divine consum- 
mation. I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

The Columbia Broadcasting Company has been very good to us. 
They have given us, free of charge, a national broadcast for our choir. 
If we had to pay for it this broadcast would cost us tens of thousands of 
dollars every month, if not every week. Not only have they given us free 
for this purpose a half hour each week, but some months ago they 
requested that we increase our broadcast from a half hour to an hour. 

They have now asked permission to shut us off the air, so far as this 
meeting is concerned, fifteen minutes from now. Therefore, the last 
five or ten minutes of Brother Ballard's remarks will be heard by this 
audience only. We dislike to deprive those who are listening to the 
radio broadcast of the privilege of hearing the last part of Brother 
Ballard's remarks, but if they wish to read his remarks they can do so 
in the newspaper or in the Conference Pamphlet, as they will be published. 

We feel that we owe the Columbia Broadcasting Company this 
courtesy, otherwise a great many people as far distant as the Hawaiian 
Islands would be deprived of the opportunity of listening to the report 
of the baseball game. 

ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

It is a great joy, my brethren and sisters, to meet with you again 
in one of the great conferences of the Church, and how my heart has 
rejoiced in the spirit of this meeting. 

With Brother McKay, I rejoice in the selection of those splendid, 
devoted, faithful men who have been called into the service. Our hearts 
are made sad at the loss of such giants as Brother Talmage and Brother 
Roberts, but their works will live after them. But I am as sure that 
the Lord will raise up men to carry on this work as I am that I live. 
I have no fear about it. 

PROPHECY OF JOEL QUOTED 

One hundred and ten years ago last month, three years after the 
prophet had received his first vision in the sacred grove, while praying 
concerning the future of his work, anxious to have a forgiveness of his 
sins and to know his standing before the Lord, he received a visit from 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 17 

a prophet of this American hemisphere who announced that he was 
Moroni, who had kept the records of his fathers sacredly guarded for 
hundreds of years, and that these records were about to come forth, 
and that a new and marvelous work was about to begin. Among other 
things he quoted the second chapter of Joel, twenty-eighth to the last 
verse. The angel said that this was not yet fulfilled, but soon would 
be. I shall read a part of what Moroni quoted : 

"And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit upon all 
flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream 
dreams, your young men shall see visions : 

"And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I 
pour out my spirit. 

"And I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth." 

One hundred and ten years ago Moroni declared that the day was 
at hand when that prediction of old was about to be fulfilled. 

ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO 

As I stood in the World's Fair a few days ago, A Century of Pro- 
gress, in Chicago, witnessing the marvelous growth that has occurred in 
the hundred years that have just passed, I could not help but think of 
this prophecy of Joel. In the hall of transportation and communication 
I saw what was the condition of the world one hundred years ago, so far 
as their means of communication or travel was concerned, and it had 
made almost no progress since the days of ancient Egypt. During all 
these centuries of time men were traveling as they did one hundred years 
ago. Their means of travel was the canal boat, the ox-cart, the horse 
and wagon. Their tools were largely the shovels, the scythes, axes, and 
the flails. It took from May to November, one hundred years ago, to 
send a letter from one coast to the other, and the cost was five dollars. 
Dirt roads were the only highways. Newspapers were made on hand 
presses, and only two hundred copies an hour. 

THE EIGHTEENTH- CENTURY 

Then the eighteenth century came, the new day that the Lord de- 
clared 1 10 years ago was about to dawn, burst on the world, and what 
marvels have been wrought ! Wonders in the heavens, and wonders 
upon the earth, even as Joel declared. In 1829 came the locomotive ; in 
1832 the telegraph ; in 1833 reaping machinery ; in 1830 sewing machines ; 
in 1849 steam engines ; in 1852 elevators ; in 1856 steel. Then followed 
internal combination engines, electric generators, automobiles, airplanes, 
typewriters, motion pictures, the telephone, the radio, the electric lamp, 
and a thousand other marvelous inventions. 

In 1874 it cost two hundred and fifty dollars to move a ton of 
freight four hundred miles. In 1896 Barnum and Bailey exhibited for 
the first time in their circus a horseless carriage. Elwood Haynes was 
arrested in Chicago for driving the first automobile in that city. There 
are only twenty-five million of them traveling in the United States today. 



18 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Jane Addams said: "The decade beginning in 1830 has been des- 
cribed as the beginning day of the emancipation and hope, opening paths 
of progress in all directions." 

Bruce Barton said: "The heresy of yesterday becomes the ortho- 
doxy of today. Truth never stands still. It goes forward, sometimes 
slowly, sometimes by leaps and bounds ; at present it is flying." 

MORONI'S WORDS FULFILLED 

I bear witness to you, my brethren and sisters, that the words of 
the angel of the Lord to Joseph Smith have been fulfilled. Wonders 
have been wrought upon the earth and in the heavens. The vision of 
God has been opened to the minds of men. In the laboratory and else- 
where they have dreamed dreams. The secrets of God have been made 
known to man. It is not because this generation is smarter than those 
which have preceded it, for some of the greatest of minds that ever 
appeared in the world came before our century of time, but it was not 
the hour when these secrets were to be known. I grant you that the 
Lord has sent into the world in this day choice men who can be used 
to accomplish these marvelous things, but even their smartness would 
not have succeeded had it not been the good pleasure of God to unlock 
and open the windows of heaven and pour his Spirit out upon all flesh, 
and we have made greater progress in the last hundred years than was 
made in all the ages of time. Surely God has done it. 

As I looked upon these marvelous advancements and realized that 
I had lived to see in my own period of time greater progress than all 
of my fathers have seen in all the ages of time that they have lived 
upon the earth, I asked myself what have I done to be privileged to live 
in such a marvelous age, and to see so much, and what is my responsi- 
bility, and what is the end of the matter, for we have not yet reached 
the end ? 

MARVELOUS TRANSFORMATION IN PALESTINE 

Among the marvels that I witness in the earth in addition to these 
inventions is the hand of God at work establishing his people, even as 
he predicted in ancient times. The Lord Jesus Christ said concerning 
Jerusalem : 

"And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive 
into all nations ; and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the 
times of the Gentiles be fulfilled." 

All of that has been fulfilled, and Jerusalem has been trodden down. 
But the time of deliverance had come when General Allenby's army 
marched up to the land of Palestine and broke the band and the power 
that had ruled that land for ages. Although the Crusaders had waged 
war to redeem it, and millions of lives and property had been given 
to rescue the land, it was not the hour until this day dawned, and from 
that day on the hand of God has been over the land and its prosperity 
is manifest. 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 19 

I want to read just a few words from a recent visitor, an eminent 
gentleman who has been over the land of Palestine, and who calls atten- 
tion to the fact that a few years ago, an eminent Frenchman, Chateau- 
briand, visited the land, and called it a land of desolation, where the 
voice of God was not heard any more, where all was still and quiet, 
and the end of miracles had come. But, said this visitor, "Chateau- 
briand was wrong, for a host of miracles had happened even in the 
short interval of time since my last visit to the Holy Land." — Some two 
years before. — "Wheatfields waved me a welcome, where only marsh 
and barren sand existed on the previous trip. Jerusalem has spread 
out in brand-new Jewish suburbs. Tiberias has become a Spa. Perfume 
is borne on the breezes from the new orange groves of Sharon. Here 
and there too the hanging gardens of Solomon's day have been restored. 
Fresh earth has been dragged up the mountain slopes by Jewish labor 
battalions. Trees have been planted on the hills. New vineyards 
have been laid out over the gray, sun-beaten rocks of Samaria. Chateau- 
briand's 'desert' has grown a hundred new schoolhouses ; it has 'budded, 
bloomed blossoms, and yielded' transmission stations and farmsteads, 
a university, and a network of colonies. Surely it is a miracle more 
wondrous than the budding of Aaron's rod in the wilderness of Paran." 

PROMISES CONCERNING JEWS BEING FULFILLED 

And the Jews are turning their faces towards that land of hope 
for them. Our hearts have been full of sympathy for this race. They 
are our half-brothers. God's promises upon them are to be fulfilled. 
The inspiration that directed the Prophet Joseph to send one of the 
Apostles of the Church a hundred years ago to bless the land for the 
return of the Jews, speaks of our affection for them, and the day has 
come when there is no enmity between Ephraim and Judah, for we are of 
Ephraim and we love our brothers the Jews. If the hand of oppression 
seems still reared against them in Germany, and there seems to be no 
peace for them, we still see the hand of God even in that. For we came 
west because we had to; it was the place for us, and the Lord has 
appointed a place for them, and if they do not go willingly they will 
have to go otherwise, even as we had to do, but they will see the hand 
of God opening before them a way and an opportunity to rebuild them- 
selves and to establish a nation. 

ANOTHER GREAT PROPHECY FULFILLED 

This is one of the miracles, one of the mighty miracles of this 
modern age. And then I remember also that the prophet Isaiah declared 
concerning that other great movement that was to come in this age : 

"And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord's 
house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above 
the hills ; and all nations shall flow unto it. 

"And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us! go up to the mountain 
of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob ; and he will teach us of his ways, 
and we will walk in his paths." 



20 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

That miracle has been fulfilled — a part of this century of progress. 
For up in the tops of these mountains, not down in the valleys and 
prairies of Illinois and of Ohio, .but here, this is the place, and we came 
to fulfil the prophecies of old, to a place which God has preserved for 
this people. And here we are, made up of all nations of the earth, trying 
to work out the problems of the world and solve them by and through 
the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. 

AT THE WORLD'S FAIR IN CHICAGO 

In our booth at Chicago the elders of our Church are calling the 
attention of the thousands who pause there to the wonderful 
Gospel message. That to me is a miracle. Forty years ago, when 
we sent Brother Brigham H. Roberts to speak for the Church before 
the Parliament of Religions, he did not get a hearing except in a com- 
mittee room. But today it is different, we stand with equal opportunity 
to every other Church in the land, with a display that is in many respects 
far more interesting, and more people pause to listen to our story. 
Mormonism is solving the problems of the day, and I thought as I 
witnessed these things, how God is moving. 

MAKING HISTORY 

We are to be a light unto the world and solve the problems of men, 
and as I listened to the appeal of our President I felt that we were making 
history today. We have been making history during these years, and 
we are going to make some more history in the next month or so, that 
we are either going to be proud or ashamed of, when we come to express 
ourselves on the Eighteenth Amendment. 

IF WE ARE DIFFERENT 

I heard the missionaries in Canada, where I visited recently saying, 
"O, how we are praying that Utah will be different! Then we may go 
from door to door with our heads up and with a new spirit in our hearts, 
with new courage to appeal to the best people." For let me say to you 
that many of the best people in this land are standing for the maintenance 
of the Eighteenth Amendment. I find that in the churches all over 
the land noble souls are fighting for these high ideals, and our appeal 
to them will be greater than it has ever been before, if we are different. 
And ought we to be different? The day will come when the ends of 
the earth will say, "Come let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to 
the house of the God of Jacob." It will be to learn of our ways, and if our 
ways are like the ways of the world, why will they come? If we are 
different they will come. We are called to be pattern-makers, to hold 
aloft the colors, and to show the way to others who cannot see as clearly 
as we can. 

Thank the Lord for our glorious principles. Our fathers were 
true to them in the day of their trials, they showed their stamina and 
their worth. If there is enough of the iron that was in them in us 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 21 

we too will stand, though we stand alone, for ideals, for standards, for 
the accomplishment of great things. God expects it of the Latter-day 
Saints. 

IN PREPARATION FOR CHRIST'S COMING 

Now what is to be the end of all this progress, brethren and sisters? 
I declare to you it is preparing this world for the coming of the Son 
of God. He would not come to a world that was in the condition this 
world was in a hundred years ago. All these marvelous changes had 
to come. Yes, and many changes will yet come, for there are many 
things that will have to take place before the Son of Man shall come. 
But this world was never more willing to receive him than they are 
today, because the whole world would like a dictator, somebody to tell 
them what to do, someone in whom they have confidence. But they 
will want him worse than they want him today before he comes. 
There are battles to be fought, yes, and struggles and conflict, war and 
bloodshed, and famine 'and pestilence. And nations will be wrecked, 
and thrones will fall, but out of all of these conflicts will come the 
victory for truth and righteousness. All things will go forward to 
prepare this world for its golden age, and its golden age will come, and 
universal brotherhood will come, and peace will come to men. 

DELIVERANCE PROMISED 

God bless the Latter-day Saints through these trials, that we may 
be true, that we may not show the white feather, that we shall be patient 
under trials and be true to God. For I promise you that you will see 
the work of God go forward. Its new day has come, and God has a 
great program for this Church. If the Latter-day Saints will keep 
their covenants, if they will pay their tithes and their offerings, and 
keep themselves clean and undefiled from the sins of the world, I 
promise them, in the name of the Lord, deliverance from all their 
difficulties, and they shall see the sun arise with healing in its wings for 
all who have been wounded and hurt. 

God help us to be faithful and true, I pray in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I hardly think it would be fair to the next speaker to give him 
ten minutes at a time when the people cannot hear him over the radio, 
so I am going to read a revelation that was given to the Patriarch Hyrum 
Smith. The revelation says that it is for all of us. This also was given 
eleven months before the Church was organized : I am going to read all 
of Section 11 : 

"A great and marvelous work is about to come forth among the children of 
men. 

"Behold, I am God; give heed to my word, which is quick and powerful, 
sharper than a two-edged sword, to the dividing asunder of both joints and 
marrow; therefore give heed unto my word. 



22 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

"Behold, the field is white already to harvest; therefore, whoso desireth to 
reap let him thrust in his' sickle with his might, and reap while the day lasts, that 
he may treasure up for his soul everlasting salvation in the kingdom of God. 

"Yea, whosoever will thrust in his sickle and reap, the same is called of God. 

"Therefore, if you will ask of me you shall receive ; if you will knock it shall 
be opened unto you. 

"Now, as you have asked, behold, I say unto you, keep my commandments" — 

I hear a great many people say : "I get sick and tired of the same 
thing over and over and over again. I am so sick of the Word of 
Wisdom I do not know what to do." If everybody who says that would 
get up on top of a house and shout : "I do not keep the Word of Wisdom," 
he could not give himself away any more perfectly. 

" and seek to bring forth and establish the cause of Zion." 

And remember, the Church was not yet organized. 

"Seek not for riches." 

ETERNAL RICHES 

Wouldn't it be fine if we did not do that? 

"Seek not for riches but for wisdom ; and, behold, the mysteries of God shall 
be unfolded unto you, and then shall you be made rich. Behold, he that hath 
eternal life is rich. 

"Verily, verily, I say unto you, even as you desire of me so it shall be done 
unto you; and, if you desire, you shall be the means of doing much good in this 
generation." 

A MARVELOUS POSTERITY 

Not only did Hyrum Smith do much good, but what a marvelous 
posterity he has left in one man alone — Joseph Fielding Smith, former 
President of the Church. 

"Say nothing but repentance unto this generation." 

Once more : 

"Keep my commandments, and assist to bring forth my work, according to 
my commandments, and you shall be blessed. 

"Behold, thou hast a gift, or thou shalt have a gift if thou wilt desire of me 
in faith, with an honest heart, believing in the power of Jesus Christ, or in my 
power which speaketh unto thee;" 

How we should rejoice to have Jesus Christ speak unto us! And 
he has done so in this revelation. 

"For behold, it is I that speak; behold, I am the light which shineth in the 
darkness, and by my power I give these words unto thee. 

"And now, verijy, verily, I say unto thee, put your trust in that Spirit which 
leadeth to do good — yea, to do justly, to walk humbly, to judge righteously; and 
this is my Spirit. 

"Verily, verily, I say unto you, I will impart unto you of my Spirit, which 
shall enlighten your mind, which shall fill your soul with joy; 

"And then shall ye know, or by this shall you know, all things whatsoever 
you desire of me, which are pertaining unto things of righteousness, in faith 
believing in me that you shall receive. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 23 

"Behold, I command you that you need not suppose that you are called to 
preach until you are called. 

"Wait a little longer, until you shall have my word, my rock, my church, and 
my gospel, that you may know of a surety my doctrine. 

"And then, behold, according to your desires, yea, even according to your 
faith shall it be done unto you. 

"Keep my commandments;" 

REPETITION JUSTIFIED 

Once more. You know some people complain about our repeating 
ourselves. Indeed, the Savior is guilty of repeating himself. 

"hold your peace; appeal unto my spirit; 

"Yea, cleave unto me with all your heart, that you may assist in bringing 
to light those things of which has been spoken — yea, the translation of my work;" 

Remember, they were translating the Book of Mormon at that time. 

"be patient until you shall accomplish it. 

"Behold, this is your work, to keep my commandments, yea, with all your 
might, mind and strength. 

"Seek not to declare my word, but first seek to obtain my word, and then 
shall your tongue be loosed ; then, if you desire, you shall have my Spirit and my 
word, yea, the power of God unto the convincing of men. 

"But now hold your peace ; study my word which hath gone forth among 
the children of men, and also study my word which shall come forth among the 
children of men, or that which is now translating, yea, until you have obtained 
all which I shall grant unto the children of men in this generation, and then shall 
all things be added thereto. 

"Behold, thou art Hyrum, my son; seek the kingdom of God, and all things 
shall be added according to that which is just. 

"Build upon my rock, which is my gospel ; 

"Deny not the spirit of revelation, nor the spirit of prophecy, for wo unto 
him that denieth these things ; 

"Therefore, treasure up in your heart until the time which is in my wisdom 
that you shall go forth. 

"Behold, I speak unto all who have good desires, and have thrust in their 
sickle to reap." 

Please remember that the main reason why I was impressed to 
read this revelation was because of these few words : 

"Behold, I speak unto all who have good desires, and have thrust in their 
sickle to reap. 

"Behold, I am Jesus 1 Christ, the Son of God. I am the life and the light of 
the world. 

"I am the same who came unto mine own and mine own received me not; 

"But verily, verily, I say unto you, that as many as 1 receive me, to them will I 
give power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on my name. 
Amen." 

The congregation sang the hymn, "Zion stands with hills sur- 
rounded." 

Elder Mark Austin offered the benediction. 
Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock p. m. 



24 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

FIRST DAY 
AFTERNOON MEETING 

The second session of the Conference commenced at 2 o'clock. 

President Heber J. Grant announced that The Singing Mothers 
would furnish the music for this meeting, and that they, together with 
the congregation, would sing as an opening number, "Redeemer of 
Israel." 

After the singing of this hymn the opening prayer was offered 
by Elder W. Aird Macdonald, President of the San Francisco Stake. 

The Singing Mothers sang the hymn, "An Angel from on High," 
duet part by Sisters Virginia Freeze Barker and Annette Richardson 
Dinwoodey. 

ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

I am sure that all of you who were here this morning rejoiced in 
the blessings that came to us, and I trust that during the time we are 
together this afternoon that same sweet spirit may characterize what 
may be said and done. 

I have felt the absence of two of the brethren who were here at our 
last general conference, and I marvel how quickly we move on, and how 
soon those who have served us pass from our remembrance. In a few 
short years others occupy the posts of duty, and this Church that was 
organized in the year 1830 goes forward year by year. 

REJOICES IN GROWTH OF CHURCH 

"We believe in God, the Eternal Father, and in his Son, Jesus 
Christ, and in the Holy Ghost." I am grateful that when the Gospel 
came in this latter day there were so many who were willing to cast 
in their lot with that unpopular group. When we think that it is only 
a little over a hundred years since this Church was organized, and that 
notwithstanding the opposition of evil throughout the world, it has 
continued to grow until today it is stronger and more potent for blessing 
mankind than it has ever been, we have cause for rejoicing. 

It is my privilege to travel much in the world. Many of my 
associates are men of other faiths or men who have no faith, and I 
rejoice in observing how tolerant and how considerate many of these 
people are when I realize that only a few years ago it was almost im- 
possible for us to obtain a hearing in the larger centers of the world. 

THE LORD'S WORK 

But this is the Lord's work. It was his beloved Son who came 
and directed the organization of this Church. That was not done 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 25 

because there were not other churches; it was not necessary be- 
cause there were not people worshiping God; but it was necessary 
in order that the scriptures might be fulfilled and in order that the 
Church of Jesus Christ might be again established. When I say that, 
it is not with any unkindness toward any other faith or creed. I realize 
that each of us must live his or her individual life, and when we think 
of the wonderful people there are throughout the world who do not 
know about the Gospel of Jesus Christ, who have no conceptions of 
the teachings of our Lord as revealed again in this latter day, and as we 
see so many of them that are anxious to know what to do, I realize 
how important and serious our problem is. 

You brethren who are sitting here today have had conferred upon 
you a sacred opportunity, a sacred trust. You have received the bless- 
ings of the holy Priesthood. Divine authority has been conferred upon 
you, and with that authority there has come the responsibility of raising 
your voice and living your life so that the people of the world may 
know the difference between the Gospel of Jesus Christ and other 
organizations of the world. 

ALL HAVE EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR EXALTATION 

I find as I travel about that people are astonished when they dis- 
cover that men of this Church who attain prominence, men who have 
been exalted in political and business life, retain their faith. I had 
a man ask me sometime ago : "How is it that people can remain faithful 
in your Church and still have all of these advantages that come in the 
world?" He said: "In our church this is not the case. When men 
become prominent in civil life or in business life in most cases we lose 
their cooperation." 

I thought today as I sat here looking at this group of men and 
women who have had unusual opportunities for education, refinement, 
and culture, opportunities to serve in various capacities, that when 
we meet as we have met today we are brethren and sisters, we have the 
spirit of the Gospel, we have affection for one another, and we meet 
under that influence that our Heavenly Father said should exist if we 
love our neighbors as ourselves. 

One of the beautiful things to me in the Gospel of Jesus Christ 
is that it brings us all to a common level. It is not necessary for a man 
to be a president of a stake, or a member of the Quorum of the Twelve, 
in order to attain a high place in the celestial kingdom. The humblest 
member of the Church, if he keeps the commandments of God, will 
obtain an exaltation just as much as any other man in the celestial king- 
dom. The beauty of the Gospel of Jesus Christ is that it makes us all 
equal in as far as we keep the commandments of the Lord. In as far as 
we observe to keep the laws of the Church we have equal opportunities 
for exaltation. As we develop faith and righteousness our light is 
made to shine as a guide and blessing to those with whom we mingle. 



26 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

SHOULD PRAY FOR NATION^ LEADERS 

Today the world is confused. There never has been a time within 
my memory when there was so much uncertainty as to what we should 
do. Reference has been made to the President of the United States, 
that he is the leader of this nation ; and I am sure that as members of 
this Church we ought to pray for the President of the United States. 
We ought to ask the Lord to inspire and bless him. iWe ought to pray 
for those who associate with him. We ought to be what the Lord 
would have us be — real helpers in a great nation such as the one in which 
we live. 

RULES GOVERNING MEMBERSHIP IN CHRIST'S CHURCH 

Our Heavenly Father has revealed to us what his purposes are to- 
ward the children of men. We are expected to have faith, we are 
expected to repent of our sins, we are expected to receive baptism of 
the water and of the Holy Ghost. The Lord himself has prescribed the 
rules that govern membership in this his Church. And when I say 
his Church, it is not with any discriminating feeling against any other 
church, because I realize that when all the good men and women in all 
the church organizations of the world — and there are millions of them — 
when they live up to all the light that they now possess, and have added 
to that the light and information that God has revealed in this latter 
day, they too will be glad to cast in their lot with us — not because we 
are better men or better women than they, but because they will desire 
to walk in the footsteps of the Master and desire to walk according 
to the pattern he has given us, and follow the admonition he has given 
the children of men. 

CHANGE IN ATTITUDE TOWARD RELIGION 

I rejoice in my companionship with men and women in the world 
as I go to and fro — I meet many marvelous characters — and I am 
happy to observe in the last few years quite a change in their attitude 
toward religion. Some of them seem to have been non-religious in many 
respects, but the conditions in the last few years have changed their 
attitude and today they are glad to sit down and converse about the 
principles of the Gospel and learn what it is that the Latter-day Saints 
seem to have that they do not possess. I feel it is only a question of 
time, if we do our part, until most of our Father's children who are 
in the world and do not now understand, will learn of the truth and will 
be glad to be identified with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints. 

THE CHURCH ALL-COMPREHENSIVE 

In order to do that they will not have to give up any good thing 
they have learned in the Methodist Church, they will not have to 
surrender anything that is good that they have learned in the Catholic 
Church, they will not have to give away or lose sight of any blessing 
that has come to them from any quarter in order to belong to the 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 27 

Church of Jesus Christ. That is the beauty of this work. To me it is 
all-comprehensive; when it comes to that which is good there is not a 
virtue, there is not a desirable attribute that a human being may attain 
to that he is not able to enjoy to its fullest extent as a member of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 

MUST LEAVEN THE LUMP 

And so today, while we assemble here comparatively a little handful 
of our Father's children among the great multitude of the world, yet we 
are the leaven that must leaven the whole lump, and unless we keep the 
commandments of God we will not succeed. If the salt should lose its 
savor, how shall the great multitude of this earth be salted? It is your 
privilege, my brethren and sisters, to know these things, and it is our 
privilege as members of the Church to do our full part as the Lord 
requires at our hands. 

SERVICE IN THE MISSION FIELD 

There never has been a time for years when there were so few 
missionaries in the world as there are today, and the world has never 
needed missionaries more than today. There are men in this audience, 
and they have relatives and friends and members of their families who 
could support them, who want to be in the mission field. You would be 
happier, you would be accomplishing something that would be eternal, 
you would not be wasting your time seeking for the things that perish 
if you were serving in the mission field. 

Only a few years ago many of my friends were well-to-do, they had 
the necessities of life, and many of the luxuries, and when it was 
intimated that they might go into the mission field some of them would 
say : "I can not leave my business, I can not get along if I go off and 
leave what I have." But their business has gone off and left them. 
The things that they thought they could not get along without have 
disappeared from their control, and many of these very men today would 
be happy if they could go back ten years, and if they were then called to 
go into the service of the Lord, they could say: "I will adjust my affairs, 
I am happy at the opportunity that is offered me to be a minister of life 
and salvation." 

Our ministry is so different in the world. Think of our oppor- 
tunities and privileges, to be able to sit down in the homes of the 
honorable men of the world and teach them the Gospel of Jesus Christ ; 
think what it might mean to sit down with men who do not possess 
divine authority, and teach them the plan of salvation and explain to 
them the manner by which they too may enjoy the blessings of divine 
authority which you enjoy. 

OUR DUTY TO OTHERS 

I feel that some of us are selfish. We are so glad to enjoy our 
blessings, we are so happy to be surrounded by the comforts of life and 



28 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

to ha,ve the association of the best men and women that can be found 
in the world, that we forget our duty to others. How happy we could 
be if we would strive to be more potent for good in the world by minister- 
ing to those who have not yet understood the Gospel of our Lord. 

Many of us have passed middle life, many of us are completing 
our work. The Church needs missionaries in the field. Men who 
understand the Gospel and who are willing to give their lives for it if 
need be, and when I say we need missionaries I mean that the world 
needs them. 

There never has been a time when there was a better opportunity 
for disseminating the truth than now. Never a time when so many 
homes would make us welcome. Never a time when we could lay up 
treasures in heaven where moth and rust will not corrupt or thieves 
break through and steal, better than in the year 1933. Do not let us 
forget that. 

A GREAT BLESSING 

I feel that our financial difficulties will prove a great blessing 
to many of us. We will become more humble, we will draw nearer to 
our Heavenly Father, we will be more willing to be guided by his 
influence, we will not feel self-sufficient as some of us have, and in our 
homes we will know the necessity of uniting at the altar of prayer 
and invoking the blessing of the Lord upon us. By repenting of our 
foolishness and reforming our lives we will evidence our desire to be 
real Latter-day Saints — real sons and daughters of the living God. 

OUR OPPORTUNITIES 

These are our opportunities, and they will pass from many of us 
in the not distant future. Some of us will finish our work soon. We 
do not know when but while the day lasts, while there is yet time, 
let us set our houses in order and renew our determination to be worthy 
of a heritage in the celestial kingdom. It is not always the amount of 
earthly wealth that we acquire that blesses us, but it is the spiritual 
wealth that is a real benefit to us year after year ; and eternally if we 
would be happy. We ought to radiate sunshine and make others who 
are less fortunate than ourselves as happy as possible. 

OUR DUTY TO SERVE 

The Presidency of the Church are burdened with tremendous 
responsibility. I marvel, sometimes, how they go forward day after 
day and year after year, carrying their load. Let us relieve them as 
much as possible by properly caring for our departments. I realize 
that I am talking to the leadership of the Church today. I know that 
the majority of the rank and file are not here. A few of them may 
be listening in. We and they are all children of the same kind Father 
who loves every one of us, and he will bless us in proportion to the 
manner in which we serve, not ourselves, but serve our fellows. 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 29 

We have from time to time conferences with auxiliary organiza- 
tions, we have our great Priesthood conventions, our annual conferences, 
our quarterly conferences. The Lord has provided every opportunity 
for us at home to learn what he would have us do. If any of us fail to 
understand, it will not be his fault. 

Consider the welfare of our brethren and sisters in the world. What 
of those who are now among the nations of the earth? It has already 
been intimated by the President of the Church that the gleaning time 
has come, and that those of us who are willing to go out and help in 
the gleaning will be those who will receive the blessing. 

Great and good men in the world are looking to us. Only today 
a brother from California said to me that he had been talking with a 
very prominent man in another church who has been watching the 
elections in the United States of America, the elections that are being 
held in the various states. He said to our brother : "If Utah holds her 
place as she has a' right to hold it, if Utah remains true to the ideals 
for which she has been standing all these years, it will not be a difficult 
thing for me to join you, because I know there is something worthwhile 
there." 

So, brethren and sisters, let us not lose our opportunities, let us not 
sell our birthright for a "mess of pottage." Let us say to the Lord, 
"We are willing to serve, we are willing to live, we are anxious to be 
exemplars for thy sons and daughters elsewhere," not that we may be 
puffed-up in our own conceit, but in order that good men and good 
women in all the world, whose eyes are now upon Zion as they have 
never been before, may not be disappointed in us, and that we may 
glorify the name of our Heavenly Father, that we may magnify his 
Church, that we may exemplify in our lives the teachings we have 
had from the beginning, and be worthy to be called his sons and daughters 
in very deed. 

I pray that we who are here today and that those with whom we 
may come in contact in the not distant future may feel the influence 
that the Lord is willing to bestow upon us when we serve him and 
keep his commandments. 

GRATEFUL FOR BLESSINGS 

I am grateful for my position among the General Authorities of 
the Church, one of the humblest of all. I am grateful for their com- 
panionship. I know that these men are servants of the Lord, and I know 
they are seeking to bless mankind. I hope that not any of you who are 
here will fail to sustain them, not only by your faith and prayers but if 
they are misrepresented and their attitude misinterpreted, that you may 
be willing and anxious to defend them, if need be, because there is a 
time coming when they will need your defense. The Adversary has not 
forgotten them, and one of the evidences to me of the divinity of the 
calling of these men is that evil men speak evil of them, and good men 
and good women speak well of them. 



30 GENERAL CONFERENCE 



TESTIMONY 



I know that this is the work of the Lord, I know that this is the 
Church of his beloved Son, restored to the earth for the last time. I 
realize how serious the obligation is that rests upon us, and in bearing 
my testimony to you today, I do so with the feeling and desire that you 
may know as I know that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, that Joseph 
Smith was a Prophet of the living Lord. This organization effected in 
1830 is for the salvation of the human family. It is the work that God 
intended the world to be benefited and blessed by. He has offered us 
the privilege of carrying that blessing to others, and that we may do our 
duty I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JOHN H. TAYLOR 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

I feel very appreciative, my brethren and sisters, of the blessing 
that has come to me, but knowing myself as I do, I feel incapable and 
unworthy of this blessing. 

I have a testimony of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. From my youth 
up I have been taught concerning the Gospel, and while I didn't under- 
stand the full import of the Gospel message when I was young, because 
of the teachings of my father and mother I was able to hold to the 
Church and gradually find out for myself about the divine work in which 
we are engaged at the present time. 

May I say this, too: I am very grateful to my Heavenly Father 
that he gave me such a good mother and such a good wife. Sometimes 
I think that we men think that we have accomplished great things because 
of ourselves, but I can bear testimony that the good things that I may 
have in my life, and the good things that I may have done, have been 
helped and encouraged by my mother and by my wife. Surely we are 
all grateful when we are thus blessed and helped in our work. 

My father has been dead for a number of years, and President 
Grant has been a father to me. He has been concerned in my life and 
my doings and has made it possible for me to do many things that perhaps 
I would not have been able to do had it not been for his encouragement 
and blessing. I am grateful to these men and women who have helped 
me. 

I have been very fortunate in my associations in a church way, 
because since my youth I have known the presidents of the Church, the 
apostles, and the other leaders of the Church ; and they have at all times 
been an inspiration and a blessing to me. The work I have been called 
to do in recent years, first as the field man for the Mutual Improvement 
Associations, then in the mission field, and later in the Missionary 
Home, has brought to me happiness and contentment of life, and a 
desire to be of service to God. I can think of nothing finer or better 
than to come in contact with the lives of young people, and to be a part 



ELDER JOHN H. TAYLOR 31 

of their life in finding out God and gaining a testimony of the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ. 

I love these my brethren and you, my brethren and sisters. I trust 
that God will bless me, that I may so act that I may have your confidence, 
your love and your blessing, that in my weakness I may be able to do 
some good in this the church of God. I pray for these blessings in 
Jesus' name. Amen. 

ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 

Presiding Bishop of the Church 

I am happy, my brethren and sisters and friends, to be with you 
in this splendid conference, to enjoy the spirit of this gathering. 

I was greatly impressed this morning, in the opening remarks of 
President Grant, with the variety of important quotations which he 
read from the Doctrine and Covenants, which refer to and present the 
means of solving many of the social, economic and moral problems 
which confront the world today. Those few excerpts which he presented, 
of themselves form a strong evidence of the divinity of that scripture. 
I would like to speak to you for a few minutes this afternoon along 
some lines that President Grant referred to in those remarks. 

president roosevelt's address 

I was reading just recently an address delivered by President 
Roosevelt, with regard to t"he conditions which are prevailing today in 
a social way in this country. Among other things President Roosevelt 
said : "Social justice is becoming an ever-growing factor and influence 
in almost every part of the world." Again he said : "Humanity is moving 
forward to the practical application of the teachings of Christianity, 
as they affect the individual lives of men and women." Then further : 
"No program of recovery can suddenly restore all our people to self- 
support. * * * The longer, harder part still lies ahead. We must re- 
double our efforts to care for those who still need relief, to prevent dis- 
integration of home life, and to stand by the victims of depression until 
it is definitely past." Again: "The federal government cannot do the 
whole job. Every community and every state must do their share." 

extensive church relief 

I am sure we agree to these statements made by the President of 
the United States, and that the Church to which we belong is doing its 
part in conformity with these suggestions. I think I may state, without 
question of doubt or contradiction, that this Church has done more and 
\s doing more, in proportion, for the relief of those in need, than any 
other religious organization. I do not think I shall be challenged in 
that statement. In the past I believe the Church has done proportionately 
more than could reasonably be expected of it. 



32 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

SOCIAL JUSTICE 

The desire of the authorities of this Church is for the welfare of its 
members. As has been frequently remarked, the effort is to help men 
and women to help themselves. The business of the Church is to pro- 
mote, in the largest way, social justice for its members and for all man- 
kind. Every worker is entitled to the opportunity for reasonable em- 
ployment at fair compensation, for leisure time for recreation and 
study, and for spiritual development. Every wife and mother is en- 
titled to proper consideration in the care of her household and to similar 
opportunities for recreation, intellectual and spiritual progress. Every 
child is likewise entitled to opportunities for reasonable education, for 
recreation and preparation for life, and to protection from unfair prac- 
tices. In like manner, each of them has the obligation to society at large 
to do his or her part in promoting better conditions generally that will 
make for progress and peace. Under the present disturbed circumstances 
these conditions are not being fully realized. But it is even more import- 
ant for us all to cooperate in striving to bring such conditions about. 
The teachings of the Gospel are the very essence of social justice. To 
the extent that we observe them we shall evidence fair dealing, mutual 
helpfulness and kindness to all. 

COMPARATIVE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS 

I think the economic conditions throughout the Church are prob- 
ably not so serious as they are in other parts of the country. In the 
first place, we are generally living in less congested areas than the 
industrial sections of the country. We are, in considerable part, an 
agricultural people. That is, we live nearer to the soil, I think, in pro- 
portion, than most other communities. There is probably greater equality 
and, consequently, less extreme poverty and less great riches, among the 
people of this Church, than other communities, whether religious or 
social organizations. So our problems may not be quite so serious 
Yet they are so serious as to deserve the earnest consideration and effort 
of every one who has responsibility in this Church, and also of every 
member. Because this Church is working as a unit to promote the 
welfare of all of the people. 

CHURCH SOCIAL STANDARDS 

Our standards, as established by the Gospel, not only as given by 
the Savior and his apostles in earlier days, and as taught by the prophets 
in Israel, but through the revelations of the Lord in these days, are 
broader and more important and more definitely placed before us than 
any people have ever had. We have the standards set up for us to 
follow, socially, morally and religiously. If we will endeavor to observe 
those standards — in other words, if we will learn, as has been expressed 
here frequently today, to keep the commandments of the Lord — we shall 
grow in right living, social justice and true charity. It leads, in fact, 
to the finest civilization. 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 33 

CHRISTIAN QUALITIES 

In one of the quotations from the revelations of the Lord, as con- 
tained in the Doctrine and Covenants, President Grant called attention 
to the qualities necessary for Gospel service among men. The in- 
structions apply to us and to all mankind, if we would promote the 
greatest human welfare. These qualities are: faith, virtue, knowledge, 
temperance, patience, brotherly kindness, godliness, charity, humility 
and diligence. The development of these qualities in the lives of men 
and women comes as a result of Gospel teaching and enables them to 
apply the same practically for the welfare of humanity as referred to 
by President Roosevelt. 

If we would apply in our lives the teachings of the Savior, day by 
day, as they have been taught to us through revelations from him in these 
days, our lives would be most exemplary and influential among mankind. 

I believe the Latter-day Saints, as a whole, are endeavoring to live 
in accordance with these teachings — to practically apply them, as Presi- 
dent Roosevelt says, as they individually affect us — so that we may 
evidence greater helpfulness, equity and consideration for one another. 
That, I think, is the most effective sign of the spirit of the Gospel for 
which we are all striving. I am sure that if we keep constantly before 
us the practical application of the Golden Rule, that whatsoever we 
would that men should do unto us, we would do it unto them, thinking 
beforehand what we would like to have done to us, and then applying 
that in our relations with our fellow men, we shall increase in our power 
to do good and to advance human welfare. 

NATIONAL RECOVERY 

I believe we all appreciate the fact that the President of the United 
States and his administration are endeavoring in every possible way 
to promote general recovery from the depressed conditions we have 
suffered. As has been stated, it cannot be immediate. It will require 
time to bring to pass the things that are desirable, and to overcome the 
economic stagnation through which we have been struggling for the last 
three or four years. To rise on the crest of the wave which we are 
hoping and striving for, out of the trough in which we have been for 
some time, exacts powerful, coordinated efforts. Progress must 
necessarily be gradual and sound. The efforts of the administration 
to coordinate public works, industrial recovery plans, means of raising 
farm commodity and other prices gradually, in ord<;r to increase em- 
ployment and consequent purchasing power, cannot all be effected 
hastily. The plan conceived and the application of the same are tre- 
mendous and never previously undertaken. There have been, of course, 
delays that have interfered with the program, and have hindered, to 
some extent, the upward advance which is so greatly needed. I think 
it is our business to do our part, and to help to coordinate, as far as we 
can, the carrying out of the plan, so that the unemployed of the nation 
shall be able to obtain work to maintain themselves and their families, 



34 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

and not to have to be dependent upon public or private charity or upon 
federal relief. But, in the meantime, those in need must be taken 
care of. Therefore, pending complete recovery, there is bound to be 
suffering and distress, which the people of this nation, individually and 
collectively, must help to avoid and overcome. 

COORDINATION OF ALL RELIEF AGENCIES 

It is of the utmost importance that there should be even greater 
efficiency in the coordination of relief by all agencies engaged in caring 
for all those who are in need, including federal, state, county and private 
agencies. Care must be exercised in the system followed to be sure that 
no one in need shall suffer, and, on the other hand, that any who do not 
need help shall not impose upon those who are furnishing relief. 

SELF-SEEKERS NOT IN NEED 

I was impressed with what President Grant said with regard to 
those seeking help who do not need it. It seems to be a peculiar feeling 
or attitude, on the part of many citizens of this nation, that whenever the 
government has anything to give away, they are desirous of obtaining 
it, even though they may not actually need it, and are able to support 
themselves without. That seems to me a rather selfish attitude. I think 
that we ought to strive to be self-supporting, and, as far as possible, 
independent of help from other sources. 

FAIR CONSIDERATION FOR UNEMPLOYED 

Where help is needed, those who have the direction of relief should 
undertake to see that help is extended. There should be fair considera- 
tion given to every unemployed head of family, and to every single 
person. In all of these measures of relief that are being undertaken, 
there should be no desire to humiliate any individual who seeks em- 
ployment. There should be no effort to force them to use up all their 
resources ; in other words, to make paupers of them, when they are in 
need of employment to provide for themselves and their families. In 
my judgment, those engaged in relief work should, in their investigations, 
differentiate those requiring somewhat permanent relief from those 
who are somewhat temporarily in need of help. Certainly the latter, who 
desire employment, should not be required to sacrifice all they have 
before they receive make-work or other relief. There is danger in some 
of the relief work that is being done, that sometimes there has been 
extreme effort made to require them to go to the very limit to dispose 
of every single thing that they have, before they can obtain help from 
those who have the relief in hand. 

ALL ABLE-BODIED TO WORK FOR RELIEF 

Now, those who are out of employment are not entirely responsible 
for the conditions. They are desirous of obtaining ways and means 
whereby they can support themselves and their families. They should 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q, CANNON 35 

be encouraged in that effort, without causing them embarrassment. I 
believe that every able-bodied person who needs help should give labor 
or service for the relief that is extended. The doing of work in con- 
sideration for compensation, whether it be food relief or cash, promotes 
independence of spirit, self-respect and satisfaction. Any other policy 
is destructive of good citizenship. All should feel willing to give that 
effort. As far as possible, no help should be extended without it. 

AIM OF PUBLIC WORKS 

There are many desirable things that can be done in the various 
communities which, with reasonable planning, can be of great benefit 
to the communities. That is one of the great things that is being 
undertaken in connection with public works. The projects must be 
economically and socially desirable. They are intended to help overcome 
unemployment and reduce relief. They are planned to prove a stimulus^ 
also, to private industry throughout this whole nation. I want to express 
appreciation for the great thought on the part of the Federal administra- 
tion in trying, by the advancing of federal funds, under reasonable 
conditions, to provide the widest possible employment in the various 
sections in proportion to the needs, and thereby to provide the public 
improvements, both self-liquidating and otherwise, that will make for 
the greatest welfare of the people. In this connection may I say that in 
my judgment there needs to be the greatest mutual consideration in 
the relations between employers and employes. With the codes being 
established in industry and the rates of wages on public works, employes 
will receive higher hourly wages but less hours per week than f ormerly. 
If industry is to increase and purchasing power be strengthened, tne 
demands of labor must be reasonable and at the same time the employer 
must be considerate and fair. 

CHURCH RELIEF POLICY NOT CHANGED 

I believe- you appreciate the fact that the church policy with regard 
to relief is being carried out as it has been. In other words, the Church 
does not accept responsibility entirely for the relief of those who are in 
need. The Church realizes that, first of all, the relatives of those in 
need should extend all the help that they can possibly do, and next to 
that the counties in the various states are responsible for the care of 
those in need. The Church stands by to aid, and to see that members 
of the Church shall not suffer. We cannot, of course, go beyond that. 
Especially does the Church feel the responsibility for the faithful, 
devoted members who may be in need. We are endeavoring to cooperate 
with the various relief agencies in the most effective way toward pro- 
moting improved conditions. 

GOVERINMENT RESPONSIBILITY IN UNEMPLOYMENT 

In the stagnated conditions of private industry, it appears that 
new employment must be largely undertaken by the cities, counties, 



36 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

states and the Federal government until increased buying power develops 
through the policies being carried out by the administration. Though 
the Church is not directly responsible for providing employment, it is 
endeavoring as far as practicable to furnish additional work through 
the wards and stakes and in a general way. 

CHUCH RESPONSIBILITY AND DESTINY 

I wish to direct your attention to the responsibility of the Church 
in the fulfilment of its destiny. The matter of aiding in relief is only 
one phase of its responsibility. Under normal economic conditions 
the care of those in need should not be a major part of its responsibilities. 
With improved prices, employment and general business conditions, the 
members of the Church, in common with the rest of the people of this 
nation, can through industry, patience and thrift gradually overcome 
the unfavorable conditions in which we find ourselves. The primary 
responsibility of the Church is the preaching of the Gospel throughout 
the world for the spiritual and temporal welfare of mankind. Also, the 
great work of salvation for the dead through vicarious ordinances, and 
for the living through the divine ordinances connected therewith, forms 
an important duty. Likewise, the education in religious as well as secular 
subjects, is vital to the proper development of all Church members. In 
addition, the providing of all necessary facilities for religious worship 
and training, as well as recreational and social activities, becomes an 
essential requirement. The result of all this effort, in connection with 
other positive forces at work in the world to promote liberty, truth 
and righteousness, will be general peace, good will and spiritual progress. 

INITIATIVE AND RESOURCEFULNESS 

President Grant called our attention this morning to the divine 
counsel given us in the 58th Section of the Doctrine and Covenants — 
"It is not meet that I should command in all things, for he that is com- 
pelled in all things, the same is a slothful and not a wise servant ; where- 
fore, he receiveth no reward. Verily, I say, men should be anxiously 
engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, 
and bring to pass much righteousness ; for the power is in them, wherein 
they are agents unto themselves. And inasmuch as men do good they 
shall in nowise lose their reward." This is, in effect, what we call 
initiative. It is the doing of that which we ought to do, instead of 
having to be told. This instruction is given us primarily with respect 
to spiritual affairs. The same principle applies in our secular af- 
fairs. It is the business of everyone of us as individual Church 
members to plan our efforts and our lives in such a way as to promote the 
interests of the Gospel in the most extensive way. It is, likewise, our 
opportunity in our daily affairs to advance our personal interests in 
getting forward and in properly caring for those dependent upon us. 
This involves also the development of resourcefulness — the ability neces- 
sary to meet unusual demands or needs. Centuries ago a wise man 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 37 

declared, "Seest thou a man diligent in his business? He shall stand 
before kings, he shall not stand before mean men." 

INDUSTRY AND SELF-HELP 

It should be the attitude of all who join the Church and those who 
grow up in it to strive continually to give in every way possible for its 
advancement, rather than to seek for support from the Church. Very 
definite instructions have been revealed to us regarding the importance of 
industry and the seriousness of slothfulness and idleness. There are, 
of course, times and conditions that may require for some Church 
members some assistance beyond their own efforts. But, generally, it 
is expected that each individual will develop the spirit and determination, 
not only to maintain himself, but also to give service and financial 
help for the advancement of God's work. Therein lies progress and 
blessing. On the other hand, condemnation rests upon those who are 
covetous, greedy or idle, whether rich or poor. 

A CONSTRUCTIVE CHURCH 

This Church is a constructive organization, spiritually as well as 
temporally. To achieve its great purposes justifies the cooperative effort 
of the entire Church membership in the use of their time, talents and 
means. The more universally and willingly the sacrifice, the greater will 
be the achievement, and the finer the development of the individual 
members. As we cultivate the unselfish attitude of seeking to maintain 
ourselves, and also of aiding in the fulfilment of the destiny of this great 
work, we shall grow in that spiritual faith and power which comes from 
our eternal Father. 

May the Lord bless and help us to grow in patience, helpfulness and 
kindliness, which will enable us to gain spiritual strength; and at the 
same time help us to develop those standards of industry, initiative and 
resourcefulness which will enable us to become independent in a temporal 
way. I pray for these blessings, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

Stewart Hewlett. 

ELDER SAMUEL O. BENNION 

of the First Council of the Seventy and President of the Central States 

Mission 

I feel very humble, my brethren and sisters, in occupying this 
position, and I pray that I may be led to say that which will be best 
for me to say upon this occasion. 

First, I want to express my gratitude and appreciation for the fine 
choice the Presidency of the Church and the Council of the Twelve 
have made in the appointment of President Callis to the Council of 
the Twelve, and of Brother Taylor to the Council of the Seventy. I have 
known these men a long while, and I know that they will be welcomed 



38 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

in all the Stakes where they shall go, and that they will be richly en- 
dowed as a result of their experience and their faith. 

President Grant gave us a wonderful message this morning in his 
address. I was greatly impressed by that passage of scripture referred 
to in the Doctrine and Covenants, 58th section (and I have used it many 
times in the mission field) wherein the Lord says: 

"Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do 
many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness; 

"For the power is) in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves. And 
inasmuch as men do good they shall in nowise lose their reward." 

Agents unto themselves ! That gives us to understand that we have 
the principle of free agency in us. We can do or not do. We can read, 
we can work, or we can neglect our work. The power is within us. 
The Lord appointed men to carry on his work. He led them in the path 
whereby they might gain a testimony and might know and understand 
his work; but the freedom of choice is left with his sons and with his 
daughters. 

There is no place in the world, nor an organization anywhere that 
offers so much for its membership, through the priesthood and through 
its auxiliaries, as does the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 

Much responsibility rests upon the priesthood quorums, and great 
blessings come to them. Men who are anxious concerning their appoint- 
ment and the work that is entrusted to them, who are all the time 
thinking about it, planning about it, trying to bring about in the best 
possible way the fulfilment of their duties and appointments, will feel 
greatly the power and influence of the Spirit of the Lord. 

There is fine leadership in this Church. The men with whom we 
are associated all the time are anxiously engaged in their work. They 
labor earnestly early and late for the establishment of Zion, and con- 
stantly preach faith and works and set an example unto us that all of 
us can profit by, if we take advantage of the opportunity afforded us. 

There never was a time during my period of service when there 
were better opportunities than now afforded, in the preaching of the 
Gospel, both at home and abroad. There never was a time when leader- 
ship was more needed than now, in every phase of man's existence. 
The people are looking for men to lead them. They are disturbed and 
heartsick because of disappointment. They are not fed the bread of life. 
They don't understand it. They live and they die without any hope, 
because they have not had opportunities which will enable them to receive 
the blessings of God, our Father, that they are entitled to. I feel that 
it is our duty to a very great extent to provide this spiritual food. 

As I travel in the mission field, and especially in the section where 
I live and have lived for so many years, I ask myself : Am I reaching 
the men and women with whom I associate, as I know I should do? 
When I get on the other side can I be justly accused of neglect ? 

There isn't any question in my mind but that, if we could get people 
to thinking, they would revere the plan of life and salvation. They 
would understand that we do not worship the Prophet Joseph Smith 



ELDER SAMUEL 0. BEN N ION 39 

or the other leaders of the Church, but that we do honor these men. We 
honor and respect them because the Lord selected them and placed 
them in authority so that the Gospel could be brought again to the 
children of men. 

It is in the hearts of thousands of people to believe the Gospel. 
I said there never was a greater time than now, and I believe it. Every- 
where one goes there is an opportunity to hold meetings. Men could 
go out in the mission field for a few months at a time, if not longer — 
men who are experienced — and with very little money could hold 
meetings among the congregations of the people of the country. There 
would be many who would listen to them. Even now, though we are 
reaching only a few, comparatively, just a few men and women, it is 
marvelous the way the work of the Lord is growing in the earth. 

The position that we occupy is a most worthy one and we should 
magnify it. If we could ourselves feel the importance of our calling; 
if we could feel that we were called and appointed before the foundation 
of the earth was laid, as Alma the prophet said, if we could feed and 
feast more upon the glorious principles that the Lord has revealed, it 
would greatly enrich our souls and give us a greater desire to do for him 
that which he would have us do. 

I know full well that we shall live again. I know that the Lord 
revealed all that the Prophet Joseph said he revealed to him. I know 
that when we sing, "Praise to the man who communed with Jehovah," 
that Jesus did anoint him a prophet and seer, and that he blessed him to 
open this the last dispensation, and that "kings shall extol him and na- 
tions revere." This will be brought more forcibly to the attention 
of the world from now on than ever before. 

When we sing, "Praise to the man who communed with Jehovah," 
in our hearts and with our voices, we do know that the Lord did call 
and did reveal unto him the priesthood, and gave him the power and 
the right to act in his name! And nations do revere him in all the 
civilized world, where missionaries have gone. We find men and women 
everywhere singing praises unto God and revering that man unto whom 
the Lord revealed himself. 

May we, my brethren and sisters, do our part. My prayer and 
heart's desire have always been that we will walk in the path of rectitude ; 
that we will follow our file leaders ; that we will ourselves study the 
things the Lord has revealed ; that we will take to heart that which the 
Lord's servants called to our attention this morning. It came from 
God. I am a witness of it. I bear testimony of it to you in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER GEORGE S. ROMNEY 

President of the Northern States Mission 

My brethren and sisters, I am happy to bring to you a word from 
the Northern States Mission. The Elders and Saints are well and en- 
joying the spirit of the Gospel. It is interesting to note the difference 



40 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

in the spirit of people as you meet them in the world, as you meet them 
among the Latter-day Saints and the missionaries in the mission field, 
and as you meet them in the stakes of Zion at home. We who are 
separated from you notice the difference. 

President Grant said this morning that that person who found 
fault with him for talking about the Word of Wisdom indicated by his 
talk that he was not faithful in keeping that law. I have sometimes 
thought that people who find fault with others, and who criticize the 
General Authorities of the Church, and also ward and stake authorities, 
are simply using that criticism as a camouflage; that they are trying to 
raise a smoke screen to hide themselves by getting others to turn their 
attention to the apparent faults of our brethren. 

I have been taught since I was a child to pray for the authorities of 
the Church, and I think I have always done it. But recently my prayers 
have changed, somewhat, in that I am now praying more earnestly that I 
may have the strength and the power and the wisdom to sustain the au- 
thorities of the Church, as well as asking the Lord to bless them with in- 
spiration and revelation. It seems to me that the Latter-day Saints should 
turn their attention more to this particular phase of calling upon the Lord 
for strength, that we, as members of the Church, may see to it, in all that 
we say and in all that we do, we sustain the authority of the Priesthood 
which God has given to us in these latter days. 

I have but a few moments to speak, and I should like to say some- 
thing about that which you must all be interested in, which is happening 
in Chicago at the present time. There comes very forcibly to my mind 
now the visit of President B. H. Roberts about a month ago. He went 
to Chicago to speak to the World's Fellowship of Faiths. This great 
institution is in a way the follower or the outcome of the World's Parlia- 
ment of Religions, which was held forty years ago. It was known to 
the officials of this organization that Brother Roberts had been in 
Chicago forty years ago, and had not been permitted to speak in the 
general assembly. In the introduction that was given to him this fact 
was referred to as indicative of the change in public opinion. President 
Roberts was honored, it seems to me, more than any other of the dis- 
tinguished people who spoke in the many meetings of that organization. 
He gave to the people a message, in fact, two great messages. He 
spoke of the Prince of Peace, and how that peace might come to the 
world by giving justice, social and economic justice, to all mankind. 
He was powerful in his discourse, and there will be written in the books, 
the records of that great convention, as one of the first and foremost 
messages given, that which was given by Brother Roberts during the 
last days of his life here upon the earth. 

I wish you could go into the booth and see the exhibit in the Hall of 
Religions that has be.en made by the Church to which we belong, and 
listen to your young men and young women who are there working. 
I believe that there would be many more of the young men and young 
women of the Latter-day Saints desire to go on missions, and be 
willing to sacrifice themselves in order to go on missions, if they could 



ELDER GEORGE S. ROMNEY 41 

feel the spirit of those young men. There are probably from three 
thousand to five thousand people each day who stop to listen as they 
give to them the message. It is a living message. 

Our booth is in the Hall of Religions where many other religious 
faiths have made exhibits, and it is outstanding on account of the spirit 
of it. The figures in the paintings and the sculpture work seem to be 
living individuals — they look as if they could speak. They are out- 
standing. They are different. They are symbolical of the work that 
is done in the Church. They tell the story of the work of our Relief 
Society, our Sunday Schools, our missionary work, our Young Men's 
and Young Ladies' Mutual Improvement work; and especially do they 
depict most beautifully the ideals of the "Mormon" home, as the father 
sits with the child in his arms, and the mother stands with her arm 
over the shoulder of a boy scout. 

These young men who lecture almost continuously for twelve hours 
every day, for the five months of the Fair, are filled with the spirit and 
enthusiasm of missionary work, as they deliver the great message which 
we have to give to the world. And I bear testimony, as Brother Bennion 
has done just before me, that the world is hungry. The people stop and 
listen, and you may go into that booth any time of the day, when the 
rest of the hall is filled or when there are but few there, and there will 
always be a group filling that booth of ours. 

I wish that this spirit, the testimony of the Gospel of Jesus Christ 
which fills the hearts of your young men and young women in the 
mission field, could be in the hearts of all of you people. I believe it is 
important in the education of every boy and every girl that they take a 
mission, and know something of missionary work as well as something 
of college work. While I believe in college work, I believe that the 
missionary work is the most needed and the most outstanding experience 
in a person's education. 

May the Lord bless us, and fill us with the spirit of this great work, 
I ask in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL 

of the First Council of the Seventy 

I presume that in the past forty-one years I have trained the Latter- 
day Saints, in this tabernacle, so they are always somewhat anxious as 
to what success I will have. During this time I have always been 
anxious, having only one desire, and that is, to say .something, under 
the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, that would be for my good and for 
your good. The Lord knows my desires and will give to me his Holy 
Spirit. 

I shall not attempt to preach a lengthy discourse. I realize that 
time is quite a factor in a general conference especially, as President 
Grant is noted for wanting as many of the brethren to speak as possible. 

It might be well to inform you that I was ordained one of the 
Fiist Council of the Seventy October 8th, 1892. When I became a 



42 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

member of the Council there were such men as Seymour B. Young, 
Christian D. Fjeldsted, John Morgan, Brigham H. Roberts and George 
Reynolds who were among the greatest missionaries of our day. I have 
associated with them a great many years, and in thinking of them since 
Brother Roberts passed away, I could not help but feel that they were 
men of God ; that no mistake was made ; that they were called by revela- 
tion. All of these brethren have gone home. I am the only one 
living that was associated with them. After the date of my ordination, 
Rulon S. Wells, Edward Stevenson and Joseph !W. McMurrin filled 
vacancies within about five years. 

I think there is no man living in the flesh that knew Elder Roberts 
any better than I did. There was an affection, a friendship, formed in 
the missionary field that exceeds any love I have ever known, outside 
of my own family. 

A missionary friend, Charles Welch, called on me yesterday. He is 
now a patriarch in the Bighorn stake. He was formerly a counselor 
to the president of the stake. He came to my home yesterday to see me. 
I traveled with him one year under Elder Roberts' presidency in Virginia. 
I know of no better man than Brother Charles Welch. He was a young- 
man when I was laboring with him fifty years ago, but he told me yester- 
day he is now seventy-three years old. Ours is a keen friendship, a 
brotherhood that will last through life and will continue in the other 
world. Why ? Because he never forsook me. He was to be trusted. I 
was sick and he ministered to me and was so kind and patient. I had 
boils — called carbuncles, if you know what a carbuncle is. I don't know 
what kind of boils Job had, but if he had carbuncles I am in full sym- 
pathy for him. They started on one of my wrists and they followed 
me all the way up and down. The last one I had was on my knee. We 
had reached Burkes" Garden at that time, after traveling nearly one 
thousand miles without purse and scrip. 

I am trying to make clear to you, if I can, the friendship that we 
Mormon elders have for one another. I may not be gifted in coupling 
together all of those beautiful sentiments and words, but friendship 
of the kind I am talking about cannot be told in words. Brother Welch 
said to me : "Golden, I have come six hundred miles to this conference, 
and one of my big objects was to see you." 

The first time I ever saw Elder Roberts was either in Cincinnati 
or St. Louis. He had been chosen as president of the Southern States 
Mission to succeed John Morgan. I left for Chattanooga, Tennessee, 
with twenty-seven elders assigned to the Southern States. There were 
all kinds of elders in the company — 'farmers, cowboys, few educated — 
a pretty hard looking crowd, and I was one of that kind. The elders 
preached, and talked, and sang, and advertised loudly their calling as 
preachers. I kept still for once in my life ; I hardly opened my mouth. 
I saw a gentleman get on the train. I can visualize that man now. I 
didn't know who he was. He knew we were a band of Mormon elders. 
The elders soon commenced a discussion and argument with the stranger, 
and before he got through they were in grave doubt about their message 



ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL 43 

of salvation. He gave them a training that they never forgot. That 
man proved to be President B. H. Roberts. 

On arriving at Chattanooga I was appointed to labor in Virginia 
with Elder Landon Rich. I traveled for one year under his direction. 
President Roberts called me to the office the second year — 1884. I slept 
with him. I talked with him. He trusted me, and I never betrayed 
him. He confided in me, the only time in his life, about his own affairs, 
his family, etc. We occupied one room — used as office and sleeping 
quarters. We paid $25.00 a month for rent and board. It was hotter than 
hades most of the time. I was his secretary. He walked the floor and 
dictated, and I wrote longhand volumes and stored away a fund of 
information. I was with Brother Roberts at the time of the Kane 
Creek Massacre, as I was at Shady Grove and was the first to get the 
information of the killing of Elders Gibbs, Berry and the Condor boys, 
and that they were buried. I was with Brother Roberts when he went 
out into a cornfield to disguise as a farm laborer. We kneeled down and 
prayed, and we discussed the matter and were satisfied that we should 
secure the bodies. I said : 

"Brother Roberts, let me go. They know you in that section. You 
have preached there. They will kill you. Let me go." 

He said, "No, I am the president of the mission. The Lord will 
take care of me." 

Eight members of the First Council have died since I was ordained 
on October 8, 1892, and there isn't one of that number who was so 
close to me as Brigham H. Roberts. I never felt more lonely or helpless, 
in a way, than I do now. Brother Roberts has been my mentor ; he has 
been my teacher ; he has been my chronicler. I was relieved of reading 
the great histories; I didn't have to read a whole library searching for 
information. What did I have to do ? When anything troubled me about 
the history of the Church or scripture, I went to Brother Roberts. He 
had the most wonderful mind and memory of any human being I have 
ever known, right up to the very last. A great light has gone out in my 
life. I will soon follow. 

I am now what they call the Senior President of the First Council 
of the Seventy. It is not altogether merit. It is just the regular order 
of things in the Church, just as it is with the Twelve Apostles. I have 
had the tenacity to outlive my fellow laborers. I have given forty-one 
years of my life whole-heartedly for the Seventies. The First Council 
are all presidents equal in authority. As much as I honor and respect 
Brother Roberts I have never felt inferior to him in his presence ; he has 
never made me feel that way. He had a greater intellect, greater intelli- 
gence, but I have had some gifts of my own, that in a way were equal to 
his. I have preached by his side many times, and after he got through 
preaching I reached those that he missed, so it has been that way during 
all this time. He often said when in the south, "Our love is akin to that of 
David and Jonathan." 

One other thing I want you to know. I am not currying favor; 
I am sick of such things. You can't say anything in this Church without 



44 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

someone thinks you are catering to somebody. It's in accordance with 
my calling as senior president to comment on the appointment of Elder 
John H. Taylor, who has been chosen and sustained to fill the vacancy 
caused by President Roberts' death. We welcome John as a member of 
the First Council. I knew him when and about the time he filled his 
first mission. When he filled his second mission he was a seventy. We 
were ransacking the whole Church for missionaries, and were not meet- 
ing with great success. In conversing with me about a mission he said : 
"I am ready to go." He was appointed to labor in Belgium. I have 
had due respect for and confidence in his faith, loyalty and integrity. I 
respect him for what he has done and will do in the future. He is a 
grandson of President John Taylor, and I cannot think of a man that 
has sacrificed more for the Church than President Taylor did. It was 
under his presidency that I reported for my first mission in 1883. I 
knew John H. Taylor's father very well, having always been on friendly 
terms with President John Taylor's family. 

I represent in a way my race of people. I may be of rugged in- 
dividualism, but if there is one thing I am proud of it is that I am Heber 
C. Kimball's son. I want to ask you people in confidence, don't you 
think he is entitled to a representative? 

I want to say another thing. jWe now have Brother Ivins, Brother 
Bennion, and Brother Taylor in the First Council of the Seventy. I 
am telling you straight, there are not over thirty per cent of our Seventies 
that are active, although they are just as active as the rest of the priest- 
hood. What are we going to do about it ? They will not come to Us ; we 
will have to go to them. There is the greatest opportunity for missionary 
work to be done among the quorums of Seventy who are or should be 
special witnesses for God, of any place I know. 

Remember, I pray you, that our Savior did not wait for his chil- 
dren to come to him. He went to them. If they were hungry, he fed 
them. If they were sick, he healed them. If they were in sorrow, he 
comforted them. If they were ignorant, he taught them. If they were 
distressed, he encouraged them. If they were burdened with sin, he 
proclaimed to them his Father's forgiveness, if they would repent and 
sin no more. 

There is no greater responsibility, requiring greater kindness and 
love and patience and the Spirit of God, than to go out among the 
Seventies and encourage them to do their duty. God bless you. Amen. 

ELDER CHARLES E. ROWAN, JR. 

President of the Texas Mission 

My brethren and sisters, I am reminded of the scripture that says, 
"Prophecy came not in old time by the will of man, but holy men ot 
God spake as they were moved upon by the Holy Ghost." 

I have enjoyed the conference immensely thus far. As I have 
heard the words as they have come from the prophets of the Lord I have 
rejoiced, and hope that all Israel will heed these wonderful messages. 



ELDER CHARLES A. ROWAN, JR. 45 

As one who is not a member of the general authorities, may I 
express my feeling of gratitude to our heavenly Father in the selection 
of these worthy men who have been called to help lead and direct Israel. 
I believe that no finer men could be found in the Church, and yet I 
appreciate that in this Church we have many mighty, stalwart leaders, 
who are gifted and talented. 

It has been my pleasure to be acquainted with President Callis for 
twenty-four years. I have had the opportunity of sleeping with him, 
eating with him, visiting with him, and enjoying his friendship and 
confidence, and have had the pleasure of listening to him preach to the 
people in the mission field, a rare privilege. 

I had the opportunity of meeting Brother Taylor first eleven years 
ago, when he came into the Garfield Stake of Zion, representing the 
Mutual Improvement Association. I think he will remember the in- 
troduction. We met him in Marysvale with a Model T Ford and took 
him to Escalante where the conference was to N be held. Some of the 
pitches over the mountain were eighteen per cent and the Ford could 
hardly make the grade. Sometimes it was necessary for the passengers 
to walk and Brother Taylor had to help push it over the mountain. More 
than that, we had a baby girl called Rachel, and at times he carried 
her in his arms. He said : "Oh, I think Rachel is the finest name in the 
world." I thought of that when he referred to his kind, sweet wife here 
today. I am sure the Saints in the wards and stakes will be delighted 
with these appointments. 

I am happy, brethren and sisters, to bring you greetings from the 
Saints and missionaries in the Texas mission. Your sons and daughters 
are well. They are bearing testimony to the people, wherever they can, 
that God, our Father, has spoken in this generation of time; that no 
greater mission has ever been given to any people than has been com- 
mitted to us as members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints. 

I bring you greetings from the Saints, and say to you that they are 
honest, God-fearing people in the main; that we have had an increase 
in our numbers who have paid tithes and fast-offerings this year ; that 
our auxiliary organizations are all fully organized, and we are antici- 
pating increased activity this coming winter. We have had considerable 
increase in the activities, particularly in our genealogical work. In 
checking it over the other day I discovered an increase -of 862 per cent 
in the names that have passed through the mission office for the temples 
this year. Really the spirit of Elijah is resting upon the people, not 
only those who are members of the Church, but the people in general 
seem to be interested in finding out who their ancestors were. We are 
grateful for this. 

I am happy, my brethren and sisters, in this great calling. I have 
never enjoyed anything so much in my life. I am grateful for the testi- 
mony that I have that Jesus Christ is actually the Son of the living God. 
I am grateful for my association with these fine sons and daughters of 
yours. I wish to say to you that they are indeed servants of the true 



46 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

and the living God; that they are anxious to go forward and proclaim 
the truth, and they are doing all they can everywhere to preach the 
Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. 

I want to read a statement here that was made by the Savior 
during his ministry. He said : 

"All things are delivered unto me of my Father; and no man knoweth the 
Son but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he 
to whomsoever the Son will reveal him." 

I am also reminded of the fact that he said : 

"And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and 
Jesus Christ, whom thou hast s'ent." 

Here we find that no one can know that Jesus is the Christ, and that 
God is our eternal Father, unless it is revealed to him by Jesus Christ. 
When Jesus was about to depart from this life he said: 

"And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that 
he may abide with you forever." 

"Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all 
truth : for he shall not speak of himself ; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall 
he speak: and he will show you things to come." 

A glorious promise that has been fulfilled and is being enjoyed by 
faithful Latter-day Saints everywhere! 

I certify in words of soberness that you who have testimonies 
and have received this revelation from Almighty God, according to that 
which our Master has said, have the assurance of life eternal. 

May God bless us all. May you be able to sustain your missionary 
sons and daughters in the field. May you who have sons and daughters, 
and you who are experienced be endowed with power from on high, 
with a determination to go forward and help to reap, because truly the 
field is white, ready to harvest. May we be sustained and profit by the 
good things we hear in this conference, and support our leaders, I pray 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

"Unfold ye portals," an anthem, was sung by The Singing Mothers, 
after which the closing prayer was offered by Elder Heber C. Austin. 
Conference adjourned until 10 o'clock Saturday, October 7. 

A sacred solo, "A poor wayfaring man of grief," was sung by 
Elder Charles Martin, immediately following the opening prayer First 
Session. 

When announcing that Brother Martin would sing "A poor way- 
faring man of grief," President Grant made the following comment : 

This hymn was sung twice in Carthage Jail by John Taylor just 
prior to the martyrdom of the Prophet and the Patriarch. After having 
sung it once Brother Taylor was asked by the Prophet to sing it again. 
Brother Taylor replied that he did not feel like singing. The Prophet 
requested him to sing it once more and suggested that he would feel 
better after doing so. 

Shortly after Brother Taylor had sung the hymn the second time 
the firing commenced which caused the death of the Prophet and the 
Patriarch, and four bullets lodged in Brother Taylor's body. 



SECOND DAY 
MORNING MEETING 

The Conference reconvened Saturday morning, October 7, at. 10 
o'clock. 

The congregation sang the hymn, "High on the mountain top." 

Elder Robert D. Young, President of the Sevier Stake offered the 
opening prayer. 

"Now let us rejoice in the day of salvation" was sung by the con- 
gregation. 

ELDER RULON S. WELLS 

of the First Council of the Seventy 
"Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved." 

There is nothing in the scriptures that is truer than this saying, 
Believe on him and thou shalt be saved. But when we refer to belief 
on the Lord Jesus Christ, having faith in him, we mean a living faith, 
not a dead faith. 

A living faith in the Lord Jesus Christ will secure salvation to 
every soul that believes on him. It doesn't need any qualification, if we 
only have a proper understanding of what is meant by a living faith. 
In order to get a proper conception of it it is well to hark back to that 
primeval day that we read of in the revelations contained in the Pearl 
of Great Price. Hark back to that time also that is referred to in the 
Bible when the Lord spake unto his servant Job, and said unto him : 

"Where wast thou when I laid the foundations 1 of the earth? declare, if thou 
hast understanding. 

"When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted 
for joy?" 

Where wast thou, Job, and where were you, my brethren and 
sisters? We were in the spirit world, in the presence of our Father. 
And what was it that we were shouting about ? It was the promulgation 
of the great plan of life and salvation that was made known to the 
children of God, begotten of him in the spirit, before the foundations of 
this earth were laid, and consequently before we had received these 
bodies of flesh and bones. When we heard those glad tidings our hearts 
were filled with joy. It was a plan whereby we might go on to perfec- 
tion. It involved the creation of this world; it involved the placing 
upon this planet of our Father's children in bodies of flesh and bones. 
It involved also the fall. It involved a redemption from the fall. It 
involved the earth-life experiences as the best and only means of edu- 
cating and preparing ourselves to become the children of God, members 
of His household, his sons and daughters in the celestial kingdom of 



48 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

God. That required a stupendous work and it required someone to 
carry out the divine program, and the question arose, 'Whom shall I 
send?" And there was one like unto the Son of Man arose in that 
mighty multitude, and said, "Here am I, send me. Thy will be done, 
and the glory be thine forever." 

That was Jesus Christ, the Lord, our Elder Brother, the first 
begotten of our Father in the spirit. But there was another one in 
that mighty multitude, also a strong personality, a great power among 
our Father's children who had been laboring to lead men and women 
away from God. He did not like the plan, for that plan was one of 
faith, one of repentance from sin, the only means of progress. He 
wanted none of that, but he said, "Here am I, send me. I will be thy 
son, and I will redeem all mankind, that one soul shall not be lost, and 
surely I will do it : Wherefore give me thine honor." 

He was ambitious and he proposed compulsion, which is contrary to 
the will of God. Free agency is God's plan. Men must in the exercise 
of their own agency choose between good and evil if they would make 
progress. 

When we heard these glad tidings that were promulgated I tell you 
we were glad. Our hearts were filled with joy and gladness and we 
shouted for joy, at the prospect of becoming like God and dwelling in 
his presence forever. That was what we were shouting about. 

Well, God said, "I will choose the first," and Satan grew angry, for 
that is who it was — Lucifer, a son of the morning — Satan, or the devil, 
whatever you may call him. He it was who rebelled against God, and 
he took after him one-third of the hosts of heaven. So he must have 
been a powerful personality, leading men and women away from God's 
plan. 

God said, "I will send the first," and Satan grew angry and rebelled 
against God. All this we read in the Pearl of Great Price. 

Now to accept of him whom God did send is faith. To reject him 
whom God did not send, but cast out of heaven, is repentance ; and so 
when you hear people say, "I do not want to hear about these first 
principles, I know all there is to know about them," I want to tell you, 
my brethren and sisters, there is not anything beyond these fundamental 
principles of the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. Every doctrine of 
the Church, every sermon that has been preached from this pulpit, 
has to do with faith in God and repentance from sin. Every discourse 
that has been delivered in this conference, no matter by what name it 
may be called, or what may be the subject, is a concrete example of these 
fundamental principles and the application of them to our lives. 

These doctrines of faith in God and repentance from sin are all- 
inclusive. That is the kind of Gospel that we have received. The 
Apostle Peter knew so well the meaning of all this when he declared ; 

"We have also a more sure word of prophecy ; whereunto ye do well that ye 
take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the 
day star arise in your hearts; 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS 49 

"Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private 
interpretation. 

"For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man; but holy men of 
God Spake as they were moved upon by the Holy Ghost." 

That is exactly the condition that the Apostles of today proclaim. 
Scripture comes not by the will of man. 

We have been sustaining in this conference the men whom God 
has chosen to stand at the head of this people as prophets, seers, and 
revelators, men whom God has chosen to stand at the head ot this 
Church. We ofttimes sing, "We thank thee, O God, for a prophet." 
How grateful we ought to be that this Church is founded upon Apostles 
and Prophets, as the church was in days of old! To accept of their 
message, their counsel, is to have faith in the word of God, and living 
faith manifests itself in the works of obedience, and every work of 
obedience is founded upon faith. Did we not believe in God we surely 
would not believe in his prophets. If we had no faith in the Lord Jesus 
Christ of course we would not render obedience to his Gospel. But 
because God chose him to carry on his great work as the leader, his 
Only Begotten Son, he sent him into the world, "For God so loved 
the world that he gave his Only Begotten Son, that whosoever believeth 
in him should not perish, but have everlasting life." If we believe on 
him we render obedience to his Gospel and live by every word that pro- 
ceedeth forth from the mouth of God, whether God reveals his will 
to us directly or through his constituted authorities upon the earth, 
his prophet, seer, and revelator, his servants who have been chosen 
and supported and sustained by his people. These are the ones God 
has chosen, and to accept of their message and their counsel is faith. 

To keep the commandments of God of course requires faith. The 
keeping of the commandments means works of obedience, whereby we 
demonstrate whether our faith is a living faith and not a dead faith. 
A dead faith has nothing to do with our religion. We say that faith 
without works is dead. We do not mean a living faith without works 
is dead. There could not be a living faith under those conditions. 
Only a faith that manifests itself in works of obedience has within itself 
the power of God to the salvation of his children. So faith is all- 
inclusive, and likewise repentance is all-inclusive, for it has to do with 
everything that we have to do with. To reject him whom God did not 
send is repentance, and when we speak of rejecting him we mean re- 
jecting his gospel, rejecting his plan, rejecting his sophistry, and his 
arguments, and there are many of them in the world today, and it 
behooves Latter-day Saints to choose whom they will follow — Jesus 
Christ the Lord and his glorious Gospel, or the devices of the adversary 
that lead us away from God. Every sophistry and every sin and every 
allurement of evil is prompted by that evil one that was cast out of 
heaven. He is with us here. He was cast down and is right here, not 
in a body of flesh and bones ; no, he did not fulfil his first estate, but he 
came just the same, and we cannot see him with our natural eyes, 
He has no body of flesh and bones, but he is here, and we feel his power 



SO GENERAL CONFERENCE 

and his influence, we see it everywhere leading men and women away 
from the truth. 

"Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. Draw nigh to God, 
and he will draw nigh to you." To resist the devil is repentance. To 
draw nigh unto God is faith. Apply this to everything, to all of our 
actions, to everything that we do, our merchandising, our business tran- 
sactions, our farming, our pleasures, our dancing. There is a right way 
and a wrong way to do everything. When we do it in a right way those 
are the works of obedience, whereby we demonstrate our faith. If we 
do it the wrong way we are committing sin and we are called upon to 
repent. That is the substance of the Gospel. It applies to our politics, 
it applies to every problem that comes before us. 

We have the word of the leaders of this people as to what should 
be our course in regard to certain political things. I do not wish to 
get into any political discussion or anything bordering on that, but let 
me tell you where good and evil are involved, as they are in the prohi- 
bition question, it devolves upon Latter-day Saints to choose the right 
and therefore manifest our faith in God and reject the sophistries and 
the false arguments of those who are trying to break down the safe- 
guards of our Constitution. 

My time has already expired. May God help us to carry on this 
great work by living in accordance with his divine will as it shall be 
made manifest to us through his prophets, seers, and revelators, I pray 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER ALONZO A. H'INCKLEY 

President of the California Mission 

I am exceedingly happy this morning. We have just listened to 
the remarks of Elder Rulon S. Wells. My heart has thrilled as he has 
spoken unto us. He was my mission president in days long ago. While 
upon that mission the Lord sent unto me a son, and it was in the heart 
ojf the mother of that son to name him "Rulon." I loved this man in 
the days of my younger manhood. I loved him for his faith, for his 
devotion, for his tenderness. I love him today. As I sat here today and 
looked up into his face, heard his ringing testimony, and his declaration 
anew of the first principles of the Gospel, and of their fundamental 
endurance, and the part they take in every action of our lives, I was fed. 
God bless him during his remaining days with peace and all the sweetness 
that he has earned. 

Yesterday was a very great day in my life. Everything seemed 
so beautiful, with the sun overhead, and though I came up from the 
flowery land of California, as I walked through these temple grounds 
I took off my hat, and I offered a prayer of thanksgiving for the peace, 
the beauty, and all that surrounds this sacred spot of ground. As I 
came into the tabernacle and I looked at the hosts of people, my heart 
thrilled again. I felt that I was in tune with the infinite ; that I was 
blessed more than it was possible for me to express. 



ELDER ALONZO A. HINCKLEY 51 

In the beginning of our conference when the name of Chas. A. 
Callis was read as the man to fill the place made vacant by the passing 
of Apostle James E. Talmage, I was filled with joy because I had been 
permitted by the goodness of the Lord to minister, as one called and set 
apart as an ambassador of truth, under President Callis. The vision 
went before my mind how the thousands that have grown up around 
President Callis in this last quarter of a century will lift their hearts 
in thanksgiving that their great leader has been called to this high council 
in the Church. 

Oh, how my soul rejoices to know that we live in a day when the 
Lord reveals his holy mind and will; that we are not left to walk in 
darkness; that it is our privilege to walk in the light, and that we can 
with safety follow those whom he has appointed. 

When President Grant, in his opening address, read so many 
wonderful things to us from the book of the Doctrine and Covenants, 
and then, in answer to an anonymous communication requesting that he 
should not mention the [Word of Wisdom, he, as the mouthpiece of the 
Lord, spoke out with courage words that should find lodgment in the 
hearts of all the Latter-day Saints, my joy was added to. He reaffirmed 
and confirmed all that he said six months ago as he opened that great 
conference. At that time we departed and carried the word wherever 
we went, as the word of the Lord given through his servant. He 
renewed that same message at this important time in our lives, and 
satisfied my soul. 

I recall how President Grant stood here six months ago and said 
that he had been contemplating the conditions that existed throughout 
the world, and he bore testimony that without the shadow of a doubt 
in his mind, the Lord had revealed — in a revelation given to the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, that covered not more than a page — the solution that 
would solve the perplexing problems of the world and then proceeded 
to read that great revelation and to make his comments. He added 
that it was not only for the Church and for the high priests and for 
the Saints of the last days, but it was for all the world, if they would 
listen and obey. 

We went back to the California Mission, and I suppose that all 
men in authority went back to their fields of labor and carried that 
message as we carried it in California, to every nook and corner. Did 
the Saints respond ? I bear testimony and say yes, they did, and though 
they had beer, and though they had light wines in abundance, throughout 
all the territory covered by the California Mission, I bear testimony to 
you that the Saints have, in the language of Brother Wells, and in the 
language of the Lord, "chosen the Lord," they have chosen to follow 
his servants. I bring you word from the thousands down there that they 
are temperate, sober-minded, faithful, good Latter-day Saints, that will 
compare with the good Latter-day Saints up here in these valleys of the 
mountains. I know that I speak with understanding when I say that 
they have these qualities in them. 

Many of them have propounded the question: "Brother Hinckley, 



52 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

now that the states, one by one, have voted as they have on this pro- 
hibition question, will Utah vote as other states have voted, or will she, 
when the world forsakes these standards and calls for those things, 
stand and be an example unto the world?" All I have been able to 
say is, "I hope so." What a lesson ! Many come back and ask of the 
men of the Church "How does the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints stand on this question ?" It stands for prohibition. It stands 
for freedom from the use of all these thing's, and for temperate lives 
among all of its people. The Lord has revealed that it is not good for 
man to touch any of these things. 

Now, I say, to have this counsel in our conference, renewed at 
this time by that great discourse, wherein the President of the Church, 
after giving his own testimony, read into that great address the testi- 
monies of Hyrum Smith, Brigham Young, John Taylor, Wilford Wood- 
ruff, Lorenzo Snow and Joseph F. Smith, bringing down to date the 
testimony of the servants of God, is a warning unto this people. 

For the Lord has declared, as I read — perhaps I can quote it ( Doc. 
and Cov., Sec. 1 :l-4) : 

"Hearken, O ye people of my church, saith the voice of him who dwells on 
high, and whose eyes are upon all men ; yea, verily I say, hearken ye people from 
afar, and ye that are upon the islands of the sea, listen together. 

"For verily the voice of the Lord is unto all men, and there is none to escape 
and there is no eye that shall not s'ee, neither ear that shall not hear, neither heart 
that shall not be penetrated. 

"And the rebellious shall be pierced with much sorrow, for their iniquities 
shall be spoken upon the housetops, and their secret acts shall be revealed. 

"And the voice of warning shall be unto all the people, by the mouths' of 
my disciples, whom I have chosen in these last days." 

Do we have it complete? Is it given unto us by the mouths of his 
disciples whom he has chosen in these last days ? Yes, verily yes ; and 
the Lord says that whether it is by his own voice or by the voice of his 
servants, it is the same. When they speak under the influence of the 
Holy Ghost, it is scripture ; it is the will of the Lord ; it is the voice 
of the Lord; it is the word of the Lord; it is the power of God unto 
salvation. 

To me, the warning is complete ; the vision is clear. I see the way. 
I feel to say, in the language of one of old, Joshua : "As for me and my 
house, we will serve the Lord." More than that, if it were within my 
power to persuade all men to forsake their evil ways and cleave unto 
the Lord, that would make me happy indeed. 

I should, of course, bear testimony of the Elders. Thirty-nine of 
them are all we have — the choicest of the choice — down in California. 
To their fathers, their mothers, their friends, their bishops, I say they 
are pure ; they are sweet ; they are wholesome. They are offering a con- 
secration unto the Lord, their time and their talents, their very best 
service. Twelve lady missionaries likewise ; all well, all happy, all sowing 
the seeds of truth, witnessing the results of their work. In these last 
nine months there have come into the Church, through the testimony 



ELDER ALONZO A. HINCKLEY 53 

that has gone out unto them, four hundred members, who declare that 
to them this is a new world ! 

I never was happier. I know the truth. I love it. I pray for power 
to live it and to be able to consecrate my life to his service, henceforth 
and forever, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I regret to announce that Brother Richard R. Lyman is confined to 
his bed on account of illness. He is on the high-road to "recovery 
however, for which we are very grateful. 

Brother Charles H. Hart is also unable to be with us on account of 
illness. 

I have received a message from Brother John A. Widtsoe, which 
I am pleased to read to you, as follows: 

"Read the history of man down the ages. Always truth has been compelled 
to fight its way through ferocious opposition. Over and over again someone has 
sealed truth with blood. Christ, in whom was only truth and all truth, was 
crucified unto death. 

Never was the universe of untruth more deeply stirred than when the Gospel 
of the Lord Jesus' Christ was restored in this age — the beginning of the end of 
the reign of anti-Christ. Centuries of apostasy had built a fortress of error 
supposedly impregnable to truth. Hell raged at truth's venture into a world claimed 
for its own. Persecution began, raged, and has continued for a century. 

truth's destiny 

Truth's destiny is victory. It breaks down every barrier of error. Ultimately 
it rises triumphantly above its vanquished enemy. After many trials and much 
tribulation, slowly, painfully it reaches its happy end. The masses of men love 
truth better than error, but are blinded by the clever presentations of the enemy 
of truth. 

Just so, the truth of the restored gospel is becoming understood in the world. 
The senseless persecution of the past is dying down. The essential purity and 
human value of the Gospel are becoming reoognized. 

THE DEVIL'S TRICK 

But, though driven into a corner, the opposition remains active. It plays its 
last card, the devil's trick. If persecution from without is diminishing, contention 
within is fanned into livelier flame. Of the two methods of destruction — persecu- 
tion by untruth or discord among those who have accepted truth — the latter is the 
deadlier. An inward is 1 more serious than an outward wound. 

This, then, is the sober warning to all Latter-day Saints : 

Persecution from without is gradually vanishing. For that we are grateful. 
But, at the same time, the danger of jealousy, strife and evil speaking among the 
members of the Church increases. Such internal persecution wrecks the strongest 
organization, even one founded in truth. 

Latter-day Saints should be forewarned of this 1 ancient satanic trick. Con- 
tention among members of the Church must be banished. Kind words must 
replace evil-speaking about fellow members. Generous good-will must stifle jealousy. 
Officers must be accepted, sustained and supported with heart and hand. There 
must be an honest endeavor to love our brethren and sisters as well as the Lord 
in heaven — the first law of Gospel living. 



54 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

THE POWER OF LOVE 

Love begets love. Whenever Latter-day Saints live in love together, their 
armour and their shield, all their weapons are of heavenly workmanship. The 
forces of evil flee in terror before them. Try it; the results never fail. The 
heart never beats so warmly as under the power of unselfish love. Whoever 
allows himself to cause contention in a ward or branch, or to spread it, whatever 
the means employed, plays into the hands of Lucifer and helps him win victory 
out of his sullen corner of defeat." 

ELDER DON B. COLTON 

President of the Eastern States Mission 

My brethren and sisters, last July, and within a few days after I 
had been appointed to the presidency of the Eastern States Mission, 
I had the privilege of attending a conference held at the Joseph Smith 
Farm and on the Hill Cumorah, near Palmyra, New York. It was my 
good fortune, at that time, to meet all of the missionaries laboring in 
the Eastern States Mission. While I have not had the time since to 
visit them in the districts in which they are laboring, I feel that I can 
say that we are carrying on in that part of the Lord's vineyard, as are 
the missionaries in the other parts of the world. 

Nearly a score of newspapers in the immediate neighborhood of 
Palmyra gave us much publicity, and reported in fairness and in detail 
the proceedings of our conference, in July. In fact, there were papers 
in that vicinity that had reporters at all of the sessions. This, you will 
remember, is in the vicinity of the birthplace of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints. It is a joy to me to think of the favorable 
change that has taken place in the world regarding this great Latter-day 
work. 

A few days ago, in the headquarters of one of the leading candi- 
dates who is seeking election as mayor of the great city of New York, 
I was told by this candidate — and he spoke, by the way, in the presence 
of fifty or more prominent men of that city — I say he told us at that 
time that he listened every Sunday morning to the program broadcast 
by the Tabernacle Choir. And then he added to that group of men : 
"It is the finest radio program given today," and advised all present 
to listen, if they were not already doing so. 

I was gratified to hear many of those present say they did listen 
to the program as broadcast by this great choir. I hope it will be 
some encouragement to Brother Lund and the members of this great 
musical organization, to know that their efforts are appreciated, and 
that men of standing in the world appreciate the wonderful music 
which they furnish from week to week. God bless them in the continua- 
tion of their great mission. They are helping us vitally in the preaching 
of the Gospel. 

I passed by one of the large churches in New York, a few days 
ago, and noticed this sign : "He who neglects the spiritual is living, but 
he is only half alive." I rejoice to belong to a church that is not neglect- 



ELDER DON B. COLTON 55 

ing the spiritual. In addition to the great teachings of the Church 
with respect to the physical, the mental and the moral, we lay great 
stress upon the spiritual. In my humble judgment, the world needs 
spiritual food now more than it needs anything else. We can never be 
wholly right until we get back to first principles, and emphasize again 
and anew the life taught by Christ and his disciples. If we are looking 
for heaven we can create it here. The mission of the Church is to 
proclaim the new light that has come into the world through the revela- 
tions of Jesus Christ. 

May I say a word to the young people, to the young men and women 
who may be present in this congregation or who may hear my voice? 
May I say a word also to the teachers of the young men and young 
women in this Church : Let us not take the negative side of life. Very 
little good has been really accomplished by men who took that attitude. 
It is the men who assume the positive attitude in life that accomplish 
worthwhile things. 

This is not a day for quarrel. We have no time for that. We have 
little if any time for argument. This is a day of affirmation, of procla- 
mation. This is the message of the hour : God lives ! He has revealed 
himself anew in our day. 

I say to the teachers, and to the young men who may be wandering a 
little, that if you will spend one-half the time looking for the proof 
that there is a God, that it will take you to find proof that there is none, you 
will be converted during the period. Why not do it? You will come 
back to it some day, and all of the time you are wandering in doubt 
and questioning the existence of a personal God, or the correctness of 
this faith or that, will have been lost. 

Science is helping us to be better Christians. Science is helping 
us to discover God. It is teaching us how to cooperate with him. It 
is teaching us how to live, giving us better homes, better ways of living. 
It is affirmative. It is only man's interpretation of science that is 
negative. There is no disagreement between true science and the 
revealed word of God. "Truth is truth, where'er 'tis found." 

In the moment that is left to me may I say further that the great 
mission of the missionaries, and of the Church, for that matter, is to give 
a true picture to the world of the greatest revelation ever given, namely, 
the revelation concerning God and his Son Jesus Christ. Much as we 
revere the Book of Mormon, much as we love it, it is but a witness, a 
new witness of Christ, the God of this land. It is around him that all 
truth centers. It is to preach him and him crucified that we are spending 
so much time and energy in the world. 

Much as we love and revere the name of Joseph Smith, his mission 
was only to proclaim the Savior of the world — to preach Christ and 
him crucified. Much as we respect the auxiliary organizations, even 
the organization of the Church itself, they are all given as helps in 
government, to bring us to Christ. His is the only name given whereby 
we must be saved. 

Oh, what a wonderful message it is ! 'What joy this sweet sentence 



56 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

gives: I know that my Redeemer lives." It is the message of the ages". 
Let us proclaim it, move up and out, so to speak, from any position of 
defensiveness that we have taken or may have assumed in the past — 
move out in a great drive for righteousness and for the salvation of 
the souls of men. There need be given no apology for "Mormonism." 
It is the Gospel of Jesus Christ. We are not ashamed to proclaim it. 

Thank God the world is rapidly growing to know us in our true light. 
Everywhere there the hand of fellowship and of friendship is extended, 
when men know of it. 

Not long ago, in one of the cities of this country, I spoke on the 
great philosophy of life as revealed in the Mormon doctrines or the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ. At the close of the meeting I was delighted to 
have a man come up and say to me: "I am a graduate of a great 
university. I was brought up in a religion that said, in effect, that we 
know not the origin of life, so far as the soul is concerned. It is one 
of the mysteries of God. I was brought up in a religion that taught 
me that as soon as we passed from this mortal existence our destiny in 
the hereafter was determined and we were given our place in the hereafter, 
and we should remain there forever. It was not until I heard the 
message of your people, that I learned of a great philosophy that explains 
in a perfectly reasonable way the origin of the spirit of man and that 
points the way to eternal progress and growth in development throughout 
the countless ages of eternity." He continued : "I have never seen or 
heard of a philosophy that compares with it, anywhere in the wide 
world, and I have given a great deal of study to religion." 

It is that message, that great philosophy, when translated into life, 
that constitutes the religion of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints. With boldness, but in the language of the great Lincoln, para- 
phrased : With charity toward all, with malice toward none, with firm- 
ness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us press, on in the 
duties that have come to us in the preaching of this Gospel. 

I have rejoiced and do rejoice in the spirit of this conference. I 
pray that there shall come into our lives, into our souls, the true 
message of the hour, that we shall go out from this conference and 
consecrate our lives anew to the building up of the church and kingdom of 
God, and that in our souls we shall sing gladly the hymn: 

"I'll go where you want me to go, dear Lord, 
Over mountain, or plain, or sea; 
I'll say what you want me to say, dear Lord, 
I'll be what you want me to be." 

God bless us in the discharge of our great responsibilities and 
duties, I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

At the request of President Heber J. Grant, the congregation arose 
and sang the hymn, "O say, What is truth ?" 



ELDER ANTOINE R. IVINS 57 

ELDER ANTOINE R. IVINS 

Of the First Council of the Seventy and President of the Mexican Mission 

My very beloved brethren and sisters, it is always with trepidation 
that I stand in this position. I pray that while I stand here this morning I 
may enjoy your faith and prayers, that perhaps some word that I may 
drop may be of comfort or blessing to you or to me. 

I have been more than pleased with the wonderful spirit of this 
conference. I bean- testimony that the things that have been said are 
true; that they pertain to the greatest thing in the world, the Gospel 
of Jesus Christ, and that if we will but adhere to those principles, observe 
them, and put them into practice in our daily lives, we will benefit by them. 

You are the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The 
officers who sit here upon the stand are not the Church. They, of course, 
are a part of it ; they are the guiding element in it, under the direction 
of the Spirit of God, but they are not the Church. They are only 
people who have been selected from the great body of the Church, to be 
your servants, to do the things that God desires done for your benefit 
and for the benefit of mankind. Perhaps none of them occupies his 
position through his own solicitations, and certain it is that none of them 
pretends to any superhuman or unnatural ability in the guidance of these 
affairs. They rely upon the Spirit of the Lord, just as any member of 
the great body of the Church would have to do, when called as men are 
from time to time to these positions ; and it is my testimony that they 
do enjoy the Spirit of the Lord. 

It seems to me that any member who begins to find fault with the 
things that are done would better first put himself in this position 
and ask himself if he could do better. It is most certain, I think, that 
almost without exception such a person would retreat from his position, 
and would immediately fall in line and sustain and uphold those iri 
authority. Now, unless the body of the Church does that, the leaders 
of the Church are helpless. God himself, through revelation, told the 
Church in early days that his great purposes in certain respects could 
have been accomplished if the people had sustained the leaders. 

Every man comes into the world with his free agency, and every 
man exercises it: sometimes to his advancement, sometimes to his 
disadvantage. Every man is entitled to the Spirit of the Lord to direct 
him, and if he lives as he should, he enjoys it. If he does not live as he 
should, he never has its companionship. I am certain that the body of 
this Church, the great majority of them live so that they enjoy this Spirit, 
and that they, with me, in holding up their hands to sustain these officers, 
mean just exactly what they say, that they will back up the authorities of 
the Church in the things they do for its benefit and blessing. 

I pray that we may enjoy, as the days and years advance, a greater 
outpouring of this Spirit, that we may expel from our midst the spirit 
of criticism and fault-finding that we are told is extant, that it may be 
replaced by a spirit of love and affection and esteem, and that under 



58 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

the influence of that spirit this great organization may go forward to 
its natural and normal fruition. 

I stand before you, as some of the other speakers have done, repre- 
senting the missionary work of this Church. We have an obligation. 
You have an obligation. We are your servants in attempting to guide 
that work in the nations of the earth. 

It is only a few days since I had the pleasure of talking with a 
young man who had recently returned from Brother Sloan's mission. 
He said : "It is our duty to warn the world, but when can we say that 
the world is warned ? Can we stand up and preach a sermon to a congre- 
gation, and retire and state that they have been warned ? By no means. 
A man is never warned until he understands and appreciates the truth 
of the message you give him." It is for that reason that we go into 
the world, and go over and over and over again the same territory, en- 
deavoring to impress the people with the truth of our message, to bring 
them to an understanding and a knowledge of it. 

My particular work, as you know, is with a foreign people. They 
are a numerous people and it is a great obligation. Believing as we do 
in the Book of Mormon, we have a special interest in the native peoples 
of the American continent. The other day I made a short census compu- 
tation, to see if I could determine, perchance, how many of those people 
there are with whom we would like to make contact. 

In the first place, our immediate labors are limited to the United 
States of America, so I was interested in knowing how many of these 
people we have in the United States. I find that the city of Los Angeles 
has more than 75,000 Mexican people living in it and its immediate neigh- 
borhood. I find that the state of Texas has more than 800,000 people of 
Mexican extraction. I find that in Arizona and New Mexico there are 
large numbers of them, though the number I did not learn. 

Then I went on to figure the population of Mexico, Central and 
South America. I find that in those nations there are nearly 100,000,000 
people, and perhaps one-fourth of them are of almost pure Indian blood, 
with another fourth or more, perhaps, that we would call mestizos. 
That figures a tremendous population. That figures a tremendous obli- 
gation. When will we ever be able to warn 50,000,000 people in that 
great expanse of territory; teach them the history of their ancestors; 
bear testimony to them that the Book of Mormon has been restored; 
bear testimony to them that the Church of Christ has been organized 
in the earth, and that they are to receive its benefits and blessings ? 

This is a tremendous obligation, and now we have just twenty-four 
young men and women endeavoring to spread that truth among them, 
aside from a few of their own blood who are laboring with us. I say 
that it is a tremendous obligation, and one that only the aid and Spirit 
of the Lord will enable us to carry on successfully. 

I would like to see the time come when we could put into the mission 
field a large force of men and women who would go into these nations 
and teach them intelligently the basic principles of Christianity, teach 



ELDER ANTOINE R. IVINS 59 

them of the restoration of the Gospel, and give them its benefits and 
blessings. 

We have as fine a group of young men and women as exists in the 
Church. I am sure they are doing a wonderful work. They are in- 
fatuated with it. They dislike to see the day come when they must be 
released, but come it must, especially now in view of these trying times. 
They almost invariably leave us with tears in their eyes, and say that 
they would like to stay, and will come back at the first opportunity. 

We are extremely thankful to the Lord for the testimonies he has 
given us in this great work, for the aid and assistance that he gives to 
his missionary emissaries in the field. 

I was reading, the other day, in a Spanish tract or pamphlet that is 
issued by the Mexican government, dealing with the early history as 
developed from archaeological studies of Mexico. There was a state- 
ment in it which interested me very greatly. This particular writer was 
dealing with the religion, as they think they have worked it out, of these 
early peoples, and of course it carried him on to a generalization of re- 
ligion. In it he said that in all peoples and among all nations there are 
only a few who appreciate the abstract principle of Deity, and can 
understand it, and because of that the clergy necessarily is limited to 
those very select few who become the priests of the nation ; and then for 
the people, the general people not so well indued with these peculiar 
powers, they raise up idols for them to worship, so that they may have 
some tangible vision of the thing they worship. It appealed to me as a 
strange and peculiar doctrine, so different, so far from our philosophy of 
life, so far from the philosophy of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints. 

If there is anything about our religion that we should appreciate 
it is its tangibility, it is the fact that it is a philosophy which man has 
reached, and puerile as he is, can understand. It is that, perhaps, that 
makes it so popular with the people, that gives them the great and 
satisfying enthusiasm for it. It is that which gives me comfort, the fact 
that I seem able to understand it ; that I do not have to go to a select few 
for interpretation of its meaning, because the Gospel, after all, is only 
the plan that God laid down for the sojourn of man in the earth, in the 
short time that he should spend here, to gain the experiences and ad- 
vantages of mortality. It has to be simple, because it is just that plan, 
the plan of life, and if it were not simple we would not be able to benefit 
by it. 

I trust that God will give us his Spirit, that we may understand 
the Gospel, that we may live it, that it may be the vitalizing element of 
our life, that it will give us the comfort, the peace and the joy that we 
should enjoy through the companionship of the Spirit of God. 

I pray his blessings upon us, that he may guide us constantly, 
in the name of Jesus, Amen. 



60 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

Yesterday, as I left this building at the close of the morning meeting 
I overheard a conversation between two brethren, and one of them said : 

"If any one has been in doubt as 1 to what he ought to do he should know it now." 

I have been thinking of that. It seems to me that any member of 
this Church who is doing his duty, who loves the Lord, and who en- 
deavors to keep his commandments, who has the spirit of prayer and 
faith and in humility is seeking to know the truth, ought not to be in 
doubt, especially in regard to questions that have constantly been before 
us. 

EVERY MAN WILL KNOW THE LORD 

I hope and pray for the time to come speedily, the time which has 
been spoken of by the prophet Jeremiah, when every man will know 
the Lord, when it will not be necessary for a man to teach his neighbor, 
saying, "Know the Lord," for they will know him from the least of 
them to the greatest of them. That time will come, but it seems from 
conditions today that it is a long way off. It may not be, but when it 
does come it will be because the love of truth is in the hearts of the 
people, because they seek righteousness and have the inspiration which 
they are entitled to receive through obedience, for the guidance of the 
Holy Ghost is promised unto all those who will be faithful and true. 

THE MEANING OF INTELLIGENCE 

We very frequently quote from one of the revelations the words 
of the Lord to this effect, that "The glory of God is intelligence," and 
I wonder if we ourselves really comprehend what it means. We stop 
in the middle of a sentence. That is not the end of the sentence, for 
the Lord says, "The glory of God is intelligence, or in other words 
light and truth." And then he adds that "light and truth forsaketh that 
evil one." 

When we have the Spirit of the Lord we have intelligence — light 
and truth — as we have been singing, "O say, what is truth ?" It is pure 
intelligence, if you please, and he who has it has the power to discern 
between right and wrong, truth and error, and he will follow righteous- 
ness. 

DUTY TO RAISE THE WARNING VOICE 

I rejoice in what has been said in this conference. I regret that 
any man if he claims membership in this Church would presume to close 
the mouth of the President of the Church. I feel that it is our duty to 
warn when we see dangers, and when we discover that there are members 
of the Church who do not seem to understand what course they should 
take. We have a perfect right to direct them. That is our duty. We 
would not be doing our duty at this conference if we did not do it. 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 61 

Let me read these words from the Lord to the prophet Ezekiel : 

"Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel : therefore 
hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me. 

"When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die ; and thou givest him not 
warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; 
the same wicked man shall die in his 1 iniquity ; but his blood will I require at thine 
hand. 

"Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from 
his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul. 

"Again, when a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness, and commit 
iniquity, and I lay a stumbling block before him, he shall die; because thou hast 
not given him warning, he shall die in his 1 sin, and his righteousness which he 
hath done shall not be remembered ; but his blood will I require at thine hand. 

"Nevertheless, if thou warn the rightecus man, that the righteous sin 
not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned ; also thou hast 
delivered thy soul." 

That is our duty. When we see evil lurking, when we see dangers 
confronting the people, and especially the Latter-day Saints, it is our 
duty to raise the warning voice, and not only in behalf of the Latter-day 
Saints, but to warn all people, for our mission is one that is world-wide, 
and we should warn all men and give them the opportunity of repentance, 
of serving the Lord and keeping his commandments if they will. If 
they will not, then we have saved our souls. We are clear from the blood 
of this generation. That is our duty. 

THE WORDS OF ISAIAH 

Now I would like to read a few more words, from the prophet 
Isaiah, but I am going to read them as we find them in the Book of 
Mormon. First let me say that the verses that I have just read are in 
the third chapter of Ezekiel. That is easy to remember. President 
Grant said yesterday that if you put the sixth of April and the sixth 
of October together, you have 66. This that I have read is found in the 
third chapter of Ezekiel. If you put three and three together you have 
thirty-three, and there you find it again, in the thirty-third chapter of 
Ezekiel. I want to read these words also given by the Lord through 
the prophet Isaiah which have a bearing upon the very day in which 
we live : 

"Wo unto them that rise up early in the morning that they may follow strong 
drink, that continue until night, and wine inflame them ! 

"And the harp, and the viol, the tabret, and pipe, and wine are in their feasts ; 
but they regard not the work of the Lord, neither consider the operation of his hands. 

"Therefore, my people are gone into captivity, because they have no knowledge ; 
and their honorable men are famished, and their multitude dried up with thirst. 

"Therefore, hell hath enlarged herself, and opened her mouth without measure ; 
and their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he that rejoiceth shall 
descend into it. 

"And the mean man shall be brought down, and the mighty man shall be 
humbled, and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled. 

"But the Lord of Hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and God that is 
holy shall be sanctified in righteousness. 

"Then shall the lambs feed after their manner, and the waste places of the 
fat ones shall strangers eat. 



62 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

"Wo unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as it were 
with a cart rope; 

"That say : Let him make speed, hasten his work, that we may see it ; and let 
the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw nigh and come, that we may know it. 

"Wo unto them that call evil good, and good evil, that put darkness for light, 
and light for darkness, that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter ! 

"Wo unto the wise in their own eyes and prudent in their own sight ! 

"Wo unto the mighty to drink wine, and the men of strength to mingle strong 
drink ; 

"Who justify the wicked for reward, and take away the righteousness of the 
righteous from him ! 

"Therefore, as the fire devoureth the stubble, and the flame consumeth the 
chaff, their root shall be rottenness, and their blossoms shall go up as dust ; because 
they have cast away the law of the Lord of Hosts, and despised the word of the 
Holy One of Israel." 

THE CONDITION OF THE WORLD TODAY 

I say that has reference to our day. It has reference to any day. 
We may apply it in our lives and in our times. This is the condition 
of the world today. They have turned from the Lord of Hosts, they 
have despised his law, they have turned unto iniquity. He has spoken 
unto them. He would, if they would listen, direct them in righteousness 
and in truth. He would give unto them his judgment, his statutes, his 
guidance, and lead them in paths of truth, but they will not. Men love 
darkness today rather than light, just as they did in the days of our 
Redeemer. They are blinded against truth and righteousness. They 
seek it not. Our mission is to proclaim it. 

SUCCESS DEPENDENT UPON ATTITUDE OF SAINTS 

What a wonderful thing it would be, what a power, if the members 
of this Church would stand unitedly as on e man for the truth ! What a 
glorious thing it would be if we could say, it is not necessary for a man 
to teach his neighbor to know God, because every one among us, from 
the greatest unto the least, knows him ! If we could say that even as 
members of this Church, what a power it would be. I am as satisfied as 
I am that I am here that there is an influence that radiates not only from 
the individual but from the Church. I believe that our success in the 
world depends largely upon the attitude of the Saints. If we were 
united wholly, in thought, in deed, in our actions ; if we loved the word 
of truth, if we walked in it as the Lord would have us do, then there 
would radiate from this community, from the bodies of the Latter-day 
Saints in all of these communities, out into all the world, an influence 
that would be irresistible. More honest men and women would be 
converted, for the Spirit of the Lord would go before us to prepare the 
way. As it is when we find those among us who do not keep the com- 
mandments of the Lord — there is a thread, if you please, that has been 
running through this conference — if they, this people, would keep the 
commandments of the Lord it would be a force and a power and influence 
that would break down opposition and would prepare people to receive 
the light of the everlasting Gospel; and when we fail to do it we take 
upon ourselves a responsibility that is dreadful in its consequences. 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 63 

OUR RESPONSIBILITY 

How will I feel, or you, when called before the judgment seat if 
someone shall point his finger at me or you and say that "if it had not 
been for the actions of this man or this group I would have received the 
truth, but I was blinded because they, professing to have the light, did 
not live it." 

May the Lord lead and direct us in righteousness, and help us to 
walk before him as he would have us walk in the light. Let us uphold 
and sustain the man who has the right to speak in the name of the Lord, 
not only to the Church but to the whole world, is my prayer in the name 
of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The congregation sang the hymn, "O ye mountains high." 
Elder Joseph Anderson offered the closing prayer. 
Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock p. m. 

SECOND DAY 

AFTERNOON MEETING 

The meeting commenced promptly at 2 o'clock p. m. 

President Heber J. Grant announced the opening hymn, "We thank 
thee, O God, for a prophet," which was sung by the congregation. 

Elder Horace Ray Pond, President of the Benson Stake, offered 
the invocation. 

Sister Judith Anderson Beard sang a sacred solo, "How beautiful 
upon the mountains." 

ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

I should like to take a little of the precious time of this conference 
to advocate patience. I regard patience as one of the finest of all the 
Christian virtues. It contemplates sympathy, charity, forbearance, sus- 
pension of judgment, and perhaps most of all, the ability to wait. 

Perhaps it was never harder to be patient than it is at the present 
time, and yet I think we have never been under the necessity of exer- 
cising patience more than now. 

SYMPATHY FOR UNEMPLOYED 

I have very deep sympathy for men and women who bear the chief 
burden of the depression ; for those who are out of employment, who 
have long been without work, who see their families in want ; who find, 
perhaps, their own self-respect slipping because they have been forced 
to accept of charity. I entertain great pity for them, I sympathize with 



64 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

them. I am well aware of the fact that it is a very difficult thing, as 
they undergo these privations and wait month after month, year after 
year, for an improvement in conditions, to hold their patience, but I 
bid them do so. 

EXPERIMENTAL POLICIES 

We are now called upon to support what purports to be a very 
comprehensive program for recovery. It is a complex program. In 
many respects it is an experiment, acknowledged so to be. Those who 
are students of our governmental history recognize the fact that in it 
there have been and are wide departures from established policies, some 
of which seem to contravene the very fundamental tenets of our gov- 
ernmental faith. I freely acknowledge that as I hear criticisms of this 
character directed toward some of the policies that are sought to be 
carried out, I find it difficult, if not impossible, to answer, in terms of 
our .old principles and procedure, the objections that are urged. Never- 
theless, for a while, I feel constrained, by very force of all the circum- 
stances, to be patient for the outcome of these experimental policies. 

A FAIR TRIAL URGED 

I feel that constraint because, while I may have objections and 
criticisms, I have nothing constructive to offer in lieu of these poli- 
cies. I think that many a man who gives himself over to criti- 
cism of the program which is now being projected for the recovery 
of the nation will discover, when he frankly asks himself the question, 
what would he do instead, that he is without a substitute program. 

Now, I am not opposed to criticism of the right kind. I think that 
it is a very definite and a very essential part of the whole theory of a 
democracy, that there should be open opportunity for criticism. But 
I do think that in times of great stress, when the very nation itself is 
languishing for want of something constructive to lift itself out of 
unheard-of conditions, it behooves the citizens of our country to be 
patient, and to give to a program projected by our government a fair 
opportunity. After all, the best way to demonstrate the worthiness or 
the unworthiness of any policy is to give it a fair trial, and the quicker 
any projected policy may have a fair trial, the sooner will its adaptability 
be determined. 

I feel very much assured of one thing, and that is this : that unless 
we give to our government our united support, our patient support, we 
are going to be thrown into the throes of more confusion than that which 
we now suffer. 

SUBSCRIBE TO SPIRIT AND CONFORM TO REQUIREMENTS 

So I appeal for patience. Let us discover, by cooperation and 
support, what may come of these programs. For one, I do not doubt 
good intention as the premise. Many of the policies are fraught with 
innumerable difficulties. I have had experience enough to know that 
it is not an easy thing to revamp a business to conform with the require- 



ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 65 

merits of N. R. A. But I take it that the chief thing to be conserved, 
after all, is the spirit of the movement, and while there may be some 
technical difficulties encountered, by which an absolute compliance be- 
comes almost impossible, I take it that there is no one who cannot, if 
he will, subscribe to the spirit and conform as nearly as may be to the 
letter of the requirements. I don't have very much respect for the one 
who pretends to conform to this program, and secures the Blue Eagle 
to adorn his establishment to avoid stigma and criticism, and then ignores 
the provisions and the intent and the spirit of the Act. To my thinking, 
that is deceit unwarranted. 

Brethren and sisters of the Church, we cannot be Latter-day Saints 
without being honest, honest with ourselves, honest with our neighbors, 
honest with our country, honest with God. No manner of deception may 
be practiced by a man without robbing him of the fundamental spirit 
and genius of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. 

APPEALS FOR SUPPORT FOR LEADERS 

Now, I need not say more to indicate what I think should be the 
attitude of our people, as citizens of the Republic, toward the policies 
inaugurated by our government. It is true that we may entertain some 
different views, and we have the right to our opinion, the right to the 
expression of it, but in an emergency an army follows its commander. 
I submit to you as to whether or not we are in an emergency, and I appeal 
for support for our leaders in this great crisis. 

We of the Church believe in sustaining government. Wherever 
our people are located, they are admonished to support, not only the 
form of government under which they live, but those who preside over 
them, kings, rulers and potentates. It is a part of our creed. 

SUSTAINS GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES 

Not infrequently, of late, I have been asked by rather critical 
people: "Does the Church believe in the capitalistic system?" Some 
have thought that we ought to set ourselves against the established 
economic system of the country in which we live. My answer has 
always been : "The Church has no economic creed that it advocates for 
the country. It is true that it does have a conception of one that may 
be initiated in the fold of Christ, when preparation is made for it, but 
it sustains the governmental agencies that are set up where it exists, 
where its members reside." 

PLEADS FOR PATIENCE 

I think we need to be patient in other affairs. I believe we need to 
be patient with each other, as fellow members of the Church. We need 
to be patient with youth. We need to be patient end sympathetically 
suspend our judgment of others, unless perchance we are commissioned 
to judge and under that commission are obliged to exercise a delegated 
prerogative. We have been told to judge not, that we should not be 



66 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

judged. We have been told to forgive. We are taught the principle 
of repentance. We know that every one is frail. We know that we 
all commit sins, either of commission or omission. None of us stands 
perfect, and we need, as our President said in his opening remarks, to 
be forbearing and kindly disposed, and to see our own faults, and attempt 
to remedy them. 

I sum it up under the caption of "Patience," and I plead for that 
divine quality to be manifest in the hearts and attitudes and actions 
of the Saints. 

DEPARTED AUTHORITIES AND THEIR SUCCESSORS 

I cannot refrain from just one comment with reference to the good 
men who have passed from mortality since our last conference meeting, 
and those who have succeeded them. I loved Brother James E. Talmage. 
I sat next to him for seventeen years in the Council of the Twelve. 
I have been blessed many times by the extent of his knowledge. I have 
been inspired by his diligence and his labors. I feel that he has made 
an inestimable contribution to the advancement of God's work, and 
that Brother Brigham H. Roberts, too, has done a monumental work, 
especially in his defense of the faith, and in his voluminous writings 
for the cause. 

I feel sure that the right men have been chosen to succeed these 
men. I love Brother Callis. I have been in the mission field with him. 
I have seen the spirit that he carries with him in his work. I have 
wondered how the people of the Southern States, over whom he presided 
for so many years, can find another father to take his place. They have 
depended on him, accepted his advice and counsel, and were ever en- 
couraged by his wonderful discourses and his kindly treatment. 

THE DEVOTION AND TESTIMONY OF WILLARD RICHARDS 

Brother John H. Taylor is a boyhood friend of mine. I don't 
know whether I ought to say it or not, but I feel disposed to say that I 
have never been able to explain my own inclusion among the general 
authorities of the Church, except on the ground that my grandfather, 
Willard Richards, offered his life for this work. He was an intimate 
friend and associate of the Prophet. I know that he meant what he 
said when he offered to die for him. I know that he was true to him. 
I can think only that I came to the position that I now occupy because 
his good, loyal blood coursed in my own veins. 

My grandfather and Brother Taylor's grandfather were together 
in Carthage, with the Prophet and the Patriarch. I have felt very 
close to Brother John. I have felt that by inheritance we had a kinship, 
a comradeship, and I rejoice highly to know that I am now privileged to 
associate with him in the councils of the Church. 

I know that this is God's work. My grandfather knew it. He left 
his testimony to me of it, and I know that when he gave his record that 
Joseph was a true prophet, that he did not lie. The testimony that I 



ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 67 

have from him, sustaining the knowledge that has come into my heart, 
makes me to say : I know that Joseph is a prophet of the living God. 
I want to live worthy of his association. I should be gratified beyond 
measure if I could only come back into his presence and receive a word 
of commendation from him for my humble participation in the cause 
which he was instrumental in setting up. 

God bless you, my brethren and sisters, I pray, in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

I had the pleasure yesterday of bringing to the afternoon services 
of this conference Miss Thelma Cazalet of London. Miss Cazalet is a 
member of the English Parliament, and is in America studying the 
economic and social conditions of the country. It is gratifying to know 
that in her itinerary she included Salt Lake City. Upon her arrival 
here, she called on me and presented a letter of introduction from Mr. 
William Teeling, one of England's most prominent newspaper men. 
I had the pleasure of entertaining Mr. Teeling two years ago, and he 
seemed to have enjoyed seeing this marvelous building, and listening 
to its great organ. His letter to me concerning Miss Cazalet reads : 

"If you remember the time that I visited you in Salt Lake City, you will 
recall that we went to the Tabernacle ; and then you were kind enough to take 
me to meet President Grant and his counselors. I wonder if you will allow me 
to introduce to you Miss Thelma Cazalet of the British Parliament. Miss 
Cazalet is very much interested in the s'ocial life of the United States, and expects 
to go to Utah to find out Something about the Mormon people, how they interpret 
life, and what they are doing - for the social uplift of humanity through their 
marvelous organization. I would be very glad if you will call on Mr. Smoot, 
and have Miss Cazalet meet the distinguished senator, for she wishes to interview 
him on the economic conditions of America." 

The rest of the letter is personal, so I will not quote it. 

I had the pleasure of escorting Miss Cazalet about the city, and 
calling on Senator Smoot. I am very happy to tell you the gracious 
compliment Miss Cazalet paid Senator Smoot, for she said that the Eng- 
lish people and members of Parliament regard him as one of America's 
greatest citizens, and a man who more than any other American under- 
stands the economic and financial problems of the world. This gracious 
compliment paid the Senator I shall not forget; I appreciate it from 
the bottom of my heart. 

A great many tourists come to Utah, and pay high tribute to the 
work of our people. They see something here that is delivering man- 
kind from bondage, and bringing liberty. Such a revival is not the work 
of man, but the work of the Spirit of God. Miss Cazalet looked into 
your faces and noted your honesty; your sincerity of life. "There is 
something about the people here that is impressive," she remarked in 
words that to me were graciously given. 

Miss Cazalet is a friend of Susan Ertz, who also visited Utah 



68 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

something over a year ago. I had the pleasure of taking Miss Ertz about 
the city and bringing her to this building where she heard an organ 
recital. It was an impressive hour. Miss Ertz has written a great novel 
based on the trek of the Mormon pioneers to the far West. In her 
story the hardships and sorrows of the people are clearly portrayed; 
and she tells of the great truths of colonizing the West, and pays high 
tribute to the pioneers of this State. 

It is only recently that the noted Austrian writer, Walter Eidlitzs 
completed his two volume work entitled ZODIAC. I think the novel 
bids fair to obtain the Nobel prize for literature this year. Herr 
Eidlitz came to Utah from Vienna, Austria, because he had been told 
by one Ann Litisch that the Latter-day Saints seemed to have a power 
far beyond anything she had ever experienced in her life. Here Herr 
Eidlitz would be able to find the power and light that the world needs, 
namely, the priesthood of God. Herr Eidlitz was in our home for two 
weeks investigating the truths of the Gospel of Jesus Christ our Lord, 
and he was greatly impressed with our testimony that the holy priesthood 
of God had been restored to earth. 

I think that all people who accept the Gospel of our Lord are the 
intelligent ones of the world. It is true that we bring from Europe 
and other parts of the world the poor in material things, but not the 
poor in spiritual gifts. We have brought from Scandinavia, Germany, 
England, Italy, France, and other nations those who have humble faith 
in the Savior. It is only such who can understand the Gospel. They, 
like the Apostle Paul, find power in faith; a faith that produces and 
works itself out in a life of love. They learn like the rest of us that 
true faith gives all ; and in return receives all. This is what was meant 
by the Prophet Joseph Smith when he wrote these words which are 
found in the eighty-eighth section of the Doctrine and Covenants, a 
book which I wish we would read more in our homes : 

"For intelligence cleaveth unto intelligence ; wisdom receiveth wisdom ; truth 
embraceth truth ; virtue loveth virtue ; light cleaveth unto light ; mercy hath 
compassion on mercy and claimeth her own; justice continueth its course and 
claimeth its own; judgment goeth before the face of him who sitteth upon the 
throne and governeth and executeth all things 1 ." 

A few months ago I brought into this building Dr. Murai, one 
of the distinguished educators of Japan. He was greatly interested in 
the architectural beauties of the Tabernacle, and the radiancy of the 
interior. It all looked so beautiful that day. On his return to Japan, 
he wrote me some of his impressions as to what the Gospel means, and 
among the many good things he said were these : 

"To follow Jesus Christ means : First to be a child toward God. This is 
trust and faith in our Maker. We must be servants, and serve with spiritual 
grace and power our God. Then the next thing is to be sovereigns over ourselves, 
which means self-control. Think of thes'e words : Faith, Service, Self-control. 
What a lovely lesson ! Religion after all is a holy synthesis of all that is true 
and beautiful." 



ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 69 

I am thankful that this noble old building in which we are sitting 
this afternoon inspires such thoughts in the hearts of men. Through 
many channels of thought, I firmly believe that mankind is coming to 
a better understanding of life and its meaning ; I think the world is moving 
toward Christ. It was the prophet Malachi who wrote : 

"For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my 
name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense shall be 
offered unto my name, and a pure offering." 

Our call as members of the Church and as men holding the Priest- 
hood of God, is to go into all the world and preach the Gospel. It is 
a sacred thing given us to do. To be effective in this we must go forth 
with pure hearts and contrite spirits ; with an eye single to the glory of 
God. Our spirits must be clean : and with pure hearts, which will enable 
us to see and understand the ways of truth, we will become the standard 
bearers of that divine Will which ultimately will establish the glorious 
Kingdom of God on earth. So in the midst of this practical world, we 
shall have to exhibit a practical life of love : a busy life of helpfulness ; 
feeding the hungry, receiving the stranger, clothing the naked, visiting the 
sick and sorrowful. In this period of stress and tribulation, sorrow 
and pain, trouble and care, there is a deep and lasting lesson to be 
learned. It is the lesson that no one can live without God in his life. 
The Apostle Paul wrote to the Philippians : "Unto you it is given in the 
behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his 
sake." Be encouraged, my brethren and sisters. Your lives will be 
filled with greater visions and dreams ; your days will yet be golden. 
Remember what an apostle of old said to the Romans : 

"Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honor preferring 
one another; 

Not slothful in business ; fervent in Spirit ; serving the Lord ; 

Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer; 

Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality." 

When we have given heart and soul and life to God, we need not 
worry about the things that may happen tomorrow. The courage of 
faith will be our attitude of mind that will bring peace today. There 
is Light today in the world. It is a greater and more radiant light than 
ever before in all history. This light is the Truth of God as revealed 
by the Father. Remember what the first historian wrote in the Holy 
Scriptures : 

"In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth. 
And the earth was without form and void ; and darkness was on the face of 
the deep. And the Spirit of God moved on the face of the waters. 
And God said, Let there be light : and there was light." 

Then we are told in words that ring with the greatest and most 
divine truth of all : "God created man in his own image, in the image 
of God created he him." 



70 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

God bless us every one. May our love increase; may our fiaith in 
God deepen, I ask in Jesus name. Amen. 

The congregation sang the hymn, "Do what is right." 

ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 

First Counselor in the Presiding Bishopric 

Sunday, following the funeral service of President Roberts, I 
returned to my home hoping to find a subject I might use if called upon 
during this conference. Long ago I learned that when disturbed I 
might go to the Lord in the spirit of prayer, and receive comfort. Before 
leaving my room I had prepared some notes, for the purpose of re- 
freshing my memory. Yesterday morning, during the speech given 
by President Grant, I felt my notes perhaps would be useless. By the 
time he had finished his address to us I was convinced the Lord had 
heard and answered my prayer. 

The proceedings of this conference, thus far, have given me en- 
couragement. I shall read the notes I made at that time, for they are a 
witness to me that the Lord does hear and answer prayers. 

"Hearken, O ye people of my church, saith the voice of him who dwells on 
high, and whose eyes are upon all men ; yea, verily I say : Hearken ye people 
from afar ; and ye that are upon the islands of the sea, listen together. 

"For verily the voice of the Lord is unto all men, and there is none to escape ; 
and there is no eye that shall not see, neither ear that shall not hear, neither heart 
that shall not be penetrated. 

"And the rebellious shall be pierced with much sorrow; for their iniquities 
shall be spoken upon the house tops, and their secret acts shall be revealed. 

"And the voice of warning shall be unto all people, by the mouths of my 
disciples whom I have chosen in these last days. 

"And they shall go forth and none shall stay them, for I the Lord have 
commanded them. 

"Behold, this is mine authority, and the authority of my servants, and my 
preface unto the book of my commandments, which I have given them to publish 
unto you, O inhabitants of the earth. 

"Wherefore, fear and tremble, O ye people, for what I the Lord have decreed 
in them shall be fulfilled. 

"And verily I say unto you, that they who go forth, bearing these tidings unto 
the inhabitants of the earth, to them is power given to seal both on earth and in 
heaven, the unbelieving and rebellious; 

"Yea, verily, to seal them up unto the day when the wrath of God shall be 
poured out upon the wicked without measure — 

"Unto the day when the Lord shall come to recompense unto every man 
according to his work, and measure to every man according to the measure which 
he has measured to his fellow man. 

"Wherefore the voice of the Lord is unto the ends of the earth, that all that 
will hear may hear." (Doc. and Cov., Sec. 1) 

These are the words of the Lord given to his prophet Joseph Smith. 
It seems to me that conditions of the world are such today that this 
warning is timely and very appropriate. While the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints is increasing in numbers, both as to members, 



ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 71 

and participation in church activities provided for their spiritual and 
temporal welfare, there is yet much to be accomplished. From a care- 
ful study of the records it appears to me that there is a broad field for 
missionary work which now is being worked in only a haphazard manner, 
although we have the machinery set up the spiritual energy does not 
appear to be sufficient to cause it to operate to the fullest extent. 

Are we devoting our time to a study of the theories of men alone ? 
Theories of men may or may not be based upon truth. The revealed 
word of our Father is the truth and can be proven by each individual for 
himself. To obtain such truth one must so live that he comes in harmony 
with the principles of truth as laid down in the teachings of our Lord 
and Savior; this seldom comes through opposition thereto. One who 
makes a practice of profaning the name of Deity cannot approach him 
in the spirit of truth for he has said: "Thou shalt not take the name 
of the Lord thy God in vain ; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless 
that taketh his name in vain." That commandment is just as much in 
force today as when given and one who disregards it has not the spirit 
of truth. He who fails to remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy 
does not develop a spirit to which the Lord may reveal the truth. The 
Lord demands that we "Remember the Sabbath day, -to keep it holy. 
Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work, but the seventh day is the 
Sabbath of the Lord thy God ; in it thou shalt not do any work." This 
commandment has been repeated in this day in Section 59 of the Doc- 
trine and Covenants, which says further, "And that thou mayest more 
fully keep thyself unspotted from the world, thou shalt go to the house 
of prayer and offer up thy sacraments upon my holy day." 

Are our religious services such that all classes may be encouraged 
by them ? Do all who attend have the spirit of worship ? Are any 
inattentive ? What are we doing for those who make a practice of using 
church services as a visiting time? Are our socials orderly? Is there 
always some one with an understanding disposition on hand to encourage 
those who are inclined to rowdyism? To my mind attention to these 
things is of great importance to religious training, for they tend to 
belittle and make light of the spiritual. 

A careful examination of quorum and auxiliary records will if 
analyzed reveal a most interesting story, and unless those of us who have 
been called as leaders become thoroughly familiar with this story we shall 
naturally approach our labors in an inefficient manner. Are we holding 
our young men and moving them from one quorum to the next without 
loss ? Are they becoming more zealous in their work and more willing to 
serve as they approach new experiences? If so we may well rejoice in 
our labors ; if not, it is our duty to redouble our efforts and plead with 
our Father for wisdom and power to accomplish that end. Spirituality 
is not developed alone through the study of the revealed word ; there 
must be also a service through which the Gospel principles may be applied, 
creating in return that joy the Lord is pleased to bestow upon his children 
as a reward. These two, service, with a knowledge of the Gospel, will 
break down the power of the adversary and build in the one so fortified 



72 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

a resistance against evil and a power to understand the truth, for our 
Lord has said : "If ye contiue in my word, then are ye my disciples 
indeed ; And ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free." 
(John 8:31-32) 

To add to the activities of the Aaronic Priesthood we have been 
during the past few years developing work in genealogy. The work 
of the Genealogical Society is taking an important part in this con- 
ference. Their objective is to save our dead. I am sure that with proper 
planning on the part of Aaronic Priesthood supervisors those who hold 
this Priesthood can do much, not only to gather the records of their 
ancestors but also in doing work in their behalf, which will develop 
the spirit of this work. To know how to prepare records, to be baptized 
for his ancestors, and later perform other temple ordinances before 
leaving for the mission field would place each Elder in a position to 
render great assistance to those who live in the missions, by helping them 
to prepare their records, much of which, when completed, could with 
our help be done for them and cause them to feel contented to remain 
with their friends and neighbors where they may serve as missionaries 
also, for the missions are embraced in Zion, and young men at home 
preparing for such work will become a tower of strength to them and 
examples for good at home. Parents who are about to send your boys 
into the mission field do not be content with having them go through the 
temple only the few times they do so while at the mission home. Go 
with them before this time, help them to understand the full meaning 
and purpose of this work. This is not alone a privilege, but an obligation 
placed upon us. We read in the Doctrine and Covenants, Section 68 : 

"Inasmuch as parents have children in Zion, or in any of her stakes which 
are organized, that teach them not to understand the doctrine of repentance, faith 
in Christ the Son of the living God, and of baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost 
by the laying on of hands, when eight years eld, the sin be upon the heads of the 
parents. * * * 

"And their children shall be baptized for the remission of their sins when 
eight years old, and receive the laying on of the hands. 

"And they shall also teach their children to pray, and to walk uprightly before 
the Lord. 

"And the inhabitants of Zion shall also observe the Sabbath day to keep it holy. 

"And the inhabitants of Zicn also shall remember their labors, inasmuch as 
they are appointed to labor, in all faithfulness ; for the idler shall be had in re- 
membrance before the Lord. * * * 

"And a commandment I give unto them — that he that observeth not his prayers 
before the Lord in the season thereof, let him be had in remembrance before the 
judge of my people." 

It is extremely important that we shall provide for our dead that 
which they were unable to do for themselves, but what of those who 
were not worthy and who had that opportunity? We are given to 
understand that they must await the time of the Lord before they can 
enjoy the blessings promised. What of the boy growing to manhood 
who is neglected during this time when he so much needs encouragement 
through a contact with those who understand the Gospel and have a 



ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 73 

desire to use this knowledge to teach them in the spirit of love and truth ? 
What of the man who has been neglected, whose children are untrained 
because of his lack of knowledge, a condition existing generally not 
because he would have it so? Perhaps he too was neglected and has 
not the power within himself to regain that which he has lost. Is it 
not even more important that we save him and his household while he 
has the privilege of enjoying the promise of coming forth in the first 
resurrection ? Let us be mindful of the words of the apostles of old : 

"Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him; 

"Let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his 
way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins." (James 
5:19-20) 

"We are of God : he that knoweth God heareth us ; he that is not of God 
heareth not us. Hereby knoweth we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error. 

"Beloved, let us love one another : for love is of God ; and every one that 
loveth is born of God, and knoweth God." (I John 4:6-7) 

As an example of service I give you the following : The Tabernacle 
choir began to sing over a national radio network a little more than 
four years ago ; their program is now considered to be the outstanding 
radio program in the world. Why? Because they receive no other 
compensation for their work than the joy of service. There are 273 
members, they rehearse Thursday nights, sing over the Columbia broad- 
casting network each Sunday morning, and for the regular Church 
service Sunday afternoon each week. This requires them to make three 
trips to the tabernacle and three home each week, a personal outlay for 
each, of 50 cents a week for car fare. Their average attendance is 63.56 
per cent. Each Sunday they are heard from more than 80 stations with 
combined facilities valued in millions. The commercial value of each 
program period is about $10,000.00, and of the full period they have 
been on the air $2,500,000.00. Each Sunday they are heard not only in 
the United States but also in Europe where the program is relayed by 
short wave length, those living on the isles of the sea eagerly look forward 
to it. All this because of the devotion of these singers which finds ex- 
pression in their faithful attendance and in song and the sweet organ 
music mellowed by a divine providence. 

I quote from Doctrine and Covenants, Section 93, verses 21 to 28: 

"And now, verily I say unto you, I was in the beginning with the Father, and 
am the Firstborn ; 

"And all those who are begotten through me are partakers of the glory of the 
same, and are the church of the Firstborn. 

"Ye were also in the beginning with the Father ; that which is Spirit, even 
the Spirit of truth ; 

"And truth is knowledge of things as they are, and as they were, and as they 
are to come ; 

"And whatsoever is more or less than this is the spirit of that wicked one 
who was a liar from the beginning. 

"The Spirit of truth is of God. I am the Spirit of truth, and John bore 
record of me, saying : He received a fulness of truth, yea, even of all truth ; 

"And no man receiveth a fulness unless he keepeth his commandments. 



74 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

"He that keepeth his commandments receiveth truth and light, until he is 
glorified in truth and knoweth all things." 

If these words are true, and I sincerely believe with all the powers 
of my soul that they are, are' we not charged with a great responsibility ? 

May our Father help us to understand and live in obedience to his 
commandments I humbly pray. 

-ELDER JOHN V. BLUTH 

President of the Canadian Mission 

My brethren and sisters, when I heard Brother Grant say that some 
individual had sent a card, anonymously, asking that the Word of Wis- 
dom be not spoken of in this conference, I wondered whether that 
individual expected to be present, and whether or not present at each 
of these sessions. If so, he or she must have been surprised at the 
wonderful success that card had in bringing exactly the opposite results. 

Most of the speakers have dwelt upon the principle of temperance, 
and the problem before the people at the present time. I want to indorse 
the remarks of Brother Ballard, relative to how the missionaries feel 
in the world, or at least in that part of the world to which I have been 
assigned, the Canadian Mission ; what anxiety they feel as to how Utah 
will stand upon this question that comes before them shortly — the repeal 
of the prohibition amendment. 

They have traveled there and taught the people that this Gospel is 
different from theirs; that it has life and vitality in it; that it changes 
the lives of its adherents, makes them better, gives them newer ideas; 
that they live the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Now, they wonder, as they 
walk the paths, the lanes, and the highways, preaching the Gospel, 
as to what the result will be should Utah follow the majority who have 
thus far expressed themselves, the history that she will make. They 
feel that though Utah be the only state in the Union that votes against 
the repeal, they can hold their heads high and say: "We have been 
vindicated ; the Latter-day Saints have been taught the Gospel, and 
whatever there may be of theory or idea as to why they ought to be 
better off with repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment than they are with 
that amendment in the Constitution, they have at least shown their faith 
by their works." They feel if otherwise, the people will say: "You have 
told us that you have a gospel different from all else that exists in the 
world ; that it has a revitalizing effect upon your people. Now explain 
Utah's vote." Utah, we are told, is sixty per cent Mormon, and forty 
per cent non-Mormon; and out of that non-Mormon membership there 
are many in the Christian denominations and churches who are working 
hard and diligently against a repeal. If Utah then votes for repeal, it 
means that thousands of the Latter-day Saints have forsaken that which 
they have been taught, and have been led away by error. 

Brother Joseph Fielding Smith overheard a remark about which 
he spoke, to some extent. I also overheard one by a church worker 



ELDER JOHN V. BLUTH 75 

who felt that he had to vote "wet," or for the repeal, because it meant 
more revenue to us. I wondered where in the world that revenue is 
going to come from, except out of the pockets of the people who will 
then be led to indulge in the things that they have refrained from here- 
tofore. Every dollar they spend for liquor goes first to pay for the rent 
of the saloon, for the purchase of the fixtures the saloon-keeper has to 
have, for the purchase of the merchandise he expects to dispense there, 
for the home that he builds for his family, for the luxuries that he gives 
unto them, for the car, the radio, and other things, to pay the tax 
upon his property, to pay the taxes upon the saloon property, and to 
give him something to lay by for a rainy day; and if there is any part 
left, that goes to revenue. How much ? Possibly a dime on a dollar ; 
I doubt if that much. Oh, is it necessary to put a dollar through the 
hands of the saloon-keeper in order to get a dime back in revenue, and 
while we get that dime back debauch the manhood of the nation? That 
is the question as it appeals to me. 

The missionaries feel that they want to be able to say that Utah 
has shown, by its attitude, that it lives what it preaches. 

The song at the opening of the session here this afternoon was : 

"We thank thee, O God, for a prophet, 

To guide us in these latter days ; 
We thank thee for sending the Gospel, 

To lighten our minds with its rays. 
We thank thee for every blessing, 

Bestowed by thy bounteous hand. 
We feel it a pleasure to serve thee, 

And love to obey thy command." 

I feel if we who have sung that this afternoon really mean what we have 
sung, then we can count upon all of us to do that which is right in this 
matter, and as missionaries bring as many more to the same attitude of 
mind. Our prophet has spoken; counsel has been given. Years past 
have proven to us the wisdom of abiding by the counsels given unto us. 
Why not learn by experience already had, rather than the lamentable 
experience that is bound to come to us otherwise? 

I bring you greetings from the brethren and sisters in the Canadian 
Mission. They are not many, but they are determined ; they are full of 
the Spirit of the Lord. We love them for their integrity, their desire to 
serve, their willingness to devote as much time as can possibly be given 
in every day of every week, during their service, in bringing the Gospel 
to as many people as possible, in any way that they can conceive of. We 
need more missionaries. We have had to abandon or withdraw our 
missionaries from four districts, and to concentrate a little more, pending 
the arrival of more missionaries. But we feel that we are doing the 
work of the Lord, that his blessings attend us, and that there is a finer 
spirit than there has been for some time, and that spirit is creeping 
into the branches of the Church. Much of the discord and disunion that 
has been exhibited heretofore has been dissipated. The people have 
learned more of the philosophy of the Gospel, what it means to love 



76 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

and to forgive and to overlook. They have learned something of the 
difference between discord and union, and what the results of those 
two will be. They are coming nearer unto the Lord. They are putting 
up a little with one another's faults where they criticised before. 

Our baptisms have increased considerably over those of the entire 
past year, and there are quite a number of prospects who show an interest 
in the Gospel, a genuine interest, because of the principles taught. We 
feel to rejoice in the work of the Lord in that mission. It may be the 
gleaning time for we get them, one out of a city and another out of a 
county, here and there, but they are souls, children of God, and should 
be found. 

We rejoice in the work we have been given to do, and we pray God's 
blessing, not only upon the work in our mission, but upon the fields 
throughout the entire world. May the Lord so bless us that fi- 
nance and means may come unto us, and that the spirit of sacrifice 
may enter our souls, that we may send more of our people into the 
field ; and may he open up the places where so far the Gospel has 
not yet been permitted to come, and that the people may be willing to 
receive it. Then we may find another harvest time. 

God bless you all, my brethren and sisters, and may he help us 
to be faithful unto the end, and, having entered into the fold through 
baptism, not be content to sit down by the gate where we entered, and 
say: "We are saved," as they do in the world, but recognize the fact 
that our whole journey still lies before us, and if we expect to reach 
the destination we must continue to plod on in faithfulness, in activity 
and in service, and learn more about God's commandments, and about 
living them. 

God bless you, is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER ARTHUR WELLING 

President North Central States Mission 

Though feeling my weakness very keenly, my brethren and sisters, 
in filling this important position, I am nevertheless glad to join in the 
spirit of this wonderful conference, and briefly to report conditions in 
the North Central States Mission. 

Listening to the clarion call of our President and others who have 
spoken in this Conference, I have thought of the question of Paul to 
the Corinthians: "If the trumpet shall give an uncertain sound, 
who shall prepare himself to the battle?" (I Cor. 14:8). Obviously, 
the answer to the question is, "nobody ;" which, I believe explains in part 
the confusion that is found in the religious thinking of the world. There 
is in its leadership no authoritative, "Thus saith the Lord." 

Whatever else may be thought of "Mormonism," its trumpet call 
to the world is no uncertain sound. Just think : The Father and the 
Son themselves, in the sacred grove, announcing Divine disapproval of 
conditions as they were, and proclaiming a restoration of the Gospel; 



ELDER ARTHUR WELLING 77 

Moroni, a great Prophet of this hemisphere, restoring the scripture and 
record of his people, The Book of Mormon ; John the Baptist, conferring 
the Aaronic priesthood ; Peter, James, and John, the Melchizedek priest- 
hood ; Moses, Elias, and Elijah, restoring the keys of their great calling, 
with all that that implies. 

And now, today and yesterday, and at every such conference of 
the Church, the voice of the Lord unmistakably, through his chosen 
leaders, presenting clear, emphatic, and authoritative trumpet calls to 
the world, "repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." 

So I am glad to be here, to find myself in harmony with all that has 
been said and done at this marvelous Conference, and to carry back 
the message of it to the people among whom it is my privilege and honor 
to serve. 

In the North Central States Mission we have only one-third as 
many missionaries as formerly, but we are trying to carry on and to 
make up this deficiency in three ways: First, by increased activity on 
the part of the few missionaries who remain: Secondly, by extension 
of our special or local missionary service: Thirdly, by the greater use 
of our branches and of the auxiliaries of the Church as missionary 
agencies and centers of missionary activity. 

To illustrate : only last week, in a far corner of the mission, I met 
with a newly organized Mutual Improvement Association. Forty-three 
people were present. Three of us were missionaries. Five others, 
constituting the leadership of the group, were local members ; and thirty- 
five were friends and investigators who had come out to participate in 
the benefits and blessings of that particular auxiliary. And so it is 
elsewhere throughout the mission. 

In the far northwestern corner of our mission, not many weeks 
ago, four hundred miles above the border at Beaver Crossing near Cold 
Lake, we held a baptism, blessed a few babies, and organized what I 
suppose is the northernmost branch of the Church in Canada. This 
little pioneer community faces the necessity, at once, of building for 
themselves a chapel from the timber growing on their homesteads ; and 
our hope and prayer is that the Lord will bless them, and that the Gospel 
may 'be carried to the various corners of our mission with such agencies 
as remain. 

Opportunities abound for preaching the Gospel, for which we are 
grateful ; and sentiment favorable to our Church and people is growing. 
Concerning our missionaries, we are pleased to report that the young 
men and women who come to us are "the salt of the earth." Every 
one of them is well, and busy, and happy in his or her work, and the 
Lord is blessing their efforts and magnifying them in the eyes of the 
people. 

Our testimony is that God lives, that this is his Church and King- 
dom; and that it will stand forever; and "we are all enlisted till the 
conflict is o'er." 

To which humble testimony and report may the Lord add his 
blessings, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



78 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

ELDER HYRUM D. JENSEN 

Former President of the Norwegian Mission 

My brethren and sisters, words cannot express the joy and satis- 
faction that I have today in being present in our General Conference. 
It has now been five years since I had the privilege of meeting here, 
listening to the counsel of the servants of the Lord. 

I have been absent in the Norwegian Mission for four and a half 
years, and I must say that we have been under the leadership, in Europe, 
of one of the most wonderful men I have ever met, President John A. 
Widtsoe. I am very thankful that I had the privilege of going into 
the European Mission while President Widtsoe was taking charge of that 
mission. He has been a father to us mission presidents. He has been a 
father to the missionaries — a man whom we could always depend on for 
counsel and instruction. 

But we have missed the counsel and instructions that you receive 
here twice a year, and as I stated, I have not words to express my joy 
in having had the privilege of hearing the voice, the instructions and 
the counsel that we received yesterday from our beloved President, 
Heber J. Grant, and from the others who have spoken yesterday and 
today. 

I bring you greetings from the Norwegian Mission, from the elders 
and the Saints. There are only a few missionaries. We haven't had as 
many as we wish we could have had. I sometimes have said that I was 
sorry I was called to go to the Norwegian Mission just before the 
depression came. But when I look back upon the work that has been 
performed there, I feel that the depression has been a blessing to us. 
While it has deprived us of the missionaries from home, it has com- 
pelled the Saints to be more faithful and more energetic in the work. 
Every branch in the Norwegian Mission today is thoroughly organized 
and in the hands of local people. We have no missionaries that are 
concerned in any way with the branches. 

We have all the organizations that you have here at home. While 
we haven't them as perfectly organized, perhaps, as you have here, they 
are working toward perfection. Our Relief Society is doing a wonderful 
work: I don't know what I would have been able to do in the mission 
if it hadn't been for the good, faithful sisters of the Relief Society. 
Where we had no Priesthood or male members in the branches or in 
the cities, these faithful sisters have carried on the Relief Society work, 
and are doing it today. 

Our Sunday Schools are fully organized and doing a wonderful 
work. We have nearly as many children enrolled in our Sunday Schools 
who do not belong to the Church as we have who belong to the Church. 

Our Mutual Improvement Associations are all in the hands of local 
people, and are performing a wonderful work among the young people. 

We have the Primary Organization, which is just in its infancy, 
but the sisters who have charge of it are working hard and faithfully 



ELDER HYRUM D. JENSEN 79 

to make it a success throughout the mission. There are many more 
children who belong to or are attending the Primary Association who 
do not belong to the Church than there are children who are members 
of the Church. iWe are holding in the homes of the Saints and in the 
homes of our friends, who will open up their houses for that purpose, 
Primaries in different parts of the city. Eight to ten or twelve children 
at a time are gathered together and are instructed in the principles of the 
Gospel. We have been following out to the letter the instructions that 
we have received, and the lessons that have been sent to us through the 
Children's Friend. 

We have the Genealogical organizations organized throughout the 
mission, and they are now doing a splendid work. The Saints are be- 
coming interested in the gathering of their genealogy, and I look for the 
time to come when we shall receive from that land a great many names 
of people for whom the Saints here in Zion may do work in the temples. 

I can join with the other mission presidents in stating that the 
young men who have been sent to the Norwegian Mission during my 
presidency are the choicest young men I have ever had the privilege of 
laboring with. We have only ten missionaries at present in the mission 
to do the work that was formerly done by twenty missionaries. 

In closing, I will state that my first mission to Norway was thirty- 
nine years ago. I found conditions very much different at that time 
from what they are now. My second mission was in 1911, 1912, and 
1913. I came home in the fall of 1913, and went back to take charge 
of the mission in 1929. I found that there was great opposition to us dur- 
ing my earlier missions. We had some difficulty in getting missionaries 
into the country when we received seven missionaries at one time. The 
government officials asked what we were trying to do. For a time it 
seemed that we might have to write home and ask that so many be 
not sent at one time ; but conditions have changed. We could use today 
as many missionaries as the Church is able to send to the Norwegian 
Mission. The people are hungry for the Gospel. They are praying 
to God that men will come to them with the truth. They are searching 
for the truth. 

These ten missionaries were holding seven open-air meetings a 
week during the summer months, and we figured that we were having 
an attendance at these open-air meetings of between two thousand and 
twenty-five hundred people, who came out regularly upon the market 
places and in the parks to hear the Gospel explained by the missionaries. 
When I bade the people farewell on the main public square in the city 
of Oslo, and told them that I was going to return home, perhaps a 
hundred people came forward out of the audience of about four hundred 
and fifty people, and bade me farewell, wishing me joy in the future, and 
thanking me for the enlightenment that they had received through our 
meetings upon the public market places of Oslo. 

My brethren and sisters, I know that God lives. I know that Jesus 
is the Christ. I know that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God. I thought 
I had a testimony of the Gospel, a living testimony, before I went upon 



80 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

this last mission, but through the inspiration of God that has attended 
me in my labors while I was there, and my dear wife, and the good 
missionaries with whom I have had the privilege of laboring, there 
has come to me a testimony, and I hope the Lord will never permit me 
to do anything that will deprive me of it, because it is the only thing 
that brings joy and satisfaction to me. 

I plead with the Norwegian people — you of Norwegian descent 
— to do more towards teaching your children, your young men, the 
Norwegian language, so that when they go into the mission field they 
will be better prepared to preach the Gospel, because it is resting upon 
our shoulders, those who have Norwegian blood running in their veins, 
to warn that nation, and to give them the Gospel. May we do it, is my 
prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

THIRD DAY 
MORNING MEETING 

Sunday morning, October 8. 

Every seat and available space in the great Tabernacle auditorium 
and galleries was occupied before 9:30 o'clock. The large Assembly 
Hall on the Temple Block was crowded with people who could not find 
accommodation in the Tabernacle, and hundreds of others assembled on 
the Tabernacle grounds, where they listened to the proceedings as they 
were broadcast by radio. 

As a prelude to the fifth session of the Conference the following 
program of choral and organ music was rendered by the Tabernacle 
Choir and Organ, from 9 :30 to 10 :30, and broadcast by radio from coast 
to coast over the Columbia Broadcasting System, originating over 
Station KSL: 

"Awake" (Wagner) — Choir. 

"I'll sing thee songs" (Clay) — Organ. 

"Arise, glorious Zion" (Careless) — Choir.

accompaniments and organ solo presentations were played by Frank 
Asper. 

Following the Choir and Organ broadcast President Heber J. Grant 
announced that the Choir and the congregation would join in singing the 
hymn "Praise to the man who communed with Jehovah." 

After the singing of this hymn, the opening prayer was offered by 
Elder Joseph J. Daynes, President of the Grant Stake. 

PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVilNS 

First Counselor in the First Presidency 

My brethren and sisters, I desire to express the gratitude which I 
feel that I am permitted to meet again in a general conference of the 
Church. I have not been well, but through the blessing of the Lord 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. WINS 83 

I have not been seriously sick. I thank him and praise his name for 
this privilege. 

I love to be here at these gatherings of members of the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I love to listen to the voices of my 
brethren who are called upon to address you. It is one of the joys of 
my life. 

Naturally, knowing that I might be asked to make remarks at this 
conference, I have thought of something to say. I knew the message 
that I wished to deliver, but was at a loss to find words with which to 
properly express it. Elder Joseph Fielding Smith, in his remarks, sup- 
plied me with a text. He quoted from the words of the Prophet Ezekiel, 
words which, notwithstanding the centuries which have passed since they 
were uttered, are as applicable to us today as they were when the Lord 
uttered them to him. It was an admonition to him personally. 

HAD TURNED TO IDOLS 

The Israelitish people had turned from the faith of their fathers 
to the worship of idols. The Lord called Ezekiel, the son of Buzi, to 
go to them and proclaim his word, and he tells us that he went to those 
who dwelt upon the river Chebar, and abode with them for seven days. 
He marvelled at their wickedness, at their lack of faith, and hesitated 
to declare the message which the Lord had sent him to deliver. It was 
at this time that the Lord called his attention to the fact that when he 
required at the hands of a man the accomplishment of a work, when he 
sent him to call the wicked people to repentance, and he failed to deliver 
that message, and the wicked died in their sins, he might be held responsi- 
ble for it. But he also said to him that if he complied with the commands 
of God our father, and warned the wicked man of his ways, then if the 
man died in wickedness, he had complied with his duty and would not 
be held responsible. He called his attention to the fact that he had 
made him a watchman upon the towers of Zion, a man through whom he 
might properly send his word to unbelieving people. 

DUTY TO MAGNIFY IDEALS 

I have often read this scripture, have studied it carefully, and 
endeavored to understand its import and application. I have asked myself 
this question : What application has this command of the Lord to you ? 
The answer that has come to me has always been the same. It is this : 
that whatever my profession, whether it be as a citizen of the government 
to which I have given my allegiance or a member of the Church with 
which I affiliate, it becomes my duty to magnify in my life the ideals for 
which my country stands and the doctrines which my Church teaches. 

If I fail in either, and by example or precept lead other people 
away from loyalty to their country or to indifference and lack of attention 
to religious duties, I have 'in a sense become responsible, and I never 
feel this responsibility more than when I stand before a congregation 
of Latter-day Saints in the attitude of teacher, for the Lord expects men 



84 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

and women who accept responsibility to magnify it, otherwise they will 
be in judgment. 

a prophet's calling 

This particular scripture which was quoted called my special atten- 
tion to prophecy, the inspired word of God our Father, which is uttered 
by his servants the prophets, modern and ancient. I thought of its 
importance, of its application to us, and so sat down and outlined some 
of the results of prophecy in which we modern people are particularly 
interested. 

The word, prophet, defined in the Hebrew language, means one who 
has been called to denounce sin and foretell the consequences and 
punishment of it. He is to be above all else a preacher of righteousness, 
to call the people back from idolatry, to faith in the living God, and 
when moved upon by the Spirit of the Lord to foretell coming events. 
But more particularly a prophet is to be an expounder of present duties 
and an interpreter of the meaning and application of the written word. 

PROPHECIES BEING FULFILLED 

We at the present day have an entirely different relationship to 
prophecy than had those who lived at the time that many of the most 
important of the prophecies made were uttered. People of Bible days 
looked hopefully and in faith forward to the fulfilment of the words 
of the prophets. 

We look backward and see that many, very many of those important 
predictions have been fulfilled. We know if we study them carefully 
that we are living at a time when they are being fulfilled and that we are 
the actors in their fulfilment, whether we are conscious of it or not, and 
we know further, if we are to judge by the signs of the times which have 
been given to us by the prophets, and Christ himself, that we are upon the 
very verge of the fulfilment of the most important of them all, when 
God our father will consummate his work, when Christ our Lord shall 
come to rule and assume dominion over the kingdoms of this world. 

COVENANT WITH ABRAHAM 

It was four thousand years ago that the Lord called Abraham from 
Ur of the Chaldees, and brought him up into Palestine to a country 
and people who were alien to his own race, and entered into a new 
covenant with him. This man was ninety years of age and was childless, 
yet the Lord told him to look over all the land of Palestine, from north 
to south and from east to west and promised that he would give this 
land to his posterity who he declared would become, by comparison, as 
numerous as the sands upon the seashore or the stars of heaven. 

It was not until one thousand years later that this prediction, this 
covenant of the Lord, was fulfilled. When -1 David, the shepherd king, 
led the armies of Israel, subdued the last Jebusite defenders of the city 
of Jerusalem, and established his capital city at that place, was the word 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 85 

of the Lord fulfilled. Israel did become at that time one of the dominant 
and most influential kingdoms of the known world. 

A LAND OF PROMISE 

We, my brethren and sisters, are assembled here today in this 
historic building, in a city which we call Salt Lake, in a territory which 
we call Utah, a territory which forms one of the forty-eight federated 
states of our union, each state independent in its own sphere, but all 
bound together by constitutional law, which welds them into a single 
entity. 

Only yesterday the ground upon which this building stands, in fact 
the entire area covered by the United States of America, was an un- 
cultivated wilderness. The prophets of the Lord, centuries before, had 
predicted the existence of this land, before it was known to the people 
of the old world. They had outlined to us the establishment of this 
government of ours ; they had declared that upon this land, which to 
them was a land choice above all others, there would be established 
a system of civil government, which would be a light to the world; a 
government to which would be gathered the remnant of the scattered 
house of Israel; a government in which men would enjoy equal rights 
under the law; a government in which men would act as their own 
conscience might prompt them to do — with this restriction, however, 
that in that which they did they must not infringe upon the rights of others 
or prevent them from exercising the agency which they themselves 
exercised. 

The prophet Isaiah, referring to this land of America, these ever- 
lasting hills, declared that at a future time — the time to which he 
referred was the latter days — the house of the Lord would be established 
here, and that all nations would flow unto it ; that they would be taught 
here the way of the Lord and learn to walk in his paths. By foreknowl- 
edge of God the prophets declared that by the direction of his Spirit 
the Lord would bring people to this continent who would establish this 
form of government, and said that they would never be overthrown or 
conquered by other nations, if they would but serve the God of the land, 
who is Jesus Christ. 

The destiny of America from the day that Columbus sailed from 
the ports of Spain to the present, was declared by the prophets of the 
Lord, as I have said, before the people of Europe knew that America 
existed. The sailing of Columbus, from the port of Palos, in Spain, 
was not a thing of chance. It had been declared by the prophets nearly 
two thousand years before that the Spirit of the Lord would rest upon 
a man among the Gentiles, and that he would sail forth and land upon 
this continent. As he sailed on and on over uncharted seas, his crew 
was in open revolt, they declared that they would go no farther, and that 
upon the morrow they would turn the prows of their ships back to the 
east and endeavor to find their way back to Spain, but upon that eventful 
night a gun from the Pinta announced that land had been sighted. A 
new world had been discovered. 



S6 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

COMING OF PILGRIMS 

Two hundred years after the landing of Columbus another landing 
occurred which had been just as definitely declared by the prophets of 
God. When the Pilgrim Fathers anchored their ships off Plymouth 
Rock, another prophecy had been fulfilled and the history of the 
American nation had been commenced. Both of these events had been 
declared, according to the dates I have been able to discover, two thou- 
sand years before their final accomplishment. 

INDEPENDENCE DECLARED 

For more than a century the colonists who had come from the 
Old World continued to live under the governments of the countries 
from which they came. At the end of that time, and this too in fulfil- 
ment of the decrees of the prophets, they declared that they of right 
were and should be an independent people. 

The Declaration of Independence was published to the world, the 
War of Independence was fought and won, and our ship of state was 
launched on a troubled sea. The hour had struck that kingcraft and 
priestcraft, which for ages had held the struggling masses of the world 
in thralldom, under perverted control both in civil and religious life, were 
to be stricken and the people of the world were to be emancipated from 
the shackles with which they had been bound. 

CHURCH FOUNDED 

A half century had elapsed since the establishment of our govern- 
ment when another event of transcendent importance to the world oc- 
curred. The events that I have so briefly and imperfectly outlined up 
to the present were simply the foreordained and divine accomplishments 
that were to occur for the accomplishment of a divine purpose. Our 
Lord taught his apostles that though his life might be taken by his enemies, 
though the kingdom which he would have established might be destroyed 
by men, yet would he live on and come again to assume control and 
dominion over the earth. When they asked him when this would be — 
"give us a sign," they pleaded, "by which we may know the time of your 
coming and the establishment of your kingdom," — he outlined the things 
which would occur in the world, things which we are passing through 
today, as plainly as though he had seen them, and definitely declared 
that this gospel of the kingdom should be restored and preached in all 
the world as a witness. 

That promise, my brethren and sisters, was fulfilled eighteen hun- 
dred years later when, through the ministry of Christ our Lord and 
under his direction, the opening of the present gospel dispensation was 
effected through Joseph Smith and those who were associated with him. 

Washington's influence 

Immediately after the surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown, trouble, 
as serious as any which our government has since experienced, occurred. 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. WINS 87 

The army was about to be disbanded, there was no money with which 
to pay the soldiers for the years of devoted service which they had 
rendered their country. It was proposed that Washington be declared 
king and that the confederation of states be dissolved. Others de- 
nounced Washington as the person responsible for all of the trouble with 
which they were threatened. The army threatened to march upon the 
Congress and enforce its demands, and for fear that this might be 
accomplished, Congress adjourned and moved its place of meeting from 
Philadelphia to Princeton in New Jersey. 

"While these plotters were assembled," Fiske says (I have copied 
this from his writings, and now quote) : "Washington suddenly came 
into the meeting and amid profound silence broke forth in a most 
eloquent and profound speech. All," he says, "were hushed by that 
majestic presence and those solemn tones. He pleaded for patience," 
as Elder Richards pleaded for it here yesterday, for tolerance, "for 
trust in the newly born government which would in the end pay that 
which it owed. The soldiers listened, hesitated and yielded to the ir- 
repressible presence of the man who, more than any other, had made 
the establishment of our nation possible." 

OVERCOMING PROBLEMS 

From that time to the present our country has met and solved many 
grave problems, it has had wars and emerged victorious from them. It 
has had financial depressions, many of them, but notwithstanding this 
trouble, it has gone on. I might go on and quote part of the notes I 
have here, from the war of the rebellion, when fratricidal war shook 
the foundations upon which the government was established down until 
the present time. From all of these we have emerged stronger, more 
influential, more powerful, until today the United States of America 
has become the most influential and perhaps the wealthiest nation in 
the world. 

PRESENT PERPLEXITIES 

At the same time, paradoxical though the statement may appear to 
you, in the midst of all its wealth, surrounded by the abundance which 
the Lord has showered upon us, we know that millions of our fellow 
citizens are in dire need for the common necessities of life. Every 
citizen who is familiar with existing conditions in our country knows 
that embarrassing situations and complex questions confront us at the 
present time. 

They are not only perplexing to the national government, but to the 
various states which constitute the Union, the counties which constitute 
the states, and the municipalities which constitute the counties ; and to 
a greater or less extent, my brethren and sisters, they affect every 
individual of the commonwealth, as you who hear my voice well know 
from your own experience. 

Three things have conspired during the past decade which more 
than any others although there have been many ramifications from them, 



88 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

have created the present unfortunate situation. They are, as I analyze 
them, the following: 

First, the unprecedented disposition among the citizens of our 
country to treat with indifference the obligation of obedience to civil 
law, and the indifference manifested by administrative officers in the 
administration of it. 

Second, the frenzied desire of selfish men to become suddenly 
wealthy regardless of the ethics of the means employed to accomplish 
their ambitious and unrighteous desires. 

Third, the increasing indifference of our people to the sacredness 
of religious obligation. 

SHOULD OBEY LAWS 

The revelations given for the guidance of the Church tell us 
definitely that governments are instituted of God for the benefit of man, 
and admonish us to be obedient to the civil law in the countries in which 
we reside ; that it is the right of all men to act in both private and public 
affairs as their conscience may direct, but, as I have stated, with the 
limitation that they are not to infringe upon the privileges and rights 
of others. 

The Lord says — and this is quoted from a revelation : 

"And for this purpose have I established the Constitution of this land by 
the hands of wise men, whom I raised up for this very purpose, and redeemed 
the land by the shedding of blood." 

OPPOSITION OF LUCIFER 

If this government was established by God our Father, no argument 
should be necessary to convince you that anti-Christ is opposed to it. 
Lucifer is the enemy of God and Christ his Son. His minions have 
always been arrayed against them. He fights to lead men away from 
the Redeemer of the world. Never have his emissaries been more 
active than at the present time. The very elements appear to combine 
to bring confusion and tribulation to the people of this troubled world of 
ours. Both physical and spiritual forces are at work to effect and 
accomplish if possible our ruin. 

Shall Christ or Lucifer triumph in this conflict? This government 
of ours and all other governments need the strength of the Church. It 
was by Christian people under God that our government was founded 
and has been maintained. I have faith in the soul of the American 
people. They may stumble, they may waver, wicked men may for a 
time seize control of the affairs of government, but even though con- 
fronted by chaos, these people whom the Lord has brought here will rise 
in their might and with the help of God will triumph. 

INFLUENCE OF THE CHURCH 

Just as the government has had its difficulties, has had its trials, 
has been at times almost upon the verge of destruction, so has the 
Church since its organization. Its members have been driven, they 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W, IVINS 89 

have been persecuted, they have been misunderstood, and like Saul of 
Tarsus, under the impression that they were doing God service, men 
have endeavored to destroy its influence. Notwithstanding its drivings, 
notwithstanding the suffering of its people, like the government of which 
we form a part, the Church has become stronger, more powerful in 
influence and better than ever before, I believe, in its history, and I say 
the word better believing it to be true. 

PLEADS FOR LOYALTY 

I appeal to you, my brethren and sisters, and to all others who 
are under the sound of my voice, or to whom my words may come, 
to remain firm and immovable in life or death to the principles upon 
which this government of ours is founded. In its sphere it occupies 
the same relationship to our Father in heaven that the Church does. 
He is clearly the author of both, each to act in its own sphere — the 
government for the temporal protection and welfare of mankind, and 
the Church for their spiritual salvation. 

And so I feel impressed to call upon my brethren and sisters to 
support and magnify and do their duty to both the State and the Church. 
We need the sympathetic support of government wherever we are. 
You mission presidents who go into the field to proclaim the glad 
tidings of the restoration, my first act would be to get in harmony with 
the civil officers of the country in which I labored. 

We are frequently oppressed because people do not understand 
us, they do not know our mission, and that in many instances is because 
we have never endeavored to impress upon the minds of governing 
officers the real mission which we come to deliver. So I say we require 
the sympathetic support of the civil law. Without it Lucifer will sweep 
truth from the earth as he did in the primitive church and substitute in 
its stead the worship of idols. 

I want to say to you men of the Church who may be present or 
those who are absent and may hear my words, you doctors, lawyers, 
bankers and merchants, you men who because of your busy lives have 
forgotten perhaps the full sense of responsibility to the Church of which 
you form a part, to return to it, renew your affiliation with it. The 
Church needs you, it needs your intelligence, it needs your learning, 
your wisdom, as you need the strength which only the Church can afford. 
Your fathers, many of them, laid down their lives in its establishment. 
Come back to it and help us in this time of stress. 

I am sure that with this combined strength, my brethren and sisters, 
the proper union of the Church with the State, and the proper union 
of the State with the Church, we shall triumph. Without it our heritage 
may pass into the alien hands of a godless, idolatrous people. There 
is real fear of that except we faithfully do our duty, both to this 
government of ours, the best there is in the world, with all its weaknesses, 
the government established by God our Father. I pledge myself to be 
obedient to its laws. I have always been, and to the men who have 



90 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

administered its affairs, notwithstanding the fact that they may have 
weaknesses. 

God bless you, my brethren and sisters, keep us in the faith. Do 
not falter. The daydawn is breaking, when Christ our Lord shall come, 
not only to assume dominion over his Church, of which we form a part, 
but over the world at large. It was by church people — do not forget — ■ 
that this government was founded and the foundations of it were laid. 
It was by church people that the War of Independence was fought. It 
has been by church people that it has been maintained, and it will be by 
church people that it shall be rescued from chaos, if it is rescued at all. 
God bless you. Amen. 

A vocal solo, "O rest in the Lord," was sung by Mrs. C. G. VanOs. 

ELDER JOHN WELLS 

Second Counselor in the Presiding Bishopric 

My brethren and sisters, I sense deeply the responsibility that comes 
to any person who is called to express his thoughts to this large con- 
gregation. 

This morning's session has been an inspiration to me. The program 
presented by the tabernacle choir has subdued my spirit, so much so 
that I feel the influence of this meeting more, it seems to me, than I have 
at any other time. I am thankful to be here, thankful that I am a 
Latter-day Saint, thankful that I have the privilege of mingling my voice 
in song and praise and prayer in this conference. 

Let me first express my deep appreciation for my brethren who 
have passed away, Brother Brigham H. Roberts and Brother James 
E. Talmage. I became acquainted with Brother Roberts sometime in 
the year 1886, in England. He was then but thirty years of age. I 
admired him. He taught the Gospel to me as no other person had done 
previously. It was my privilege to sing for him as he preached the 
Gospel in the neighborhood where I lived. The second Sunday after I 
arrived in Salt Lake I heard Brother Talmage preach in the old 19th 
Ward chapel, and that sermon I shall always remember. His subject 
was : "Thou Shalt Have No Other Gods Before Me." Since the year 
1889 we have been close friends. I miss both of these brethren. 

I was glad that Aunt Susa Young Gates was remembered among 
those who have passed away since our last conference. She was my 
neighbor. Sister Gates was devoted to her religion. She had a wonder- 
ful understanding of the Gospel. I admired her for her devotion to 
this great work and the honor that she manifested toward the Priesthood. 

At the Stake Clerks' meeting held yesterday I said that we do not 
need to be told anything new half so much as we need to be reminded 
of the things we already know. This thought has been constantly in my 
mind during the sessions of this conference. 

The life of the Master is always most interesting to me. I like 
to follow his footsteps while he was here in mortality. 



ELDER JOHN WELLS 91 

When the Master was traveling toward Caesarea Philippi accom- 
panied by his disciples, a marvelous testimony came to them. He 
asked them the question : "Whom say ye that I am ?" And they answered 
him, Peter being spokesman: "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the 
living God." After that he told them many things about his ministry, 
and particularly about his death. He admonished them in this manner : 

"For what is! a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his 
own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?" 

Evidently he was preparing these twelve men for their important 
duties in the establishment of his Church. 

On another occasion a rich young man, a ruler among the Jews, 
came to him seeking instructions. I will read what Matthew has 
recorded regarding the incident: 

"And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing 
shall I do, that I may have eternal life? 

"And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but 
one, that is, God : but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments." 

I have thought of that as the keynote of this conference. 

"He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou 
shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness. 

"Honor thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as 
thyself. 

"The young man saith unto him, all these things have I kept from my youth 
up: what lack I yet? 

"Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, 
and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven : and come and follow 
me. 

"But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful : for 
he had great possessions." 

Let us consider these incidents in the light of our present condi- 
tions. 

Depressions like the one we are passing through come periodically. 
We are never prepared for them. We soon forget the experiences of 
previous depressions. We again ride on the high tide of prosperity for 
a few years, followed by another reaction similar to the present one. 
The living conditions of every person in the country have been affected. 
Property values have fallen. The selling price of the products of the 
soil and the mill have been materially reduced and the purchasing power 
of the people seriously impaired. 

It has been stated that when Martin Luther commenced his great 
reform movement (which after all was a preparatory movement for the 
establishment of the Gospel of Jesus Christ through the instrumentality 
of the Prophet Joseph Smith) the Pope sent word to a high church 
official to "stop that monk's mouth with gold." This official reported 
back: "The fool doesn't love gold." Was he a fool? I believe not. 
There are many things more valuable and more lasting than the pos- 
session of wealth. Pitiable is the poverty of the soul of one who works 



92 • GENERAL CONFERENCE 

for earthly riches alone. The great elevating force in our lives is our 
spiritual growth. 

Those who are in business or who follow commercial pursuits 
require an accounting from time to time to ascertain whether or not 
the business or pursuit they follow is profitable. At frequent intervals 
an inventory is taken of the condition of the business. A statement 
of the business is prepared. If he is a wise business man, he will closely 
examine the balance sheet which will show his assets and liabilities. 
This is the usual routine of commercial life. 

It has been said by many that the merchant or business man who 
never takes an inventory nor has prepared for him a balance sheet, will 
run the risk of becoming bankrupt through ignorance of the condition 
of his business ; and so I say that a man who never takes an inventory 
and balance sheet of himself will run the risk of intellectual and spiritual 
bankruptcy. 

We are now in the last quarter of the year. Like other years, it 
began with new hopes, new resolutions and perhaps a few new oppor- 
tunities. Would it not be proper for us to take an inventory ot our 
general conduct as Latter-day Saints and see if we are increasing our 
spiritual assets and decreasing our spiritual liabilities? 

Brother Nephi Jensen has given a definition of spirituality : 

"Spirituality is that liveliness of spirit that intensifies appreciation of the 
beautiful, deepens loyalty to truth and kindles love for the good; it puts the heart 
in harmony with the moral forces of the world; promotes delight in the realiza- 
tion of high ideals; and quickens in the heart the joyousi glory of being in actual 
partnership with God in the purification and ennoblement of mankind." 

We are all familiar with the Master's injunction: 

"Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon the earth, where moth and rust 
doth corrupt, and thieves break through and steal, but rather lay up for yourselves 
treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt and thieves do not 
break through and steal. For where your treasure is there will your heart be also." 

Now does our spiritual balance sheet show that we have been more 
helpful in the stake and ward where we live? Does it show that we 
have developed those priceless attributes, dependability and loyalty? 
Does it show that we have observed the Sabbath day and kept it holy; 
that we have paid our tithes and offerings? Can the people about us 
say that we are good neighbors? Does this balance sheet show that 
we have kept the Word of Wisdom ? Does it show that we have done 
all that has been required of us in the service of the Lord and his 
Church? If so, we are increasing in spirituality and our assets are grow- 
ing. 

Now let us examine the other side of the balance sheet. Our 
spiritual liabilities will increase when we do not observe the Sabbath 
day, when we are law breakers, when we fail to pay an honest tithing to 
the Lord, when we fail to keep the Word of Wisdom, and when others 
have to labor with us to keep us interested in the Church. If our 



ELDER JOHN WELLS 93 

spiritual liabilities are increasing, isn't it time to ask ourselves the 
question : 

"For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his 
own soul ? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul ?" 

Several years ago there came into my possession a leaflet which 
contained the following questions : Am I really and truly interested in 
my membership in the Church? What am I doing to prove that 
interest? How do I look to the man on the outside? Can he tell by 
my actions that I am living the Gospel? Am I a good example for 
anyone to follow? Would my Bishop classify me as useful, active, 
faithful, or would he classify me as just one of his members? 

My brethren and sisters, let us see that our spiritual assets are 
increasing and that our spiritual liabilities are decreasing; that in spite 
of poverty, disappointments and financial reverses, we do increase in 
faith, keeping always in mind the saying of the Master, "If ye love 
me, keep my commandments." We can show our love for the Master 
by keeping his commandments. 

I am thankful for the Gospel, for my membership in the Church, 
for the testimony that has come to me. I testify to you that I know 
this is the work of God, that Joseph Smith is a Prophet of the living 
God, that he was raised up to stand at the head of this great dispensation 
of the fulness of times. 

Let us constantly remind ourselves of our obligation to our Father 
in Heaven, to this Church, and to one another, that we may grow in 
spiritual power and usefulness in this great latter-day work, I pray 
in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER ELIAS S. WOODRUFF 

President of the Western States Mission 

I believe that this is the eleventh time that I have had the privilege 
of representing the Western States Mission before a congregation in 
this tabernacle, and it is the last time that I shall have that privilege, 
since I have been transferred into another field of labor. I have had 
extreme pleasure in the labor that has been assigned to me, and Sister 
Woodruff has enjoyed it with me. We have had a very pleasant ex- 
perience. We have labored in the mission among many happy people 
in a delightful part of the country. Our experiences have been of great 
benefit and blessing to us. We are very grateful for them. 

I should like to take this opportunity to say a few things about that 
mission that I hope will be interesting to you and appropriate to this 
occasion. In the first place let me speak a word with reference to the 
city of Denver. I had no idea of the beauty of that city until I went 
there to live nor of the fine people who live there, and the splendid spirit 
of civic pride apparent in that city. On every hand we have met with 



94 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

courtesy, kindness and consideration at the hands of the public officials 
and the good people of the city. Denver is a city of beauty and a city 
of extreme civic pride. Her streets are beautiful and clean and lined 
with shade trees ; miles upon miles of beautiful streets with lovely homes. 

You may not know that Denver is the second federal city in America. 
We are told that more federal employees reside in Denver than in any 
other city except Washington, D. C. There are beautiful federal build- 
ings there and of course a number of our own people who are in civil 
service find themselves in the city of Denver. They attend our branch, 
and participate in our worship and in our activities. The branch at 
Denver is one of the splendid little congregations that make up this 
Church. They do things quite on a par with some of the best wards 
in the stakes of Zion. The people there are ambitious to serve the 
Lord and to do his will as well as they can. 

On the other hand we have many small and remote branches where 
Latter-day Saints live, because their occupations take them there, some 
of them from the stakes of Zion.- They are just as anxious as they are 
elsewhere, but they do not ha.ve the opportunity at times to do as well 
outwardly as they appear to do in better organized centers. 

For instance, in the city of Omaha, the moving of the Union Pacific 
offices took a number of our brethren there, some of them who had ex- 
perience in the stakes of Zion and are well trained in the Church. And 
what a blessing they were to those who had already settled in Omaha. 
They came in with a wonderful spirit of humility and broke down the 
old barriers of prejudice that had so long existed there among the local 
converts against so-called Utah Mormons. I believe for the first time- 
to my knowledge at least — we have a fine spirit of harmony between 
the two classes of Latter-day Saints, if Latter-day Saints may be classed. 

Then we have remote districts, even small districts. I could refer 
you to a little place at Lordsburg, New Mexico, where we have four 
women composing a Relief Society. I remember meeting with them on 
a June day, when the temperature was 112. Of these four women one 
of them was president, two of them were counselors, and the other was 
the secretary of the organization. The question arose, Is it worth while 
to try to hold a Relief Society when there are only four women who 
belong to it? Well I had to prove that it was, and so I said, "If there 
were forty of you, would you be happy?" 

"Why of course we would think it was wonderful." 

"Well, now, if there were forty of you, you would only have one- 
tenth the opportunity you now have to participate." 

"Well, maybe that is true. We will try to be happy and carry on." 

So you see we have every type of condition existing, and the people 
do carry on. We try to organize little family Sunday Schools in those 
remote districts, where one or two or three families come together, and 
the wonderful outlines that have been provided by the General Board 
make it possible for them to conduct lessons quite satisfactorily. And 
so the problem before us in the mission is to keep everybody doing 



ELDER ELI AS S. WOODRUFF 95 

something and happy in the circumstances with which they are sur- 
rounded. 

We have twenty-three elders in the mission and eleven sisters, or 
thirty-four missionaries. When I first took charge of the mission we 
had nearly one hundred and forty. With twenty-six organized branches 
there is not an elder to every branch, so the branches have to get along 
without them, and the elders have to be scattered over the districts as 
widely as we can scatter them. Two elders cover the whole area of 
New Mexico, trying to minister to the spiritual needs of the people, to 
baptize the children that arrive at the age of eight years, to bless the 
children who are born, to administer to the sick, and bury the dead, 
as far as they reach them. 

In the western part of the state of Colorado, another great area, 
only two elders are laboring. The whole state of Wyoming, outside of 
the stakes, and the south part of South Dakota — that is the Black Hills 
section — and the extreme western part of Nebraska are covered by only 
two elders. In east Nebraska, in Council Bluffs and Lincoln, and that 
great section of the country, there are four elders and two sisters. In 
Denver — in the whole Denver district, which means the northwest quar- 
ter of Colorado — there are two elders and two sisters. So you may 
understand how inadequately we are equipped so far as the help of mis- 
sionaries is concerned. But the people are happy, they are trying to 
serve the Lord, and locally the people are willing to go out and do mis- 
sionary work, but their labors are confined to the radius of their own 
homes, they cannot go abroad. 

I rejoice that my brethren have seen fit to honor me and to trust 
me with further responsibility. Sister Woodruff and I will leave the 
Western States Mission reluctantly, but grateful for our privileges, and 
we hope to go into the Central States Mission and labor as nearly as 
we can with an eye single to the glory of God. If we can do that and 
discharge our duty and obligation the Lord will bless us, but if we think 
of ourselves we shall not succeed. 

I bear testimony to you that this is the work of God, and I know 
from my experience that if I can just keep in harmony with his Holy 
Spirit everything will go splendidly. When I do not do that it is difficult 
to carry on, for no man can do the work of God except he keeps himself 
clean and sweet and worthy of his blessings. My testimony is that 
this is the Gospel of Jesus Christ, that it is the power of God unto salva- 
tion, that if we will humbly serve the Lord we need not fear, for we 
shall stand in safe places, no matter what happens. If this people could 
believe the word of God and would believe it as it is expressed by his 
servants, their troubles would end and we would be happy and singing 
as the days go by, for the Lord has promised, through his servants, 
that the wicked may be destroyed, but the righteous need not fear. 

May God help us to put our trust in him and serve him, I humbly 
ask, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



96 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

ELDER WILLIAM R. SLOAN 

President of the Northwestern States Mission 

I am thankful this morning that I find myself in perfect accord 
with the teachings of this great conference. I have rejoiced in the 
sessions that have been held in which President Grant was one of the 
speakers. 

As I stand before this microphone I am reminded that every time 
I have returned home from conference so many people have said : 
"President Sloan, we heard your voice over the radio." In our mission 
today thousands and thousands of people are listening to the services 
of this great conference, and as I have pleaded with my people in the 
years that have passed, so I plead today with you, follow the President 
of this Church and you will never go astray. To those who may be in 
Alaska who know my voice, those in Oregon, Washington, Montana 
and northern Idaho, and before this great assemblage of people, may I 
make this plea, keep your eyes on the President of this Church and 
you will never go astray. God bless this work. 

We are now enjoying in our mission many of the opportunities 
of today. Never before have such glorious privileges been given. We 
have only fifteen elders and an equal number of lady missionaries, thirty 
in all, yet our converts are in excess of the converts made a year ago. 
In the thrity-odd branches in our mission over two-thirds of them 
exceed in the amount of tithes paid for the nine months of 1933 as com- 
pared with 1932. We are growing, much interest is being manifest in 
our work, and the Lord is blessing our efforts. 

I should like to read an extract from an editorial in one of the 
largest newspapers published in the northwest in keeping with the 
spirit of this great work : 

"A recent report shows that two-thirds of the inmates of Sing Sing and 
Auburn prisons, New York, are under thirty years of age." 

What a proof these figures are that the home is not adequately 
functioning ! The parents are taking for granted that their sons are safe 
and that the citizen body and the courts are adequately safeguarding 
the nation's children. Jails and prisons are poor substitutes for con- 
science. Crime means a multiplication of criminals and a multiplication 
of convicts. 

If we go on in our lethargy it will not be many generations until we 
shall have a nation composed entirely of convicts or descendents and 
relatives of convicts, in which case we shall have a degenerate people 
without pride of ancestry or hope of honored progeny, a prospect that 
should appal all those who love their country. 

The sacredness of the American home is at stake. I appeal to my 
brethren and sisters to safeguard your homes. 

"Home ain't a place that gold can buy 

or get up in a minute ; 
Afore it's home there's 1 got to be 
a heap o' livin' in it." 



ELDER WILLIAM R. SLOAN 97 

I am not apprehensive for the youth of this Church today, but I 
am vitally concerned with the fathers and mothers. What is your 
example? What is your conduct? What is your loyalty towards the 
Constitution of the United States? What is your loyalty to this great 
Church and your God? The Lord warned this Church in a revelation 
that he was not pleased with the inhabitants of Zion, for there were 
many idlers among them, and their children were growing up in wicked- 
ness. Are they following in the footsteps of us their parents ? 

"A father and his tiny son 
Crossed a rough street one stormy day, 
'See papa,' cried the little one, 
'I stepped in your steps all the way.' 
***** 

"If this man shirks his manhood's due 
And heeds what lying voices say, 
It isn't one that falls, but two, 
'I stepped in your steps all the way.' " 

God bless you, brethren and sisters, to be exemplary in your leader- 
ship as parents in the home, as leaders in the Church and in the com- 
munity. I bear testimony to you of my hope, of my faith, of my belief to 
my entire satisfaction that this is God's work, in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

ELDER MILES L. JONES 

President of the East Central States Mission 

My brethren and sisters and friends — and I say friends because 
I realize that perhaps many of this congregation have not as yet allied 
themselves with this great Latter-day work, and there are also many of 
the unseen audience who are listening in upon this occasion, and they 
are our friends, and we are their friends. We are all brethren and 
sisters, sons and daughters of our Heavenly Father, and he is mindful 
of all of us. 

I am very pleased to bring to you greetings from your sons and 
daughters and relatives who are now laboring in the East Central States 
Mission. The work is progressing in that part of the land, and we are 
meeting with success. During these services my mind has been drawn 
back many times to the work that is being carried on there. 

Yesterday I received a report to the effect that last Sunday three 
honest souls made a trip of some fifty miles to the city of Louisville in 
order that they might receive the ordinance of baptism. This was the 
result of the labors of some of the Saints who had been working with 
those people. They came there for the purpose of receiving the birth 
of water and of the Spirit. 

A short time ago Sister Jones and I made a visit of some fifty or 
sixty miles into the country to visit a family of Saints. They had 
gathered together a number of their neighbors and asked that we speak 
to them, which we did. We stood upon the ground where a few years 



98 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

ago the elders were disturbed and a meeting broken up. At the conclu- 
sion of our meeting, and since then, we have received several invitations 
to come back, or have the elders go and labor a week or so in that neigh- 
borhood, and I have received information to the effect that two of the 
elders are down there now holding a series of meetings, and I am very 
much interested as to the results. 

There are wonderful opportunities in all directions for us to reach 
the people and deliver our message to them. 

During the course of President Ivins' remarks this morning, when 
he referred to those who came to this land years ago, my mind reverted 
back to what I read of early history when I was a boy at school, as to 
the Pilgrim fathers more particularly. They came to this land after 
being persecuted in the land in which they lived. 

In 1906, while laboring as a missionary in England, at the invitation 
of President Grant, a number of missionaries, including myself, ac- 
companied him to the Netherlands Mission. While in Holland we took 
the opportunity of visiting the city of Delftshaven, where is located 
a beautiful chapel, in which the Pilgrim . fathers worshipped the Lord 
after coming down the canal out of the land of Holland. From there 
they crossed the channel to Southampton, from which place they took 
their journey to this land. They landed and settled in some of the 
states that now comprise the East Central States Mission, more par- 
ticularly North Carolina and Virginia. As I travel through those old 
places, such as Georgetown and Jamestown, and other places on my 
way to and from Portsmouth and Norfolk, I cannot help but feel im- 
pressed with the sacredness of those spots where the Pilgrim fathers 
settled in early days in order that they might worship God according to 
the dictates of their own conscience. As people in those sections come 
into the Church today, we find almost invariably that they are descend- 
ants of the Pilgrim fathers and others who settled that land, and thus 
we can in a way account for the wonderful success of the work, because 
those noble sons and daughters in early days came to this land where 
they might worship God as they saw fit. 

I recall now an account that I read in a paper a few years ago of 
a very prominent official of the United States visiting the president of 
one of the South American republics. As they sat upon the verandb 
and were talking over the situation, the President said to this official, 
"How is it that North America has advanced so much more rapidly 
than has South America, nothwithstanding we have more natural re- 
sources, more varieties of timber, more water power and more minerals 
of all kinds, also all kinds of fruit and vegetation? Notwithstanding 
these advantages North America has forged ahead of South America." 

The American official in a characteristic Yankee way evaded the 
question, and asked the President what his view of it was. The Presi- 
dent said : "The only answer I can give is this : those who settled South 
America came here in search of gold, while those who settled North 
America came in search of God." 

And that seems to be the solution of the question. It also accounts 



ELDER MILES L. JONES 99 

for so many today listening to the Gospel message as it is presented to 
them. 

I am thankful, my brethren and sisters, that I have been counted 
worthy, along with these other brethren, of going into the world and 
carrying this message of glad tidings of great joy to those who sit in 
darkness, and there is nothing in all the world that will bring more joy 
and happiness to the souls of men or women than that which comes to 
a person when someone can come to him and say, "Thank God, you are 
the one who brought the light of the Gospel into my home and into my 
life." There are many of your sons and daughters today that can bear 
witness to that fact. 

God bless the youth of Zion. May they be kept in the paths of truth 
and righteousness and virtue, that they may prepare themselves for the 
great responsibility that will rest upon them, because it is only a matter 
of time when they will be called to carry on this great work. God bless 
you, my brethren and sisters, who have charge of the work in the various 
branches of the Church, and in all auxiliary organizations. May you 
have the power, the spirit, and the wisdom to carry on your work, I 
humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

For the very first time during my administration I have not had to 
tell anyone how long he should talk. I am very happy indeed that we 
have got this far along without limiting any of our brethren, but they 
have had the opportunity of saying as much as they wanted to say. 

However, I am thoroughly converted in my own mind that the 
reason we have done so well is that two of the Apostles are in Europe 
and one other is sick. I think that accounts for it. 

According to the count that was made, there were 10,784 people 
in the building at this morning's session. 

Many of the good people whose sons and daughters are in the 
mission field are anxious to meet the Mission Presidents. I shall ask 
Brother Joseph S. Peery to open a room in the Bureau of Information 
where the Mission Presidents can meet any of the Saints who want to 
inquire regarding their missionary sons and daughters. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

After announcing that the choir would sing the anthem, "Song of 
the Redeemed," by Evan Stephens, President Grant made this comment : 

Three years ago, at the Sunday morning session of the Conference, 
this song was sung by the choir under the direction of the author, Pro- 
fessor Evan Stephens, who shortly after returning to his home, follow- 
ing the meeting, became ill and later passed away. We owe a very deep 
debt of gratitude to Brother Evan Stephens, Brother George Careless, 
Brother Ebenezer Beesley, Brother Joseph J. Daynes, and many others 
for the marvelous music they have composed. 



100 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

The Choir sang "The Song of the Redeemed," after which Elder 
S. Taylor Farnsworth, President of the Beaver Stake offered the 
closing prayer. 

Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock. 



THIRD DAY 

AFTERNOON MEETING 

The closing session of the Conference convened Sunday afternoon, 
October 8, at 2 o'clock. Once more the great Tabernacle was crowded 
to capacity, and thousands of people who could not find accommodation 
in that building gathered in the Assembly Hall and upon the Tabernacle 
grounds, where they listened to the services by means of amplifiers that 
had been provided for the purpose, as the proceedings were broadcast 
from the Tabernacle. 

The Tabernacle Choir sang the "Hosanna Anthem" by Stephens. 

Elder Roy A. Welker, President of the Bear Lake Stake, offered 
the invocation. 

The sacred anthem, "For the Strength of the Hills," (Stephens) 
was sung by the Choir. 

PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 

Second Counselor in the First Presidency 

My brethren and sisters, I sincerely hope that the spirit which 
has thus far characterized this conference may be continued in what I 
may say to you today. I trust that whatever I shall say may bring 
something of hope, of cheer, something to encourage and lead us onward 
in this great work in which we are engaged. 

I should like first to pay a tribute to the wonderful broadcast which 
we had this morning. I think I can definitely see an improvement in 
the Choir over even their excellence of six months ago. I congratulate 
them. To Brother Lund and to Brother Asper I also extend my con- 
gratulations ; likewise to Brother Richard L. Evans for his choicely 
worded announcements. I should like to say to the choir that in my 
opinion the secret of their success is that they are rendering gratuitous 
service for the up-building of the culture and the faith, not alone of our 
people, but of the people of the entire world. 

GIVES ENCOURAGEMENT 

We ofttimes hear it said that there should be art for art's sake, 
and I am persuaded that in those great cultural occupations of music 
and art it is necessary that it shall be art for art's sake, and furthermore 
that so soon as any individual or organization begins to commercialize 
itself in art and music it ceases to do the work which otherwise it would 



PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 101 

do. I say this by way of encouragement to this great Choir, which is so 
fatihful in the performance of its duty. 

Service for service' sake is a great truth. 

I wish also to say a few words regarding the great Crusaders who 
were with us at our last conference, and who have been called hence, 
Brother James E. Talmage, who was a life-long friend, and Brother 
Brigham H. Roberts of whom I know through his works. They were 
great captains of the Lord's hosts. They did a great work; they were 
armored in truth ; they loved truth for truth's sake ; they did not depend 
upon the approval of the world for their inspiration nor for their 
courage. While I am sure they enjoyed the approval of the world, they 
worked in spite of it. 

Sometimes I feel that we are prone to look even as little children 
for commendation from the world for what we do and what we believe 
and how we work. It is not a compliment to me for any non-member 
to tell me that I am a human being. We, the people of the Lord, stand 
for the greatest principles which have been revealed to humanity. We 
have no reason to excuse, no cause for apology. 

ANTI-CHRIST PREDICTED 

Brother Ivins referred this morning to the words of the Savior 
given in reply to the question of the disciples : "What shall be the sign 
of thy coming?" and to the fact that great upheavals, political and 
physical, were predicted, and that anti-Christs should arise. 

I wonder, sometimes, if we do not, in considering those things, focus 
our attention too much upon the physical and political upheavals, and 
too little upon the other side of that prophecy, the false and anti- Christ. 
I wonder also whether, when we read these things, we do not think of 
false personages pretending to be Christ, when perhaps the Savior had 
some other meaning, because he spoke of the prophets of the anti-Christ. 
I think he had in mind and wished to warn us against false and vicious 
teachings. 

HERESY PREVAILS 

The world today is torn with heresy ; it seems as if the more 
fantastic the plan and the idea, the more ready we are to listen, and 
sometimes to follow. It seems to me that we have broken loose from 
the moorings which we once had, that we have permitted our minds 
to leave those places in which they found peace and rest and to seek 
new places where neither peace nor rest is to be found. 

What more anti-Christ doctrine could there be than that which we 
so frequently hear nowadays, that Christianity has failed. How could 
Christianity fail in this world, because so far as I know, Christianity has 
not yet been tried. When the world lives the principles which the Savior 
gave unto us, when the world becomes really and truly Christian, then 
it will be time enough to cast the score as to whether Christianity has 
failed or succeeded. An apostate generation may not judge and condemn 
truth. 



102 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

CIVILIZATION HAS NOT FAILED 

How equally unfortunate, as it seems to me, is that statement 
that our civilization has failed. We say that usually because some of 
us unfortunately have not had so much of the material things of life as 
we once had. Civilization has not failed. It has, in the past, sometimes 
paused; it has sometimes halted, but looking at the whole course of 
history it has constantly gone forward, rising from every such pause and 
every such halt to higher and more glorious levels. It is my faith, my 
brothers and sisters, that such it will be when our present tribulations 
are over. 

Moreover, there are some of us who go about saying that if this, 
or that, or the other man-made plan does not succeed, chaos will result. 
It is my faith, my brothers and sisters, that chaos will come only in 
the due time of the Lord, and when the world shall have fully and 
completely rejected his principles and his doctrine. 

We are in a time of great stress. I say a truism, something that 
you all know, when I tell you that some of us are somewhat in want. 
Many of us have lost the garnerings of a lifetime. Some of us know 
not how to turn to meet our obligations. Some of us wonder from where 
will come the necessities of life during this coming winter. Brother 
Stephen L. Richards yesterday assured us of his sympathy, and I can 
assure you of my sympathy. I can assure you of the sympathy of all 
the brethren in these, your trying times. I can assure you that they 
sorrow with you over your privations. I can assure you that what they 
can do they will do. 

But, brethren and sisters, there is a certain side of this depression 
that I wish to bring to your attention. For example : Report has reached 
us that a man having a hundred tons of hay, two hundred head of cattle, 
four milk cows, several pigs and a flock of chickens, last year accepted 
relief. 

NECESSITIES ONLY PROVIDED 

My brethren and sisters, relief is not for those who are in that 
situation. Report has also come to me that in some cases in making 
this recent survey, those making it have been told to urge the people 
to report all they could think of that they needed. Relief can not be 
carried out on that plan. In this relief work we must look forward not 
to the maximum of our desires, nor necessarily the maximum of what 
we have had. Those in need must look forward to the minimum of their 
needs. We can not take care of the situation on any other plan. The 
whole people are not in a position to bestow luxury, or even the full 
comforts to those in distress. If those suffering can be helped from 
actual want, they will have as much as the whole people can do. 

Brother Grant referred, in his opening remarks, to relief from the 
government. I approach this subject with a great deal of feeling and 
strong conviction. The thought that we should get all we can from 
the government because everybody else is getting it, is unworthy of us 
as American citizens. It will debauch us. Judged by my standards it 



PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 103 

is wicked, and followed out it will destroy us. The government of the 
United States has not and can not supply the funds necessary to carry 
on relief work on that basis. We must be as careful with government 
funds as with our own or as with the Church's. Patriotism, loyalty, 
decency, everything demands that such shall be our course. 

COUNTRY NEXT TO GOD 

My brethren and sisters, I want to endorse every word that President 
Tvins said this morning regarding our government. If I know my own 
mind and heart, next to God, the author of my being, comes my country. 
It has been my honor and my privilege to serve it in some more or less 
minor capacities, and if the providences of the Lord shall so order, 1 
stand ready to serve it again. 

This government of ours was established under the inspiration of 
the Lord. We as a people need our government. We must have the 
safeguards which the Constitution throws around us — freedom of the 
press, freedom of speech, freedom of conscience. It has been my op- 
portunity during my life to stand near to some of those who are called 
great. It has been my opportunity to work among those who will always 
work in subordinate capacities in the government. I want to say to you, 
my brethren and sisters, in all earnestness, that I have yet to see the 
man, however great he was, that I would wish to see become a dictator. 
Dictators are not for America, and the doctrine that dictators should 
rule us comes from an evil source. 

COURAGE REQUIRED OF PIONEERS 

As I contemplate our condition today, and contemplate the condi- 
tion of the pioneers when they came into these valleys, I can but wonder 
what they would have thought of our fears, our apprehensions, our com- 
plaints. When I think that their first winter was spent here with scarcely 
enough to carry them through, and with no help nearer than a thousand 
miles by ox team ; when I think of the following spring when they had 
to eat roots to maintain themselves ; when I think of the fear that must 
have been in their hearts when they saw the locusts come in hordes to 
destroy their crops ; when I think of how we are situated, with an actual 
sufficiency, if not an abundance, with communications open and free, 
housed, clothed and possibilities of being fed, it seems that we should 
take courage, we should hold up our heads, we should return our thanks 
to our Heavenly Father for all of his goodness and mercy unto us. 
Think how fortunate the pioneers would have thought themselves to 
be if they had been placed as are we. We should appreciate the Lord's 
blessings, because he does not always bless those who fail in their 
appreciation, and our prayers should be not alone asking for what we 
want, but expressing gratitude for what we have. And after all, my 
brethren and sisters, the temporal things of life, food and clothing, 
and shelter, amount to very little, if we have enough for our actual 
wants. It is only the great eternal truths that count, and we have those 



104 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

truths, and we have a knowledge that they are true. We know that by 
Hving the truth we shall have eternal life in the world to come. 
Peter in his first epistle says : 

"For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. 
The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away; 

"But the word of the Lord endureth forever. And this 1 is the word which by the 
Gospel is preached unto you." 

May the Lord bless us, may he let his Spirit hover over us, may 
he give us peace and courage and confidence, may he enable us to 
see the blessings of what we have in order that we may hold them, 
instead of flying to conditions of which we have no knowledge, may 
he be with us individually and collectively, may he make of us a beacon 
in the world to lead all to the true light of the Savior, I humbly pray 
in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAWSON 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

My dear brethren and sisters, it is a wonderful responsibility to 
stand before a great congregation like this. There are perhaps ten 
thousand people in this building. I trust that I may be strengthened 
for the present ordeal. 

THOSE WHO BRING GLAD TIDINGS 

I have enjoyed every moment of the conference. I am in hearty 
accord with all that has been said and done. I have listened to the 
singing of this conference with rapt interest. I have been thrilled. 
Yesterday a solo was rendered, entitled, "How beautiful upon the 
mountains are the feet of those who bring glad tidings of great joy!" 
If I might be pardoned, I would like to paraphrase this title somewhat 
by saying, "How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of the 
General Authorities of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 
and the Mission Presidents, and the Authorities and presiding officers 
of 104 Stakes of Zion, that are represented in this congregation, who 
bring glad tidings of great joy to the people of the Lord!" 

NOTABLE WOMAN DEFINES SUCCESS 

Some days ago I read a brief article in the public press that has 
caused some reflection on my part. This article sets forth to some 
extent ideas upon the vital question, What is success in life, and what 
is failure? I think you will agree with me that that is a vital question. 
Very often the division line between success and failure is very thin, 
and at other times the division line is very strong. 

If you will bear with me for a few moments I shall be glad to read 
this brief article in your hearing. It concerns the death and burial of a 
notable woman which occurred in New York City, January 23rd, 1933 : 



PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAWSON 105 

"The metropolis prepared a notable funeral today for Miss Elizabeth Marbury, 
76 years old, who considered herself a failure. 

"A renowned leader in theatrical, literary, political and civil life, she never- 
theless believed that any one of millions of obscure housewives was more 
successful than she. 

"When asked for her ideas about success for women, she would say: 

" 'There is only one real success for women ; that is to marry happily and have 
children and a home. In other words', to bring forth life as God intended a 
woman should.' 

" 'If a woman,' she would say, 'has not been blessed with such a union as I 
have in mind, and with motherhood, then it is better for her, if she has talents 
and qualifications, to go out into the world and find some occupation that will 
prevent her from becoming narrow, introspective and unhappy.' 

"Because Miss Marbury had talents and 'went out into the world,' there will 
be a notable funeral tomorrow. Governor Herbert H. Lehman is expected to 
head a huge gathering of distinguished people who will go to St. Patrick's 
Cathedral to pay tribute to the woman who died yesterday of a heart attack. 

"Most people would have said that Miss Marbury's was a full life. She 
was a member of the Democratic National Committee, agent for famous authors, 
adviser to young talent, war worker and woman leader. 

"In a book entitled, 'My Crystal Ball,' she told of her dealings with poets, 
statesmen, dancers, generals, playwrights, and politicians. She was play agent for 
Victorian Sardou and George Bernard Shaw. Oscar Wilde sent her 'The Ballad 
of Reading Gaol' from his prison cell and she sold it here for $250.00. She 
produced 'Little Lord Fauntleroy.' She was a war nurse and once she an;l 
'Big Bill' Edwards sold $10,000,000 worth of Liberty Bonds in ten minutes from 
the steps of the sub-treasury. 

"She crossed the Atlantic seventy times, went bicycling with Nellie Melba 
in Brittany. She saw Paris in ruins just after the Prussian victory in 1870. She 
promoted the New York success of Irene and Vernon Castle and she established 
a highly moral dance hall on Broadway. She got decorated by several governments 
and founded women's clubs. She fought for Al Smith and against prohibition. 

"But, as she would say, 'There is only one real success for women.' " 

Brethren and sisters, to my way of thinking, the woman was just 
about right in the conclusion she reached. Surely the high dignity 
and honor appertaining to the great blessing of becoming a mother 
of men is beyond all comparison with the many things which this good 
woman did. 

THE FIRST GREAT COMMANDMENT 

Is it to be wondered at that the Lord said in the beginning: "It is 
not good for man to be alone. I will make a helpmeet for him." So he 
gave Eve to Adam in marriage in the garden of Eden, and it was then 
that the great first commandment was given which has come thundering 
down through the ages — and is equally binding upon all who live under 
the marriage covenant — namely, "Be fruitful, and multiply and replenish 
the earth, and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea and 
the fowl of the air, and over everything that moveth upon the earth." 

I am quite sure that the phrase, "Be fruitful," did not then mean, 
and does not mean now that the family should be limited in number to 
the husband and the wife and one or two children. No provision was 
made in the first marriage for divorce. It seemed not to have been 
under contemplation, for you will remember that Adam said, having 



106 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

the woman in mind : "She is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh, and 
she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man." 

MARRIAGE A CO-PARTNERSHIP 

Now, in a very real sense, in marriage woman becomes a part of 
man, and it was this thought in mind doubtless that led the Lord to say : 
"What God hath joined together let no man put asunder." The ease 
with which in many instances the marriage tie is sundered is certainly 
very deplorable. Marriage in most countries is solemnized in some 
form ; among the Latter-day Saints it is regarded as a solemn sacrament 
of very great importance. It is learned, by a careful study of the scrip- 
tures and the revelations of God, that the husband and the wife, in 
bringing forth children, actually enter into a co-partnership with God 
in heaven, for the reason that God in heaven supplies the spirit of the 
child and the parents upon the earth furnish the body, and the spirit and 
the body of the child in birth joined together form this great and im- 
portant co-partnership with God. Is it not wonderful, is it not mar- 
velous, is it not an honor of the very highest dignity, that people upon 
the earth have the opportunity of entering into this co-partnership? 
Marriage to the Latter-day Saints means very much more than it does 
to our friends of the other Christian denominations. They marry for 
this world only, but the Latter-day Saints marry for this world and 
the world to come. 

Now, it may be said that there are some Latter-day Saints who 
marry for this world only. What is the answer? It is because of a 
lack of understanding. They little comprehend the nature and far- 
reaching influence of marriage for eternity. 

LATTER-DAY SAINT MARRIAGES 

How lovely it is to contemplate the destiny of a young couple who 
have contracted a Temple marriage; joined hand-in-hand they face 
the battle of life fearlessly, courageously. Still hand-in-hand they pass 
along through the years celebrating at various intervals some very 
important wedding days — there is, for instance, the wooden wedding, 
the pottery wedding, the silver wedding, the golden wedding, and the 
diamond wedding day. Crowned with seventy-five years of happiness 
mingled with trials that were hard to bear this couple descends into the 
grave only to rise again on the morning of the resurrection when they 
will be reunited in the family relationship and will enter into exaltation 
and glory and go hand in hand throughout eternity. 

The nature of the marriage covenant, brethren and sisters, is beau- 
tifully and concisely set forth in one paragraph of Section 132 of the 
Doctrine and Covenants. I will read that paragraph to you. It is 
the 18th paragraph in that wonderful and marvelous revelation given 
to Joseph Smith the Prophet : 

"And again, verily I say unto you," — s'aid the Lord — "if a man marry a wife, 
and make a covenant with her for time and for all eternity, if that covenant is 



PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAW SON 107 

not by me or by my word, which is my law, and is not sealed by the Holy Spirit 
of promise, through him whom I have anointed and appointed unto this power, 
then it is not valid neither of force when they are out of the world, becaus'e they 
are not joined by me, saith the Lord, neither by my word; when they are out of 
the world it cannot be received there, because the angels and the gods are 
appointed there, by whom they cannot pass ; they cannot, therefore, inherit my 
glory ; for my house is a house of order, saith the Lord God. 

I say unto you Latter-day Saints in boldness and without fear of 
successful contradiction that any man or woman who contracts a Temple 
marriage in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and abides 
by the conditions and restrictions of this great law will have lived a 
successful life. That is my testimony. 

A TESTIMONY 

I know that this is the Church of God. I testify that Jesus was 
the Christ who was crucified upon Mount Calvary for the sins of the 
world, and that we today and all future generations and all past genera- 
tions will be benefited by the mighty sacrifice that he made, and what 
might to some have seemed to be a failure, yet the crucifixion of the 
Savior was the stepping-stone to his everlasting success in the kingdom 
of his Father and our Father. 

I testify most solemnly and earnestly that Joseph Smith was a true 
prophet of God, and one of the mightiest of the latter-day prophets. 

May God bless you, brethren and sisters, and bless this great people, 
the Latter-day Saints, is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The Choir and congregation joined in singing the hymn, "Now let 
us rejoice in the day of salvation." 

ELDER REED SMOOT 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles - 

I feel grateful to my Heavenly Father for the privilege of attending 
this remarkable conference. Never in the history of the world was the 
plan of God so necessary as it is today to solve the horrible conditions 
the world finds itself in. What the world needs today is more of the 
Spirit of the living God. 

"I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ; for it is the power 
of God unto salvation." 

THE LOFTIEST AMBITION 

The loftiest ambition of any person is not to receive the plaudits 
of the world but to be honest, honorable and patriotic in every act of 
life. A truly religious man cannot help but become a better citizen, 
no matter in what country he may reside. "In faith, nothing wavering," 
is and has been a fundamental principle of our Heavenly Father's 
Church in every dispensation of the world's history. 



108 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

THE PROPHET'S EDUCATIONAL IDEALS 

Joseph Smith was the author of such sayings as these : 

"The glory of God is intelligence." 

"It is impossible to be saved in ignorance." 

"Seek learning even by study and also by faith." 

"Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise 
with us in the res'urrection. 

"And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through 
his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage 
in the world to come." 

The Prophet was true to his principles. He established schools and 
championed the cause of education. A "Mormon" writer has said: 
"His educational ideals passed over the threshold of time and strode 
down the halls of eternity. With a full appreciation of the knowledge 
that makes men and women capable and skilful in this life, he prized 
and taught others to prize, above all, the knowledge that maketh wise 
unto salvation. How to make a living here — how to solve life's everyday 
problems, was of course important; but how to grapple successfully 
with the mightier problems of the great hereafter, how to store up 
treasures in heaven and lay hold upon eternal life, was far more conse- 
quential. Education meant to him the leading out of all the latent 
potential powers of the individual, the training to perfection of every 
divine attribute in man, as the child of God and as a god himself, in 
embryo. He stood for the full and complete development of the soul, 
body and spirit combined — mental, physical, moral, and spiritual edu- 
cation — the education contemplated and inculcated by the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ." 

REASONABLE AND SOUL-SATISFYING 

In my intercourse with the world I have had ample opportunity to 
come in contact with other religious systems and to compare them with 
my own. If "Mormonism" is my preference over all, it is because it 
appeals to me as the most reasonable of all, the most soul-satisfying 
religion that I have encountered anywhere. 

MAN LITERALLY A CHILD OF GOD 

It teaches that man is literally the child of God, fashioned in His 
image, endowed with divine attributes, and capable, by education and 
development, of becoming like unto that glorious Being, in whose image 
or likeness all men are created. 

EARTH TO BE CELESTIALIZED 

It teaches that this earth, which is but one of millions like it formed 
for similar purposes, was made not out of nothing, as some theologians 
assert, but out of the eternal elements, spirit and matter, and that after 
it has filled the measure of its creation as a temporary abode, a place of 
probation for man, it will be converted into a celestial sphere, that the 



ELDER REED S MOOT 109 

righteous may inherit it forever. Christ's millennial reign is to sanctify 
the earth and prepare it for celestial glory. 

god's kingdom 

"Mormonism" teaches that the glorified planets are God's kingdoms, 
and that to each kingdom a law is given. Whosoever inherits any one 
of these kingdoms — celestial, terrestrial or telestial — must abide the law 
pertaining to that kingdom ; all heavenly gifts, whether spiritual or 
temporal, being predicated upon the principle of obedience. 

REWARDED ACCORDING TO THEIR WORKS 

All men are to be rewarded according to their works, as shown 
to John the Revelator in his great vision on Patmos. They who inherit 
celestial glory, the highest heavenly condition, which is comparable to 
the light of the sun, are they who receive the Gospel in this life; also 
those who would receive it if the opportunity were offered. They can 
believe and repent in the spirit world and receive baptism by proxy in 
temples erected on earth for that purpose. These are the valiant who 
obey Christ in all things. 

The inheritors of terrestrial glory are they who yield a partial, but 
not a full obedience to the divine commands. They receive not the 
Gospel here but afterwards receive it, and their glory is likened unto 
that of the moon. Telestial glory is for those who are cast down to 
hell, are there purged of their sins, and after paying their debt to 
Eternal Justice, are released from prison to receive that for which they 
are fitted and prepared. They are as the twinkling stars, and are ser- 
vants of. the Most High, "but where God and Christ dwell they cannot 
come, worlds without end." 

All men will be saved except the sons of perdition, who have had 
every opportunity not only for salvation but for exaltation to the highest 
glory; and then have denied, trampled upon and thrown it all away. 
These are the only ones who cannot be saved in some degree of glory ; 
and the reason why they are lost is because they have sinned away the 
power of repentance, upon which all salvation is predicated. 

LOYALTY TO COUNTRY 

"Mormonism" 'was made possible, humanly speaking, by the estab- 
lishment of the government of the United States, whose constitutional 
guarantee of religious liberty paved the way for the coming forth of 
this "marvelous work and wonder." 

The Latter-day Saints believe that they must be loyal to their coun- 
try, honoring its laws, upholding its institutions, its constituted authori- 
ties, and doing all things that American citizens ought to do. They are 
taught that the Constitution of the United States was inspired of God 
and framed by wise men whom the Almighty raised up for this very 
purpose, and that it "should be maintained for the rights and protection 
of all flesh," so that every man may act according to the moral agency 



110 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

which God has given him, that he "may be accountable for his own 
sins in the day of judgment." 

Believing this, they cannot be otherwise than loyal. They do not 
blame the government of the United States for their past persecutions 
at the hands of lawless mobs. They realize that such things were not 
because of the Constitution and the Government, but in spite of them; 
and they stand ready at all times to honor the laws of this nation and to 
defend it against foes without or within. 

"In faith, nothing wavering," has been a fundamental principle of 
all God's servants from the beginning of time. 

A TEST OF FAITH 

An opening incident in the lesson of faith to which I wish to call 
your attention today is an occurrence of a long time ago, as human 
history runs. But its lesson comes to this very hour in the crisis we now 
are facing. The hosts of Israel who had been held in Egyptian bondage 
had been led from the land of their detention. On their way to the new 
land they had met discouragements, defeats and victories. In it all, their 
great leader had pressed them forward to learn, through many miracu- 
lous displays of divine power which came to them in the vicissitudes 
of their journeying in the Arabian deserts, that God lived — the God of 
their fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. They were learning, too, 
that as descendants of those great patriarchs theirs was a chosen race 
for a great destiny. Among other things, they were to be a blessing 
to all the families of the earth. 

As a starting point in their destiny from this time, they were to 
begin a national existence in "the promised land" — the land which the 
"Lord thy God giveth thee." Of those who had been led out of Egypt 
forty years earlier, only two remained alive, Joshua and Caleb. All 
the others had found graves in the desert. Yet Israel had become a 
"great and a mighty people." The children who had been born in the 
wilderness were reared in their varying ages under the leadership of 
the mighty Prophet Moses. The adult body of those children included 
a considerable force of able-bodied fighting men. But now their great 
leader, who had brought them to the crisis of actual entrance upon the 
promised land, had passed from their midst. It was a test of their faith 
in God, individually as well as collectively. The leadership had been taken 
over by Joshua, whose confidence in the mission of their departed prophet 
was unshaken. Testing them in their faith, as a body and as individual 
members thereof, came the incident to which I have made reference. 

A VITAL AND FUNDAMENTAL COMMAND 

It was then and there that the Lord gave to Joshua this vital and 
fundamental command, as vital and fundamental to those in Israel today 
who hold the Priesthood as it was to the leader Joshua on the borders 
of the promised land nearly thirty-four centuries ago: 



ELDER REED SMOOT 111 

"Only be thou strong, and very courageous; * * * for then thou shalt make 
thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success." (Joshua 1 :7, 8) 

Israel moved forward to success. The basic foundation of accept- 
ance and of conformity with the admonition thus given was faith in 
God. 

A REDEEMER PROMISED 

Only a few years earlier it had been declared (Numbers 24:17) : 
"There shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Sceptre shall rise out of 
Israel." 

The great Prophet Isaiah later explained (Isaiah 59:20): "The 
Redeemer shall come to Zion, and unto them that turn from transgression 
in Jacob, saith the Lord." 

This was to Israel the promised and hoped for Christ, who so firmly 
declared this basic principle of faith in the living God (John 14:1) : 
"Let not your heart be troubled ; ye believe in God, believe also in me." 

PRINCIPLE OF FAITH STRESSED BY CHRIST 

Through all his ministry, Jesus stressed this principle of faith. 
When the afflicted woman had but "touched the hem of his garment" in 
her desire to be healed, he said (Matt. 9:22) : "Daughter, be of good 
comfort ; thy faith hath made thee whole." And to his disciples he said 
for occasions when they came to the necessity of performing some im- 
portant work (Matt. 17 :20) : "Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as 
a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence 
to yonder place, and it shall remove." 

In the observance and exercise of the principle of faith, nothing 
that was proper to be accomplished would be impossible to them. This 
same teaching of the great importance of faith goes all through the 
record in the New Testament. 

ON THE WESTERN CONTINENT 

Not only in the Old World was the active exercise of faith in God 
impressed upon the people. Here on the western continent, among 
dwellers on this land before the opening of the Christian era, there comes 
in the sacred record these words of impressive testimony (2 Nephi 
25 :26-29) : 

"We talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesy 
of Christ and we write according to our prophecies, that our children may know 
to what source they may look for a remission of their sins. * * * 

"And now behold, I say unto you that the right way is to believe in Christ 
and deny him not; and Christ is the Holy One of Israel; wherefore ye must bow 
down before him, and worship him, with all your might, mind and strength, and 
your whole soul ; and if ye do this ye shall in no wise be cast out." 

In the further record of Christ's visit to people on this continent 
after his resurrection, there is abundant illustration of the surpassing 
power of faith in God, as this was exercised in accord with the Gospel 



112 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

of Jesus Christ. This is a faith shown by our works that are in harmony 
with the laws of God as these are set forth in his revealed word. It 
is a living, effective, courageous faith. It is a whole-hearted recognition 
of the great truth declared by the Apostle John in his gospel as recorded 
in the New Testament (John 3 :16, 17) : 

"For God so loved the world, that he gave his 1 only begotten Son, that who- 
soever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. 

"For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world ; but that 
the world through him might be saved." 

IN THIS DISPENSATION 

In this later age, when the "falling away" of the early Christian 
Church foretold by the Apostle Paul (2 Thessalonians 2:3) had reached 
a culmination to the approaching "hour of God's judgment" (Rev. 
14:7), the young man Joseph Smith, then under fifteen years of age, 
was impressed by the Spirit of the Lord to call upon God for guidance 
under the disturbing circumstances of his day. His reading of the Bible 
included the general epistle of the Apostle James. It advised him to 
"ask of God" (James 1:5). He considered carefully the admonition 
in the sixth verse of the first chapter, "Let him ask in faith, nothing 
wavering;" and in the seventh verse that the man who wavered in his 
faith would not receive the desired blessing. Joseph asked in unwavering 
faith and received the great revelation from God so necessary for this 
dispensation. Divine authority was restored to earth, and the Church 
of Jesus Christ again came into existence, with all its gifts and powers. 
That organization is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 
in which we claim membership. 

"in faith, nothing wavering" 

Now, I ask for myself, as I ask for the Saints, are we ready to seek 
the Lord, each and every one of us, "in faith, nothing wavering?" Our 
faith, to be unwavering, also must be shown by our actions as well as by 
our words. Our human opinions and ambitions must not be our chief 
desire. We need to be wholly willing, when we ask the Lord in faith 
for wisdom, to receive direct that which the Lord is willing to give. 
This may be a difficult thing to do ; but doing it is the living, unwavering 
faith recognized in the Gospel of Christ as bringing results. Then, 
when we do that, we are in a frame of mind to profit by the instruction 
and promise which I have quoted : 

"Only be thou strong, and very courageous ; * * * for then thou shalt make thy 
way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success." 

May we all, by our unwavering faith in the present purposes of 
God, be strong and very courageous in meeting the present crisis, that 
we may have good success in being in strict accord with God's great 
purposes for us, individually as well as collectively, is my prayer, in 
Jesus' name. 



ELDER REED SMOOT 113 

ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

"Great and marvelous are thy ways and thy works, O Lord, our God !" 

This expresses my feelings as I have sat through the various sessions 
of this conference, and listened to the words of the various speakers, 
and felt the impress of the Spirit of the Lord which has been with us ; 
and as I sat with you this morning and listened to the beautiful musical 
rendition by the tabernacle choir, with the accompanying music, which 
was broadcast throughout these United States and possibly beyond its 
borders into other nations of the earth, and the islands of the sea, which 
is quite possible by the means which have been employed by men in 
this day and time. 

FOR THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF GOD's WORK 

One may say : Why, these are but the inventions of man. Yes, they 
are the inventions of man, inspired of God for his honor and glory and 
the accomplishment of his work in the earth. The Savior, as recorded 
in the twenty-fourth chapter of Matthew, spoke of the time of his 
second coming, and said her: 

"This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness 
unto all nations ; and then shall the end come." 

That was to immediately precede the great and dreadful day of 
the Lord, the ushering in of a millennial reign of peace. 

For more than a hundred years the Latter-day Saints, on whom 
rests this responsibility, have been engaged in the preaching of the 
Gospel with more or less of success. We are here, as a congregation 
of Latter-day Saints, as the result of the preaching of this Gospel in 
the nations of the earth. We are here located in the valleys of the 
mountains, having gathered from the nations of the earth through the 
preaching of the Gospel. 

The Lord without a doubt has inspired those men of inventive 
genius, who have brought forth the radio and this broadcasting, for his 
own purpose, and I think I can see how that in a very short time this 
Gospel of the kingdom may reach into every nation, to every kindred, 
tongue and people, in all parts of the world. We are already using 
this system of preaching the Gospel in a number of the mission fields, 
and from Salt Lake City. Marvelous indeed are the works of God. No 
man can fully comprehend them. 

WORK NOT RETARDED 

As remarks were made with reference to our brethren of the 
General Authorities who have recently departed this life, my mind has 
run back over the history of the Church since the days of the Prophet 
Joseph and the Patriarch Hyrum, who gave their lives for the Gospel's 



114 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

sake. When the Prophet and the Patriarch were martyred there was a 
feeling among a great many people that their death would end this work, 
commonly known as Mormonism. But the blood of the prophets has 
proven to be the seed of the Church, and there was no retarding of 
the work, but it broadened out and extended, under the leadership of 
President Brigham Young, the legal successor to the Prophet Joseph, 
and those associated with him, and they passed on. And still the work 
persisted, with no evidence of its being retarded in the least. And so 
from one presidency to another, six of them having passed away, and 
the work goes on and gets stronger and stronger, greater in numbers, 
better and more thoroughly organized, and with greater accomplish- 
ments. 

Now, these good brethren of ours whom we have dearly loved, with 
whom we have associated so closely and have known so well for their 
virtues and their worth, have passed on. They belong to another world 
and have another life of activity to live. While they lived here such a 
thing as rest and recreation were scarcely known to these two men, 
indefatigable laborers for the cause of truth, for the cause of the Master, 
in studying, in preaching the Gospel, and in writing books, they scarce- 
ly had any peers in this Church. We will miss them of course, but will 
the work be retarded ? Not at all. 

THE WORK OF GOD 

And why this condition of stability and uninterrupted progress from 
the inception of the work down to the present time? Because of the 
greatness, the bigness and the magnitude of this work, being God's 
work, and his arm and hand are over it. He is at the helm and giving 
direction. Men haven't made this great work that we are engaged in, 
"Mormonism," so-called. But this work has made men of renown, 
noblemen such as these our brethren who have recently passed beyond. 
That is the glory of this work, the greatness of it, the bigness of it. 
Nothing like it in all the world ! It is the biggest thing known to man. 

The Latter-day Saints have no serious objection to the use of the 
word "Mormonism," notwithstanding the name was given to us by 
those who are not of us, who never intended it for a compliment. We 
understand that the word "Mormon" in itself means "more good," and 
the word "Mormonism" is comprehensive, in that it stands for the 
Church and kingdom of God upon the earth, and the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ, which in very deed is the power of God unto salvation. 

More minutely described we might say it is the plan of the Gods 
for the existence of this world, this earth on which we live ; and for 
man's existence upon the earth ; for man's fall, for that was considered 
in the plan in the beginning, and for the fall of the earth ; for the redemp- 
tion of man and the redemption of the earth ; for the glorifying of the 
earth, for it is to be renewed and receive its paradisical glory ; and for 
the eternal life and exaltation of man. 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 115 

FOR THE SALVATION OF MAN 

As the Lord talked to his servant Moses he made plain to him his 
plans and purposes concerning his creations, and told him that they 
were for the accomplishment of man's salvation. 

"Behold, this is my work and my glory — to bring to pass the immortality 
and eternal life of man." 

The Gospel was instituted for this purpose. The Prophet Joseph 
tells us that we were all present in the council of heaven ; that we sat 
in council with the Gods ; that we saw the plan of salvation made, and 
the Savior chosen and appointed, and we sanctioned it. We must have 
had a long period of life and experience in the spirit world to have been 
able to sit in council with the Gods upon such momentous questions. We 
must have understood the plans and purposes of the Lord, and we must 
have subscribed to them. Every man that has been born in the flesh 
came with a definite understanding that he was to work out his salva- 
tion according to the plan of the Gospel, that he might attain the blessings 
of eternal life and exaltation. It involves the acceptance of certain 
principles, the receiving of certain ordinances, the obeying of the laws of 
God, the keeping of his commandments, the making of sacrifice, the 
rendering of service, the denying ourselves of that which is evil, the ac- 
ceptance of that which is good. 

OUR RESPONSIBILITY 

Our remembrance of the past was taken away, and in the language 
of the scripture, we must live while here in the flesh by faith and not by 
sight. But we have had the word and will of God revealed to us, through 
his prophets whom he has raised up, so that we are not in the dark. As 
we have investigated and have received the Gospel, we have received 
a testimony of its truth, and with it a responsibility for the carrying on 
of this work looking to the saving of the souls of men. It involves 
the preaching of this Gospel in all the world. It involves the building 
of temples and the redeeming of the dead. It involves the organizing, as 
we are organized, as a great Church, for the proper teaching and training 
of our children, for the finishing, we might say, of the conversion of 
those who have been gathered in from the world. 

Even in the world where we have these organizations they are to 
prepare men and women in the faith and integrity and ability to engage 
in this work. Every man and every woman that comes into the 
Church, every convert, is expected of the. Lord to be a missionary for 
him, whether he be called to labor at home or abroad, or having no 
calling whatever specially given unto him. 

The word of the Lord is to the effect that he that is warned is 
to warn his neighbor. Every young man in this Church ought to have an 
ambition to go -upon a mission, realizing that all that he has and enjoys 
of the Gospel and hope of eternal life is the result of the preaching of 
this Gospel ; that if we have not ourselves heard it in the world for the 



116 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

first time, and been converted, our parents or our grandparents or our 
great-grandparents have, and we are partaking of the fruits of their 
sacrifices and their labors. We should have a desire to pay the debt of 
gratitude we feel for the Gospel, by imparting the knowledge we have 
of it to those who are in spiritual darkness. 

A SECOND OBLIGATION 

One important obligation resting upon us as a Church is to get 
missionaries, and another important obligation is that of looking after 
them when they return. There are men who have left remunerative 
positions of labor to go upon missions, and when they have returned they 
have walked the streets of Salt Lake City, and have gone from city to 
city seeking in vain for employment, and some of them having families 
to maintain. That is a very regrettable condition and discouraging to 
others who contemplate going upon missions. 

I think it is serious when a High Priests' quorum can not help a 
returning High Priest, or a quorum of Seventies will allow one of their 
members returning from a mission to go months and years without 
desired and deserved employment. They ought to have that spirit of 
brotherhood and helpfulness that they would either furnish employment 
for him or help him to find employment. 

MEETING THE EMERGENCY 

The shortage of missionaries creates an emergency in the mission 
field today. One way of meeting this emergency is that of utilizing 
more fully the labors of the brethren and sisters who are residents in the 
missions, in the preaching of the Gospel. A local man may accompany 
an elder from Zion, and make a full team of two in tracting or doing 
any other kind of missionary work. If that were carried out as it 
might be, it would double our corps of missionaries, and it would build 
up the Saints who might be thus engaged. 

Another thing : Many of our missionaries in the field spend too 
much of their time in visiting the Saints, in settling difficulties among 
them, and encouraging those who are indifferent in the faith, all of 
which is necessary, but it should be done as far as possible by local 
men and women, that the regular missionaries may be at liberty to 
find new friends and preach the Gospel to them. 

Branches should be organized with teachers as they are in the 
wards and branches in Zion, with local men and women who go into the 
homes of the Saints regularly and make an effort at keeping peace, 
settling difficulties, answering troublesome questions, etc. 

There is some opportunity for improvement, and I think the exigen- 
cies of the case demand an extra effort along these lines by those who 
have the work in charge. 

WORK FOR THE DEAD 

Then there is the work for the dead. That is one of the things 
that is required of us — service for God and our fellow-men. There is 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 11? 

no better way of serving God and our fellow men than that of working 
for the redemption of our dead in genealogical research and in temple 
work. They go hand in hand. The temple work for the dead can not 
be accomplished without first obtaining the information such as is neces- 
sary to identify them upon the records of the Church and in the temples. 
This work is growing and increasing, which is very gratifying. 

There are a great many people who are out of work and who are 
wasting their time, who could go to the temple and be laying up for 
themselves treasures in heaven, treasures that would not, slip away from 
them, and at the same time be saving the souls of men and women. 

There are people who are living far distant from the temples and 
can not very well get to the temples. You would do well to spend a 
little of your money in genealogical research from a distance, by writing 
the Genealogical Society of Utah, giving them a few items of information 
pertaining to your ancestors, and see what they can do for you in the 
way of genealogical research. Then, if you can not go to the temple, 
perhaps there are some in the community in which you live who are in 
need of employment, who could go to the temple. Give them some 
relief by employing them to represent you and at the same time you 
will be spending your money in the redemption of the dead. 

A GOSPEL OF SERVICE 

This Gospel is a Gospel of work, of service to God and our 
fellowmen, from beginning to end. It is not sufficient that we be simply 
good, or that we ourselves embrace the principles and ordinances of the 
Gospel, but we are to teach them to others and administer the ordinances 
thereof to those who are prepared to receive them, all things being done 
in proper order. 

May the Lord bless the Latter-day Saints, that we may be able to 
understand our responsibilities, and be able to discharge them in a way 
that will be satisfactory to the Lord, who knows what we are doing and 
what we are not doing, and in a way that when we have finished this 
life we will not meet with disappointment; that when we go on the 
other side and meet our dead we will not be reproached for having 
neglected them. May the Lord help us to this end, I pray, in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

President Castle H. Murphy of the Hawaiian Mission has been in 
the hospital for a week and has been confined to his home another week. 
He has cabled us that he is now able to continue with his work and 
sends greetings and aloha to the Authorities and the Saints. 

I am sorry that the good people who are listening to these services 
over the radio will be deprived of the privilege of hearing the last song 
by the choir, as I understand that the radio broadcasting company will 
shut us off the air promptly at four o'clock. I am going to rob the choir 



118 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

of the privilege of being heard over the radio when they sing the closing 
number. They had an hour this morning and were heard all over the 
United States, so I am going to take the five minutes that belong to them. 
I am very grateful that there have been five minutes left for me. I 
do not remember that this has happened before. 

BLESSES LATTER-DAY SAINTS 

I feel in my heart of hearts to bless the Latter-day Saints. I feel 
grateful to the Lord beyond all the power and ability he has given me to 
express my feelings for the devotion and faith and integrity of the 
Latter-day Saints. I feel grateful to them for their prayers in my behalf 
a year ago when I was in the hospital. 

CONFERENCES ESTABLISHED BY GOD 

I really felt when this conference opened that we could not possibly 
have a conference that would equal the one we had six months ago. 
Perhaps I enjoyed it so much at that time because I had been absent 
from the previous conference, but I feel in my heart that we have been 
blessed as abundantly during the three days of this conference as we were 
six months ago. God established these conferences. Nothing but the 
Spirit of the living God could bring together such a congregation as we 
had here this morning, and as we have here this afternoon. 

The General Conferences of the Latter-day Saints are one of the 
great outstanding testimonies to me of the divinity of the work in which 
we are engaged. I have now attended these conferences as one of the 
General Authorities of the Church for fifty years, lacking only the ones 
that I missed when I was in Japan and in Europe and when I was ill 
a year ago. I have heard the expression after each and every con- 
ference, "The best we have ever had." 

BECAUSE OF APPETITE FOR SUCH THINGS 

The main reason why each conference seems to be the best is that 
we have an appetite for such things. On one occasion after I had been 
shoveling snow for many hours, being on a delayed train at the time, 
dry bread tasted very sweet. It almost makes my mouth water today 
as I think of Zebulon Jacobs, in a snow blockade between here and 
Ogden, inviting me into his car and taking a piece of iron and breaking 
an old piece of bread and dividing it with me. Hunger makes food 
very delicious. Hunger for the Gospel of Jesus Christ makes us enjoy 
these conferences. 

We have had a time of rejoicing. I have been grateful beyond 
expression for all that has been said in this conference, for the spirit 
of the brethren and the inspiration to them. I am grateful to the Lord 
for the freedom of utterance that I had in my opening address. 

INVOKES BLESSINGS 

May God bless the Latter-day Saints at home and abroad, and so 
far as the power is given to me to call down the blessings of the Lord, 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 119 

I bless you one and all, not only those who are here, but those who are 
in any part of the world who are serving God and laboring for his cause. 
I pray from the bottom of my heart that God will bless the President 
of the United States, his Cabinet, and the officers of our States and 
Counties. I pray that there may be such loyalty in the hearts of all 
citizens of our country that they will not try to impose upon the govern- 
ment. Men offered their lives for this country during the World War, 
and I think it is a shame that any man who is in such a favorable 
financial condition as the one referred to by President Clark would draw 
support from the government of the United States. 

God's blessings upon you, I ask in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The Choir sang, as a closing number, "Jehovah," (Schubert) solo 
part by Sister Margaret Stewart Hewlett. 

Elder Albert H. Belliston, President of the Juab Stake, pronounced 
the benediction. 

Conference adjourned for six months. 



Professor Anthony C. Lund, assisted by Albert J. Southwick, con- 
ducted the singing at the Conference meetings. Accompaniments and 
interludes on the great organ wei " played by Frank W. Asper and Wade 
N. Stephens. 

Stenographic notes of the Conference were taken by Frank W. 
Otterstrom and Joseph Anderson.

THE FALLING AWAY 

By B. H. ROBERTS 

This new work is a ringing challenge to Christendom and a frank 
indictment of the multifarious creeds that are an outgrowth of the dis- 
integrated Apostolic Church. It shows most conclusively and brilliant- 
ly that all the churches had departed from the true pattern of Christ 
and lost the authority completely, long before the New Dispensation 
was ushered in through the instrumentality of Joseph Smith. 

Yet the motive of the author is not to tear down, but rather to 
build up; had there been no "falling away," the claim of the prophet 
of the New Dispensation would have been an imposture; if there was a 
"falling away," however, his claim is credible. It was to establish this 
fact sharply and conclusively that these radio addresses were given. 
All who heard Elder Roberts or who will read these published dis- 
courses, will agree that he has accomplished the end in a scholarly and 
convincing manner. 

Though most of the discourses deal with eras of apostasy and 
centuries of discord, the ultimate message of the book is one of hope 
and salvation for the world. The three discourses on the Restoration 
read like the happy outcome of an otherwise tragic story. You feel at 
the end that the author has performed a necessary but melancholy 
task, only that he might invest with true meaning the unique claim of 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 

The Appendix of the new work is an answer to Catholic charges 
that the author had been unfair in his use of evidence and presentation 
of historic facts. His reply is given with enough zestful detail to 
leave the reader without a single doubt.

CA c (Jhrillin& Story of 

CENTURY ONE OF 
CHURCH HISTORY 

mERE is a new story of "Mormonism," told with a com- 
pleteness and charm that will thrill Latter-day Saints 
with a pride of achievement and at the same time win 
the admiration of the critic, be he friend or foe. In a COM- 
PREHENSIVE HISTORY OF THE CHURCH, B. H. Roberts 
has done a masterful piece of research and has set down the 
record of Century One — 1830 to 1930 — in a brilliant appraisal of 
momentous events. The reader with a sentimental interest will 
be fascinated with this narrative of truth stranger than fiction; 
the reader who approaches the new work with the critical vision 
of the historian will find it fair in statement, authentic in fact, 
copious in detail and sound in judgment. 

A COMPREHENSIVE HISTORY OF THE CHURCH was writ- 
ten by Elder Roberts at the instance of the First Presidency of 
the Church, with a commission to make it exhaustively complete, 
from the remotest beginnings to the close of the Centennial 
Conference of April 6, 1930. The final volume ends with an 
account of the Conference itself, making the history technically 
inclusive of all that happened in Century One of the organized 
existence of the Church. Thus it is a fitting commemoration of 
one hundred years of struggle and achievement. 

This monumental work is not to be confused with any former 
history, journal or chronicle. Though its nucleus is the history 
of "Mormonism" published a few years ago in AMERICANA, 
running serially for six years through that magazine, yet this 
History is NEW — new in its wealth of material, new in method 
of treatment and new in its physical representation of the book 
maker's art.

Thousands of people from the Stakes and Missions of the Church 
had assembled and occupied the seats in the great auditorium and

opening prayer. 

A sacred duet, "My Task," was sung by Charles Martin and 
Myrtle Checketts. 

PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 

First Counselor in the First Presidency 

This is the first general conference of the Church, my brethren and 
sisters, so far as I remember, at which the President of the Church 
has not been present to direct the proceedings. You are all advised 
no doubt that President Grant is in Chicago at a hospital recovering from 
an operation to which he has recently subjected himself. 

PRESIDENT GRANT'S ILLNESS 

The question may be asked, and has been, why did the President 
of the Church go to Chicago for treatment when there is a Latter-day- 
Saints hospital here in Salt Lake City, with efficient expert surgeons 
and doctors to give medical care to those who may be in need of it ? He 
went because the people who were consulted in regard to his condition, 
which was critical, admitted that there was no one here whom they felt 
could be trusted with the particular treatment to which it apparently 
became necessary for him to subject himself. So after careful con- 
sideration it was decided that he should go there for this treatment. 

MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT 

I have before me a telegram just received from him which I am 
sure you will agree with me demonstrates the wisdom and the necessity 
of the action which was taken. It is addressed to me to be delivered to 
this congregation of Latter-day Saints, and is as follows : 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. WINS 



3 



"Extend to the Saints in conference my love and blessings. My gratitude 
to them for their faith exercised and prayers offered in my behalf. I have been 
greatly blessed. I feel sure conference will be profitable and enjoyable as they 
have always been. Regret not being with you. Earnestly praying the blessings 
of the Lord to attend the Saints both at home and abroad and also all honest 
people the world over, 

Affectionately, 

Heber J. Grant." 

The telegram received this morning from the President indicates 
his rapid recovery. The physicians, however, who have the case in 
charge consider it wise that he remain at the hospital until he is so far 
recovered there will be no danger at the time he shall leave it. 

GRATITUDE FOR IMPROVED CONDITION 

This is a great source of relief and gratitude to God our Father 
to his brethren associated with him, the presiding authorities of the 
Church ; and I am sure this congregation of people and the Latter-day 
Saints wherever they may be participate in this expression of gratitude. 

We are here in this conference as usual to be informed in regard 
to the condition of the Church, the people who constitute its membership, 
and to receive from those who will be selected to address us instruction, 
admonition and exhortation as the Spirit of the Lord may prompt 
them to express themselves. 

CHURCH OUT OF DEBT 

• 

First, let me say to you, notwithstanding the reports that are being 
industriously circulated by people who have been excommunicated from 
the Church because of their transgressions, but who now assume to 
dictate its affairs and instruct us in regard to the procedure that should 
be followed at this conference, to the effect that the Church is heavily 
involved in debt, that its property is mortgaged — I heard only yesterday 
that this block and all of ;the buildings on it were under mortgage — I 
want to say to you, my brethren and sisters, that the Church is not in 
debt to anyone, not a penny. No one holds its notes. There is no 
mortgage on the property that belongs to it or that ever has belonged 
to it, unless it has passed into other hands and been mortgaged by them. 
It is true that in this time of depression the revenues of the Church 
have suffered just as yours have suffered, but thank the Lord, through 
your devotion to the law of tithing, there are funds sufficient to carry on, 
and we have no apprehension so far as the future is concerned. 

I am making this statement that you may not be disturbed regarding 
this particular report and many others similar to it which are only 
designed to embarrass the Church and to lead its members and others 
who are not members of the Church astray. 

PROGRESS IN THE MISSIONS 

The missions of the Church. It is true again that because of the 
financial condition of the people the number of missionaries who are 
engaged in carrying the message of the restored Gospel to the people

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



of the world has been reduced. People have not the funds that they 
formerly had with which to maintain themselves or their sons or 
daughters in missionary work. But there are still a sufficient number of 
Elders In the field that reports show that the results are perhaps more 
favorable than they have been before for many years past. Converts 
are_ constantly being made ; baptisms are being solemnized ; the organi- 
zations of the Church are being maintained in the different missions, 
stakes and branches of the Church, probably in better condition today, 
from the point of view of organization and results accomplished, than 
they have ever been before. This is again a source of great satisfaction 
to the brethren who direct the Church. 

RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION 

The schools of the Church, like everything else that pertains to us, 
have of necessity been somewhat limited in their activities, but the fact 
remains that in the most prosperous period in the past of our Church 
school system instruction was given to 8,687 students, children of 
Latter-day Saints. These Church schools, numbers of them, have 
already been discontinued, and it is the policy of the Church to entirely 
discontinue the system as it formerly existed, substituting for it a system 
of instruction that meets far more people than ever before. According 
to the statistics which are before me, the seminary system of the 
Church during the past year — and they do not cover the latter part of 
this year, which will greatly increase this number — has given religious 
instruction to 30,862 Latter-day Saint children. The pupils who are 
in attendance at the high schools are registered in these seminaries. I 
shall not read all of the statistics before me, but a very large percentage 
of all the children eligible to registry are registered in these seminaries. 

We know it was a great disappointment to the people of the Church 
when the Church schools were discontinued. It was to us. We did so 
regretfully, but we do know that we are giving religious instruction 
now to nearly four times the number of children that we instructed in 
the Church schools when they were at their peak. So we believe again 
in the good result which is to come from this change. 

TEMPLE WORK 

The temples of the Church have never before been so busy as they 
are at present. The people, perhaps because so many are out of em- 
ployment — that might have something to do with it, but not altogether — 
their minds are turned more towards the ordinance work which is 
performed in the temples for their progenitors, with the result — I 
haven't the figures before me — the general result has been reported to 
us, we get these figures monthly — temple work being accomplished is 
greater than ever before in the history of the Church. 

THE WORK OF THE LORD 

These particular items, my brethren and sisters, I am referring to 
because they are fundamental to the work of the Church. They are

S 



institutions which belong to it. They are sound, every one of them, 
just as the Church itself. It is the work of the Lord restored to the 
earth with a promise never before made to a people so far as we are 
aware, that its priesthood should continue, and that means that the 
Church itself shall persist until it shall ultimately triumph. 

This is a dispensation the greatest that was ever ushered in in the 
history of the world, because it comprehends all that has been before 
it and all that shall come after it. 

INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY 

May the Lord help us to magnify our callings, the responsibility 
which rests upon every member of the Church. For when we identify 
ourselves with it, when we enter into the waters of baptism, when the 
hands of those in authority are laid upon our heads, conferring upon us 
the keys of the holy priesthood, we enter into covenant with the Lord 
that we will discharge that responsibility, magnify it in our lives by 
example and by precept, every man bearing witness to his neighbor ; 
and in that manner the Gospel will spread rapidly among the people 
of the world, who are at last coming — the honest thinking people of 
the world — to understand the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints as it really is. 

God bless you, I pray, my brethren and sisters, help you and help 
me to magnify this important responsibility that is upon us, I ask 
through Jesus Christ. Amen. 



PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAWSON 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

My brethren and sisters, as President Ivins has already announced, 
we very much deplore the absence of President Grant from this con- 
ference, but we are glad to know that he Ss convalescing and rapidly 
recovering from his operation. I am sure it is the desire of the Church 
generally, that President Grant may he spared to preside over us for 
many years and that his days may not be numbered less. 

We also note the absence of Brother Ballard, one of our number, 
who has also undergone an operation which is often times considered 
a serious one, but in his case the operation was quite successful and he 
is rapidly recovering. 

Of course we are necessarily without the presence of tBrother 
Widtsoe who is in Europe, a long distance from us, and could not very 
well be here. But we have Senator Smoot with us, I am happy to say, 
at this conference. 

Let me say, brethren and sisters, that to stand before a great 
congregation of Latter-day Saints like this is a privilege and responsi- 
bility. I therefore ask for your sustaining support by the exercise of 
faith in what I shall say on this occasion.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Purpose in life 

I am impressed now to read a few words from a well-known and 
prominent writer, and perhaps if I may have freedom of the Spirit I 
will make a few comments upon these words. 

"Many a philosopher has propounded the conundrum, 'What is the object of 
life? Why have we been placed upon this planet, to struggle along for a few 
years and then to die? Has a beneficent providence some scheme which we 
cannot fathom?' 

"This conundrum has not yet been answered." 

The writer is regarded as quite an intelligent man, and he has 
written a very great many good things. But it might be safely said 
to him that life is not a conundrum, that there is a 'ireal purpose in it ; 
and if the writer had been in dose touch with the scriptures and the 
revelations of iGod that are recorded in the Bible, the Book of Mormon, 
the Doctrine and Covenants and the Pearl of Great Price, he would have 
discovered, as I have already said, that there is a purpose in life and 
that that purpose has been developed by the great Creator of the world 
and of the people of the world. 

Yes, but it might be said by him, perhaps : "I do not believe in the 
Bible, I do not believe in the Book of Mormon that you mention ; I do 
not believe in the Doctrine and Covenants or the Pearl of Great Price." 

PREDICTIONS FULFILLED 

Well, the answer is : Perhaps you do not; but nevertheless whether 
you believe them or do not believe them they are in existence, we have 
them, and we have Learned from those books that holy men of old wrote 
and spoke as they were moved upon by the Holy Ghost. Many of the 
things that they said were written down, some of them were great pre- 
dictions, and in the passage of time a large number of them have already 
been fulfilled to the very letter, although they were uttered hundreds 
and hundreds of years ago, and others will be fulfilled. This is pretty 
good evidence of their genuineness. 

And then it might be said in reference to" the revelations of God 
given in these latter-days to a mighty prophet whose name was Joseph 
Smith, that they have stood the test of one hundred years. They have 
been attacked upon many occasions by unbelievers but have never been 
overthrown. A number of the predictions recorded in these revelations 
have also been fulfilled, and that is about the best test that could be made 
with respect to the scriptures or the revelations from God. 

THE PRE- EXISTENT STATE 

This man, as I have already said, if he had been in strict accord 
with the word of the Lord, would have known that the children of men, 
including himself and all others, lived before in a pre-existent state in a 
place that is designated as heaven. When heaven is spoken of we 
naturally conclude that it is a place of peace and happiness, that those 
who dwell there are happy, that God himself, our Father, and his Son 



PRESIDENT RUD.GER CLAW SON 



Jesus Christ and the holy apostles and prophets and Saints dwell there. 
That the society of such people is what constitutes heaven and makes 
for happiness. They dwell there, and we dwelt there, in the pre-existent 
state as spirits. If somebody were to ask what did we look like when we 
existed there as spirits, I should answer that we looked just like we 
look now, only we were spirits in the form of God. We were his chil- 
dren in the spirit and must necessarily have partaken of his likeness. 
Surely that is reasonable. 

It must have been a place of happiness because when rebellion 
arose in heaven it could not long survive and was cast out. We read 
in the book of Revelation, that there was war in heaven between Lucifer 
and his host of spirits and Michael and his host, and that Lucifer and 
his followers were overthrown and cast down. "Therefore, at that 
particular time happiness was restored and must have continued in 
heaven. 

SPIRITS NOT COMPLETE 

A time arrived, however, when these spirits were in need of some- 
thing further, or in other words, it must have been known in that pre- 
existent state that the spirits of men were not complete in their creation, 
that there was something lacking, something that should be added to 
them. Of course, I am speaking now strictly in accordance with Holy 
Writ. The time arrived when these spirits came forth upon the earth. 
But it was their coming that proved to be so interesting a matter. We 
read about it in the opening chapters of the Holy Bible, the Bible of the 
Christian world which is our Bible also. It is set forth in great clear- 
ness. 

God said : "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness." 
And the record tells us that God did create man in his own image and 
after his likeness. He said, Let us do it, and the act of performance 
followed. A little farther on the matter is amplified, like my words are 
being amplified and made a little clearer by the radio, when we read that 
"God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his 
nostrils the breath of life ; and man became a living soul." 

LIVING SOULS 

• I say to you that that was an extraordinary thing, and it occurred 
at the very beginning in the experience of Adam and Eve. They 
became living souls and their children who followed them also became 
living souls. Now to be a living soul is a very different thing from 
being a living spirit. The breath of life referred to that was breathed 
into man, was in fact his spirit. This is made very clear in the revela- 
tions of God given to his people in both ancient as well as modern 
times. 

The difference is this : When the immortal spirit of a man 
secures and enters a mortal body, it can then be said, I take it, that his 
creation is complete. He is a living soul. 



8 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



That other thing, his body, so necessary to his present and future 
welfare, has been added to his spirit. , 

This is set forth in great plainness in section ninety-three of the 
Hook of Doctrine and Covenants, wherein the Lord says : 

"For man is spirit. The elements are eternal, and spirit and element, in- 
separably connected, receive a fulness of joy; 

"And when separated, man cannot receive a fulness of joy." 

PURPOSE OF LIFE 

What a wonderful saying ! It discloses the very purpose of life, 
namely, that man, a living soul, is capable of attaining to and expe- 
riencing a fulness of joy. That is the answer to the conundrum 
respecting "the purpose of life." In other words, man is placed in a 
position by this fulness and completeness of his creation that he can 
receive a fulness of joy. He does not necessarily have it unless he 
makes himself worthy of it by compliance with the laws of God. 

Now, the Lord doubtless had this matter in mind when he said, as 
recorded in the Pearl of Great Price : "This is my work and my glory, 
to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man." That is the 
special work in which God our Father is engaged, and I take it from 
a reading of the scriptures, and from reflection, that God cannot be 
engaged in a greater work than to bring to pass the salvation of souls, 
and it is in the principle of salvation that we are to find a fulness of joy. 
Somebody may say, perhaps this very writer may say, "What do you 
mean by salvation?" Well, it simply means that a man must first be 
saved from his weaknesses and imperfections, and secondly, that he 
must be saved from his sins and follies. 

HOW TO BE SAVED 

How can he be saved from them ? By forsaking his weakness and 
by repenting and forsaking his sins, after which he may get remission 
of his sins by and through an ordinance of the Gospel, viz., baptism. 
Possibly the writer heretofore mentioned might add, "Well, what do you 
mean by the Gospel?" 

We mean by the Gospel just what Paul said about it. He said: 
"I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ ; for it is the power of God 
unto salvation, to every one that believeth." The Savior said that those 
who rejected it and would not have the Gospel, would be damned, or, 
in other words, would come under very great condemnation. If you 
do not like the word damned use the word condemnation, because both 
words mean exactly the same thing, only one is a little more expressive 
than the other. And so we find that salvation is to come through 
obedience to the Gospel. 

THE DESTINY OF MAN 

Now there is another very wonderful thing in the scriptures if we 
shall go back to Adam, and it is contained in the Book of Mormon, II 



PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAW SON 



9 



Nephi, second chapter, as I remember it, and that is this : "Adam 
fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy." 

So we come right back to this question of the purpose of life — 
"Men are, that they might have joy." We might say, God is that 
he might have joy, a fulness of joy, and so his Son Jesus Christ is that 
he might have a fulness of joy, and that would mean that God has a 
fulness of salvation, and that Jesus Christ has a fulness of salvation. 
They have attained to it. They have conquered. Jesus Christ has risen 
above his enemies. He has gone beyond. They have no power over 
him at all. He has all power, and is saved, and therefore, brethren and 
sisters, he must be in a condition or state of perfect joy. 

That is the destiny of man. But that destiny must be clearly 
understood by man and must be followed in order that he shall rise 
to exaltation and glory such as that which has been received by the 
Savior and his apostles of old and the Saints who have been resurrected 
who will enter into glory and exaltation. 

MUST BE BORN AGAIN 

How is that to come about ? Let me signify. We are told that the 
Savior revealed it, but he did it in a way that Nicodemus perhaps did 
not comprehend, and in a way that the Christian world today does not 
appear to comprehend. Jesus said, as recorded in the Gospel by St. 
John, 3rd chapter, that "except a man be born again, he cannot see the 
kingdom of God." That was a very confusing statement made to Nico- 
demus. He wondered about it. He wondered how a man could be 
born again. Must he go back and be born once more? The Savior 
saw his predicament, saw that he was ignorant of the matter, and said : 
"Nicodemus, except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot 
enter into the kingdom of God." If a man cannot enter the kingdom of 
God he cannot rise to a fulness of joy, never, worlds without end. 

He may get some joy, he may get great happiness from what he 
does do in righteousness, but to get a fulness he must be born again. 
It is an actual birth, just as we were born into the world to get these 
bodies, so we must be born into the kingdom of God — perhaps I should 
say born into the church and kingdom of God, I think perhaps they 
will be merged together sometime. The kingdom of God and the church 
of God are not very far apart. One cannot , get into the kingdom of 
God upon the principle of faith alone, or repentance alone, or re- 
ceiving the Holy Ghost alone. He will have to be baptized, go down 
into the water, and come up out of the water, and have hands laid upon 
him for the gift of the Holy Ghost. That is the procedure that was 
followed by the apostles of Christ. That is the procedure of the Church 
today. It is the only way. 

Baptism, then, may be said to be the door that leads into the kingdom 
of God, or into the church and kingdom of God. How beautiful that 
is ! There is an actuality about it, you can visualize it. I am not 
spiritualizing. There is an earthly work to do. And then when one 
gets into the kingdom of God there is a greater work to do because it 



10 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



is word upon word, line upon line, precept upon precept, that one must 
learn by experience after he conies into the Church and kingdom of 
God. A man is not saved by baptism altogether. The opportunity of 
salvation, the power to be saved, yes, it is there, but he must exercise 
that power and do the work that is necessary. 

WORLDLY THINGS TO PASS AWAY 

Now, in conclusion, let me say this to you, brethren and sisters of 
the Church: The man who expects to find a fulness of joy in the 
light and frivolous pleasures of the world or in matters pertaining strictly 
to the world will be sadly disappointed, because it is said that a man 
whose heart is wedded to the things of the world is carnally minded, 
and we are told in the scriptures that to be carnally minded, or alto- 
gether worldly minded, is death, but to be spiritually minded is life 
eternal. There it is, and we should remember that as Latter-day Saints 
we must not give ourselves wholly and completely to worldly things, 
loving them above everything else. Wle have to deal with them, and we 
need them, too, but we must be spiritually minded if we will attain 
to a fulness of joy. 

Now, this is what the Lord says about the matter in section one 
hundred thirty-two of the Doctrine and Covenants. Listen to this 
tremendous declaration of the Lord by revelation to Joseph Smith the 
Prophet. We wish the whole world could hear it. It might cause them 
generally to sit down and reflect upon life : 

"And everything that is in the world, whether it be ordained of men, by 
thrones, or principalities, or powers, or things of name, whatsoever they may be, 
that are not by me or by my word, saith the Lord, shall be thrown down, and shall 
not remain after men are dead, neither in nor after the resurrection, saith the 
Lord your God." 

We ought not to cling to those things that will pass away and never 
return. We should rather take hold of the things that are destined to 
remain. 

IMMORTAL THINGS 

This is what Henry Drummond says, which is pretty much to the 
point, and has some bearing upon what I have been saying : 

"There is a great deal in the world that is delightful and beautiful; there is 
a great deal in it that is great and engrossing; but it will not last. All that is 
in the world, the lust of the eye, thelust of the flesh, and the pride of life, are but 
for a little while. Love not the world, therefore. Nothing that it contains is 
worth the life and Iconsecration of an immortal soul. The immortal soul must 
give itself to something that is immortal. And the only immortal things are these : 

" 'Now abideth faith, hope, love ; but the greatest of these is love'." 

That is a wonderful saying, is it not? There is mighty power in 
love, and you might say all power in faith. We could not succeed with- 
out both.

THE RICHES OF THE WORLD 

Now some people, many people perhaps, some in the Church, 
think that this happiness I am speaking of, or fulness of joy, may be 
found in the riches of the world — in gold, silver, houses, lands, etc. Let 
me quote from a certain publication what is said respecting a very 
wealthy Russian nobleman : 

"No one who is not rich, attractive, very young, and the center of an admiring 
social circle, can have any idea how intolerably tedious riches, beauty, and 
popularity can be. Felix Felixovich had everything he could possibly want: 
he was master of the largest and imost valuable collection of precious stones in 
the world, of palaces and castles and enormous estates; he had accomplished the 
highest that a man of noble blood, a descendant of the Elstons could accomplish ; 
he had won the hand of an imperial princess ; his friend was the handsome 
universally admired Grand Duke Dimitri. And yet for him this state of per- 
petual happiness which hid nothing more in itself, which held out no promise of 
new experiences, which could • offer him no further secrets, attractions, or 
excitements, was one of intolerable boredom and emptiness. 

Like many other Russian aristocrats, Prince Felix did not avail himself of 
the possibility of filling his life with intellectual interests, and consequently he 
was tormented by the painful boredom of the absolutely rich and absolutely 
happy person, the man to whom nothing is forbidden, and to jwhom therefore, 
nothing any longer seems desirable. Inevitably, he began to feel his life of 
perpetual riches as a prison, from which there was no escape. His beautiful 
wife of imperial blood, his beautiful and elegant friend, the many adorers, male 
and female, and the handsome men and pretty women who flocked about him, 
were bound ultimately to seem like merciless warders, who 'kept him shut up in 
his prison of disconsolate [boredom. 

"The poor can hope for riches, the unloved for love, and the lowly for 
elevation; but for the man who like Felix Yusupov, is surrounded by enormous 
wealth, perpetual [happiness, and unending pleasure, there remains no other 
outlet from his spiritual prison but crime. As the ray of light coming through 
his grating, so to the young prince, crime seemed the only hope of freedom. To 
commit a crime and once more taste a new, still unknown excitement was a dream 
like the prisoner's dream )of freedom." 

In conclusion, brethren and sisters, I testify to you in all solemnity 
after fifty years of experience that I do know positively with a firm 
knowledge and an abiding faith that this is the Church of God and of 
his Son Jesus Christ, that Jesus was and is the Savior of the world, 
and that Joseph Smith was and is a true prophet of God. I have great 
pleasure and happiness in bearing this testimony on this occasion. The 
Lord bless you in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 

Presiding Bishop of the Church 

I am happy, my brethren and sisters and friends, to be with you in 
this conference this morning. I rejoice in the divine power that actuates 
this great work. Notwithstanding the adverse conditions that prevail 
at the present time I am sure that we all have occasion to be grateful 
for health and life, for appreciation of the divinity of this work, and 
for the privileges and blessings that have been given to us. I expressed 
yesterday to President Ivins my feeling that, if he desired, I would be 



12 



GENERA E CONFERENCE 



perfectly willing to forego being called upon to speak in this conference, 
so that he could have the opportunity to call some who are not ordinarily 
called upon. I realize that there are many men in the Church who have 
had experience and training, who are carrying responsibility throughout 
the various divisions of the Church, who could advise with us and 
address us upon matters that would be helpful and encouraging. 

CHURCH GROWTH AND ACTIVITY 

Nevertheless, I am happy to bear my testimony and to express to 
you my faith and assurance that this work is growing and will continue 
to grow and accomplish the great destiny that is before it. In this 
connection it may interest you to know that the Church has shown 
greater numerical growth throughout the United States during the 
past 15 years, from 1916 to 1931, in proportion to membership than any 
of the largest churches. The same is true of the increase in the number 
of congregations or wards. In Church activities of the priesthood and 
the members there is improvement steadily in evidence. Also, in social 
welfare and in matters of vital statistics, this work is making an enviable 
record. As was stated by President Ivins this morning, there has 
been a decrease in the tithes of the Church because of the very serious 
economic condition, but there has been an increase in the number of 
tithepayers, showing greater faith on the part of the people. I believe, 
however, that there is still opportunity for improvement in this respect. 
Our young people need to be taught and trained and encouraged to 
observe this principle, which is spiritual as well as economic, for their 
welfare and progress and faith in the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Every 
boy and girl should be trained by their parents to pay tithing on whatever 
they may obtain in the way of earnings or gifts. They should be en- 
couraged to try to earn regularly and to tithe such income. We are 
urging especially that every member of the Aaronic priesthood shall be 
taught the observance of this divine law. The decrease of tithes is due, 
as you will appreciate, to the fact that there has been much unemploy- 
ment : and consequently those who have been unemployed have been 
unable to pay their tithes ; and also very much by the low prices of 
commodities. 

FACTORS OF VITAL IMPORTANCE FOR BETTER CONDITIONS 

There are two economic factors at the present time in this com- 
munity and throughout the nation, and I suppose throughout the world, 
that justify the greatest thought, attention and consideration and action 
on the part of those who have responsibility in government. They 
are of vital importance for the economic welfare of the people. One 
of these, which is more or less temporary, is the provision for emer- 
gency unemployment relief. That is being undertaken in a large 
measure throughout the nation by federal, state and local aid, and 
through various organizations. I wonder sometimes whether there is 
too much red tape attached to the obtaining of aid by those in need. Yet, 
of course, great care is necessary to see that those who need the aid 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 



13 



shall obtain it, and that those who* are able to carry on without that aid 
will do so. It is a very vital thing to prevent hunger, with consequent 
difficulty and trouble that are bound to ensue if people do not have the 
necessities of life. 

HIGHER COMMODITY PRICES 

The other factor that is important in order that we may obtain 
better conditions and the only permanent means is that we may obtain 
higher prices for the staple raw commodities. How we are going to 
bring that about, whether by an appropriate method of reducing the 
value of the dollar, or in some other manner raising the value of com- 
modities, is a very vital and important question that concerns all mankind 
at the present time. 'When the condition prevails that prices on raw 
commodities rise, the people of this state as well as of adjoining states 
and of the nation at large will be able to meet their obligations more 
fully, and carry on. 

INDIVIDUALISM AND COOPERATION 

I appreciate the fact that this Church, in the midst of these adverse 
conditions, is meeting the test of its efficiency and its divinity most 
effectively. The Church involves, as I see it, two phases of human 
activity. One is individualism and the other is co-operation. That 
may sound like a paradox. We know that our salvation depends upon 
our individual efforts. Except we do certain things, live in accordance 
with certain principles, and accept and conform to certain ordinances 
of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, we cannot obtain the blessings, just as 
was referred to by President Clawson this morning relative to one of 
the Gospel ordinances. Salvation comes through observance of divine 
principles. So the individual can be saved only by his own acts. 

INDIVIDUAL EFFORT AND INITIATIVE NECESSARY 

At the same time the Gospel involves also co-operation and mutual 
helpfulness of all the members of the Church to produce results. No 
co-operative movement can be most successful except through indi- 
vidualism-^that is through the individual development and activity of 
all concerned. If you will study any co-operative movement that has 
ever failed, you will find that where it has failed it was due to the fact 
that every individual was not measuring up to the standard expected 
and required. Where the individual has not measured up in energy, 
whole-heartedness and unselfishness, the movement has been weakened. 
So today in this and in all communities throughout the nation it is 
expected that every individual will use all of his powers and faculties 
in every way to try to save himself financially, spiritually, and in every 
other respect. But it requires also that we shall endeavor to co-operate 
to the fullest extent possible. 

CO-OPERATIVE ACTION IN THE CHURCH 

For instance, throughout the Church 1 think there never has been 



14 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



such co-operation shown in helpfulness towards those in need as at 
the present time. The reports that come to us from all parts of the 
Church indicate that the presidencies of stakes and their associates, the 
bishoprics of wards, and those working under their direction, and the 
Relief Societies throughout the Church, are doing a tremendous work 
in the gathering of foodstuffs and taking care of the same for the benefit 
of those in need. Never was there, I think, such a spirit shown as at 
the present time of seeking to help those in need. Many of those who 
are in need are co-operating also in going out and helping to gather 
foodstuffs. They desire to work for what they get as far as it is possible 
to do so. There are, however, some who claim membership in the 
Church — and there are people outside of the Church, who feel that the 
world owes them a living and that others ought to do for them the 
things that they should do for themselves. There are those who do 
not take advantage of the present opportunities offered to obtain the 
necessities of life for themselves, strange as it may seem. 

ALL SHOULD USE THEIR ENERGIES 

There are ample food supplies throughout this country and gen- 
erally within reasonable distance of those who need them, if they would 
but go out and gather the essentials and commodities which they need 
for their subsistence. They could get them almost for nothing and 
take care largely of themselves. I have not time to go into detail 
regarding these things, but call your attention to the fact that it is 
vitally important that everyone who is in distress and trouble should 
seek as far as possible to help himself. 

THE WORTHY AND THE UNWORTHY 

The Lord has made plain to us that those who are poor and are 
worthy, who are seeking to improve themselves, seeking to remedy their 
condition as far as possible, shall be blessed. But those "whose spirits 
are not contrite, whose hands are not stayed from laying hold upon 
other men's goods, whose eyes are full of greediness, and who will not 
labor with their own hands" are subject to censure. They should use 
their own initiative and their own efforts. Likewise, those who are 
well-to-do who are not willing to impart of their means for the benefit 
of the poor, shall suffer, whereas the well-to-do who use their means 
effectively will receive blessings. 

STAKES ORGANIZED FOR SOCIAL WELFARE 

. I would like to report to you briefly just a slight indication of all 
that is being done throughout the Church for the care of those in need. 
In this city, where probably the distress is greater than in almost any other 
part of the Church, four of the stakes have established storehouses. 
They have been sending out as many as hundreds of men at a time to 
gather food supplies, with the understanding that those who work and 
gather supplies will obtain orders on the storehouse for the things they 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 



15 



need. It is a very remarkable thing the way it is being done in these 
stakes, and the same is true largely in other stakes in the Church, 
although I have not the figures before me. 

QUANTITIES OF SUPPLIES GATHERED 

For instance, hundreds of thousands of pounds of potatoes, onions, 
cabbage, tomatoes and other vegetables, and various fruits, have been 
gathered and stored or distributed to those who are in distress. The 
perishable supplies have been distributed promptly. Other things that 
are not perishable are being stored for those who will be in need this 
winter. There has been considerable dried fruit prepared. In these 
four stakes alone without regard to what is being done in the Relief 
Societies in the various wards thereof, about 44,000 bottles or cans of 
fruit have been put up by the storehouses for the benefit of those who 
are or will be in need. There have been about 12,000 pieces of clothing 
gathered which are being repaired and remodeled for the benefit of 
those who are in need.- Over four hundred pairs of shoes have been 
gathered ; and wood and coal are being provided. It is a wonderful thing 
that is being done. The spirit of co-operation — the Spirit of true religion 
— is being manifested by busy men and women sacrificing their own 
time and labor for the benefit of those in need. I am sure that if those 
who are going to receive this help will appreciate it, and will manifest 
their resourcefulness and their initiative in trying to carry on they will 
be able to go forward and gain relief from the economic distress that 
prevails at the present time. 

CHILDREN OF ISRAEL TOLD TO GO FORWARD 

I am reminded of the time when the Israelites were being led out 
of Egypt under Moses. They had gotten out of the land of Egypt 
and away from the ruie of Pharaoh, and had reached the Red Sea when 
the Egyptians came after them. In the distance they saw the armies 
of the Egyptians pursuing them. They complained to Moses about the 
situation, saying in effect : "Why did you bring us into the desert here 
to be destroyed by the Egyptians, rather than to remain among them, 
and bear their tasks?" And Moses said: "Stand still, and see the 
salvation of the Lord." Then he said: "The Lord shall fight for you 
and ye shall hold your peace." Then the Lord said to Moses, "Where- 
fore criest thou unto me? Speak unto the children of Israel, that they 
go forward." They were commanded not that they should "stand still," 
but that they should "go forward." We are told that a path was made 
through the Red Sea, and the children of Israel went forward promptly, 
and escaped the clutches of the Egyptians. 

APPLICATION TO PRESENT CONDITIONS 

In that experience it seems to me that there is a lesson for us today. 
We are surrounded by difficulties and troubles. We are pursued by 
conditions that are entirely unfavorable to us. Sometimes I think we 



16 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



feel that we ought to stand before the Lord and ask him for blessings. 
That is, of course, entirely proper and necessary. But I think also it 
is important for us that we should go forward with confidence and faith, 
using our initiative, developing our resourcefulness, employing every 
possible means to remedy the conditions which prevail around us, 
individually and collectively, with the assurance that the more we try 
to do for ourselves the more the Lord will help us, because we are 
using our own faculties to remedy our condition. Thus we show our 
faith by our works. 

GO FORWARD WITH COURAGE AND FAITH 

Conditions are now and have been such with very many of us, 
that our attitude has been much the same as that of the Israelites in 
their fear and distress. Certainly, under the prevailing status, there 
is much reason for worry and strain. Many are carrying obligations 
that can be met with difficulty, if at all. Products of the farms can 
scarcely be sold for sufficient amounts to meet the requirements of the 
farmers. It is a situation which merits the mutual consideration and 
helpfulness of all concerned. 

Yet, now is the time to "go forward." It is vitally necessary to 
employ all our faculties with resolution and initiative, to resist worry, 
to plan and work vigorously and systematically, to adjust our require- 
ments to our resources, to cultivate increased faith in God, and to seek 
the guidance of the Holy Spirit, in order to face the present and the 
future with courage and determination. I am sure that if we will 
strive earnestly in this way, the way will be opened before us whereby 
we may carry on and have joy, satisfaction and peace. 

I pray that the Lord may bless us all, that we may go forward with 
faith in him, using every power that he has given to us and every 
faculty, to the end that we may glorify his name and help to build up 
his kingdom, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

Sister Elsie Cook sang a sacred solo, entitled "Rest in the Lord." 

PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 

First Counselor in the First Presidency 

I have withheld the statistics that I am now about to read to you 
until the Presiding Bishop made his report. 

TO RELIEVE DISTRESS 

These figures show what has been done by the Church during the 
nine months from September 30th, 1931 to June 30th, 1932, in order 
that the distress to which he has referred might be relieved. 

Ten Stakes of Salt Lake County, all within this valley, have 
contributed as follows : 

From Fast offerings, $34,026.86. 

From Relief Society donations, $28,470.56. 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. 1VINS 



17 



From the tithes which you, my brethren and sisters, have paid into 
the storehouse of the Lord, $105,114.27. 

There has been disbursed by the ten stakes in Salt Lake valley for 
the relief of those in distress $177,437.70. 

There has been contributed by the people of the other stakes of 
the Church: 

In fast offerings, $76,071.76. 

Through the Relief Society, $58,000.59. 

From the tithes, $32,018.89. 

Total amount paid by the Church during this period from fast 
offerings alone, $1 10,098.62. 

If we all paid our fast offerings as we should there would be 
sufficient, I believe, to take care of those who are in actual need. 

There was received from the Relief Society $86,471.15. 

There was received from the tithes paid in the various stakes. 
$137,133.16. 

The total amount contributed during the past ten months from the 
tithes and offerings of the people to those who are in need is $361,242.79. 
It does not need comment to satisfy you, I am certain, that the members 
of the Church are doing their duty as far as attention to those who are 
in their communities who are in need is concerned. 

ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL 

Of the First Council of Seventy 

I take it that we will all be relieved when I get through. I 
certainly got the surprise of my life this morning. I anticipated being 
in agony most of the conference. I desire you to know and feel that I 
am trying to tell the truth, which I find is a very difficult thing to do. 
It is not my intention to skate around on thin ice and keep you people 
in anxiety. I know as well as I know anything that a man cannot speak 
to the Latter-day Saint people — in fact he should not, if he can only 
determine the matter — except when he is under the influence of the 
Holy Ghost. I have never been able to determine when I am going to 
speak by the direction of the Holy Ghost and sometimes when I thought 
I had it some of the brethren did not think so. So it leaves me in doubt 
and uncertainty. 

I do not know why we should be fearful among our people, or 
anywhere else as |long as we make efforts to serve God and keep his 
commandments . 

I have been thinking about something for some time. I haven't 
got it in the form of ia speech. Men come to me occasionally, not very 
often, and shake me by the hand and say, "I am glad to shake hands 
with a good man." I never feel so "cheap" as when that happens, 
and I have always been thankful that they did not know me so well 
as I know myself. It is along that line that I would like to talk to you 
for a few minutes. 

What is a good man? That has been a big problem with me. I 



IS 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



have had a good deal of business dealings with men who (claimed to be 
good men. They said they were good and they told me how good they 
were, and when they got through with me I did not have anything left. 
(Laughter.) Whenever a man comes to me now and tells me how 
honest he is, how good he is, I am not going to do business with him. 

I am going to read to you a little 'from the Book of Mormon. I 
'remember an Apostle on one occasion — I had been interviewed regarding 
something I had preached — said to me, "Golden, why don't you read 
the Book of Mormon ?" 

I said : "I do |as much as you do." And that was true at that time. 

I have read the Book of Mormon. I have tried to understand it : 
I have tried to appreciate it; I have tried to believe it as my father 
believed it. There was no book that Heber C. Kimball read more and 
believed in more than he did the Book of Mormon. 

I find that a man can act good and talk good and look good and 
not do any good. That 'which I am going to read to you is from 
Moroni's writings in which he tells something about a good man, which 
his father had told him. I haven't the time to tell you about the goodness 
and greatness of Mormon and Moroni, but T have great love for those 
characters. I quote the following : 

"For I remember the word of God, which saith by their works ye shall know 
them ; for if their works be good, then -they are good also. 

"For behold, God lhath said a man being evil cannot do that which is good ; 
for if he offereth a gift, ior prayeth unto God, except he shall do 5t with real 
intent it profiteth him nothing." 

"For behold, it is not counted unto him for righteousness. 

"For Ibehold, if a man being evil giveth a gift, |he doeth it grudgingly : 
wherefore it is counted unto him the same as if he had retained the gift; 
wherefore he is counted evil before God. 

"And likewise also it is counted evil unto a man, if he shall pray and not 
with real intent of heart ; yea, and it profiteth him nothing, for God receiveth 
none such. 

"Wherefore, a man being evil cannot do that which is good ;" * * * 

I am glad he bears down on that. 

* * * neither will he give a good gift. 

"For behold, a bitter fountain cannot bring forth good water; neither can 
a good fountain bring forth bitter \vater ; wherefore, a man being a servant of 
the devil cannot follow Christ ; and if he follow Christ he cannot be a servant 
of the devil. 

"Wherefore, all things which jare good cometh of God; and that which is 
evil cometh of the devil ; for the devil is an enemy unto God, and fighteth against 
him continually, and inviteth and enticeth to sin, and to do that which is evil 
continually. 

"But behold, that which is of God inviteth and enticeth to do good continually : 
wherefore, every thing which inviteth and enticeth to do good, and to love God, 
and to serve him, is inspired of God. 

"Wherefore, take heed, my beloved brethren, that ye do not judge that which 
is evil to be of God, or that which is good and of God to be of the devil. 

"For behold, my brethren, it is given unto you to judge, that ye may know 
good from evil; and the 'way to judge is as plain, that ye may know with a 
perfect knowledge, as the daylight is from the dark night." 

I desire now to call your attention to what Moroni said just prior 



ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL 



19 



to hiding the plates in the Hill Cumorah. It is just what we read in 
the Bible. I might go into this subject a little in detail, but time will 
not permit. I am not given to discussing things, to he arbitrary, but 
when I make a statement I want to do so hoping that you will think 
about it and get some good out of it. In this matter of choosing men — 
that is what brings this to my mind — I am (one of that number repre- 
senting the First Council of the -Seventies. There are constant changes 
in our councils, brought about through changes in other work of the 
Church — men are taken out of our quorums to serve as high councilors, 
bishop's counselors, and for other purposes ; and then the bishops of 
wards and presidencies of stakes recommend to us men to fill those 
vacancies. So we are all the time ordaining Seventies and setting apart 
presidents to keep these quorums intact as far as iwe can. All these 
men are recommended to us as good men, and the bishops believe that 
they are good men, and ,most of them are good men, but there are some 
of them [who have not proved to be very good. Some of these Elders 
who have been recommended to be Seventies, I do not know why they 
recommend them. : Out of the number some of them are very choice 
men, but other Elders that we ordain Seventies, it is the last time we 
see them, and then we are blamed for the condition of quorums. But 
of course the responsibility rests with us to labor with those men and 
make of them, through the blessings of the Lord, good men. 

Now this is the part I want to read, and I believe this. I may be 
of the old school, but I have heard it all pry life. I believe it in my 
heart and with my whole soul. If it is not true "then there is no truth, 
but we have been mistaken from our youth." We as a Church know 
this to be true: 

"And again, I exhort you, my brethren," — says Moroni, and this was about the 
last that he wrote — "that ye deny not the gifts of God, for they are many; and 
they come from the same God. And there are different ways that these gifts 
are administered; but it is the same God jwho worketh all in all; and they are 
given by the manifestations of the Spirit of God unto men, to profit them. 

"For behold, to one is given by the Spirit of God that he may teach the 
word of 'wisdom ;" 

What a wonderful gift ! 

"To another, that he may teach the word of knowledge by the same Spirit ; 

"And to another, exceeding great faith ; and to another, the gifts of healing 
by the same Spirit. 

"And again, to another, that he may work mighty miracles * * * 

"And again, to another, the beholding of angels and ministering spirits * * * 

"And 'all these gifts come by the spirit of Christ ; and they come unto every 
man severally, according as he will. 

"And I would exhort you, my beloved brethren, that ye remember that every 
good gift cometh of Christ." 

"And now, my beloved brethren, if this be the case that these things are true 
which I have spoken unto you, and God will show unto you, with power and great 
glory at the ilast day, that they are true, and if they are true has the day of 
miracles ceased? 

"Behold I say unto you, Nay." 

Says Moroni : 

"Wherefore, if these things have ceased, then has faith ceased also ; and 
awful is the state of man * * * 



20 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



"But behold, my beloved brethren, I judge better things of you, for I judge 
that ye have faith in Christ because of your meekness ; for if you have not faith 
in him then ye are not fit to be numbered among the people of this church." 

"And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things. 

"And whatsoever thing is good is just and true; wherefore, nothing that is 
good denieth the Christ, 'but acknowledgeth that he is." 

Moroni exhorts us that we deny not the gifts of God, for they 
are many and they come from the same God, and there are different 
ways and they are given by the manifestations of the Spirit of God 
unto men to profit them. j 

Notwithstanding all these great gifts, no man, however great, can 
lead, guide and direct the Church of [Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 
unless he is divinely authorized and appointed as the prophet, seer and 
revelator. 

"I exhort you to remember these things ; for the time speedily cometh that ye 
shall know that I lie not, for ye shall see me at the bar of God ; and the Lord God 
will say unto you : Did I not declare my words unto you, which were written by 
this man, like as one crying from the dead, yea, even as one speaking out of the 
dust?" 

Patriarchs tell me that prophecy is one of my gifts. It is only my 
gift through faith and through living up to the precepts of the Gospel 
of Christ. 

I have been told that I should prophesy. I want to say to you 
Latter-day Saints that to be a prophet of God all fear and all doubt 
have to leave your mind, and you then open your mouth and God gives 
you the words. But I have become so fearful about things I would 
be afraid to let it loose. I want ,to tell you there are |a lot of us in 
the same fix. Wie are afraid of what people will think and are doubtful 
about its fulfilment. 

When Heber C. Kimball prophesied that goods would be sold as 
cheap in the streets of 'Salt Lake as in New York, he himself turned 
to President Young land said : 

"Brother Young, I think I have made a mistake." 

Brother Young said : "Never mind, Heber. Let it go." 

Charles C. Rich, after the meeting, said : "Heber, I don't believe 
a word you said." 

Heber said: "Neither do I." (Laughter.) But he said: "God 
has spoken." And God had spoken. 

No wonder he was 'frightened, for the people were in the depths 
of poverty, a thousand miles away from nowhere. 

My testimony )to you is that those gifts and promises are the 
heritage of God's children. I am not a visionary man, I am not a 
dreamer. I sometimes wonder what my gift is. I have never seen an 
angel, but I have the assurance that comes to me and is burned in my 
heart .like a living fire by the power of the Holy Ghost, that God is the 
Father, that Jesus is the Christ. I believe with all my soul that Joseph 
Smith was a prophet and is a prophet of God, and God knows there is 
ample proof to substantiate it. I also believe that Heber J. Grant is a 
prophet of God, and whenever God gets ready to give him something

to tell you I promise you in the name of the Lord you will get it, and 
you will get it straight, too. 

The Lord bless you. Amen. 

PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 

First Counselor in the First Presidency 

Before concluding the services I desire to call your attention to a 
slight deviation that will be made in the ordinary proceeding on Sunday 
morning. Arrangements have been made that on each Sunday morning 
there will be a national broadcast of musical numbers from ithe Taber- 
nacle. On next Sunday we therefore request that you be present a few 
minutes before ten o'clock, when this broadcast will begin, and you will 
be entertained by it during the first thirty minutes, which will include 
the regular proceedings of the conference in part, after which the 
regular conference program will be continued. 

I make this announcement at this time because it is possible that 
some of you may not be here tomorrow and we would like if possible 
to have you all present before ten o'clock, or not later than ten o'clock, 
on Sunday morning, for the reason that during this broadcast which 
goes over the world it is necessary that the strictest attention be observed 
and that there be as little confusion and noise as possible. 

The hymn, "High on the mountain top," was sung by the congre- 
gation. 

Elder Joseph R. Shepherd, Patriarch, Cache Stake, pronounced the 
benediction. 

The Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock p. m. 

(AFTERNOON MEETING 

The second session of the Conference convened at 2 o'clock p. m., 
Friday, October 7. 

The congregation sang the hymn, "Now let us rejoice," after which 
Patriarch William H. Richards of the Malad Stake offered the opening 
prayer. 

The hymn, "How firm a foundation," was sung by the congregation.

22 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

GRATEFUL FOR BLESSINGS 

I do not know when I have felt happier >or more grateful for the 
blessings of life than ,1 jdo ,today. There are so many things for which 
we have reason to thank our Heavenly Father, this temple block with 
its unusually fine "buildings and beautiful flowers and shrubbery being- 
only one. When I realize that our people came from a land rich 
agriculturally, made their way across the great plains after being driven 
from their comfortable homes in Illinois, and came into this then desert- 
waste to build up /the Church to the glory of .God ; and as I observe how 
he has transformed the desert, I know that I for one have much to be 
grateful for. 

DEVOTION AND SACRIFICE OF THE PIONEERS 

Recently we traveled four hundred miles over a portion of the old 
pioneer trail, and stood |at the side of one grave containing bodies of 
fifteen of the members of ,this Church who gave their all for the cause 
and passed on to their reward, and hundreds of Others lie in unmarked 
graves. 

I have been on that trail over which barefoot, hungry and weary, 
in the cold of winter and the heat of summer, thousands of our people 
wended their way into this valley, buoyed up with the hope that they 
could here worship God according to the dictates of their consciences. 
Today when I think of this marvelous land in which (we live, this world- 
famed temple block, this edifice that has been dedicated to the worship 
of our Father in heaven, jit seems to me that we who are here ought to 
examine ourselves and check on our lives and see whether or not we 
are living up to our privileges and are worthy of that which the Lord 
has given us. He has said : 

"Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom 
of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Fa'ther which is in heaven." 

It was in order that we might know what his will is towards his 
children that he gave Joseph Smith, .the boy prophet, the latter-day 
revelation which .^resulted in the organization of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints. Then some of the very stalwarts of the 
earth were pricked in their hearts with a desire to know the truth, and 
the missionaries of the Church sought them among the nations, and the 
pilgrimage (to this western world began. The community comforts 
that we enjoy here are the result of their faith and devotion. 

RESPECT FOR THE NAME OF DEITY 

It is worth our while sometimes to just check over what the Lord 
said to the children of Israel through Moses when they were in the 
wilderness. I note that among the things he commanded them was 
this : 

"Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain : for the Lord will 
not hold him guiltless that take'th his name in vain." 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 



I hope that the members of this Church who have had the Ten 
Commandments and all the glorious truths of the Old Testament and 
the New Testament placed before them for their understanding, and 
have been instructed in our day by latter-day revelation — I hope, I say, 
that not any of these would be so thoughtless that they would take 
lightly upon their lips the sacred name ,of our Father in heaven. 

THE SABBATH DAY 

He also said: "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy." That 
seems such a little thing for !us to do in return for the blessings that 
we enjoy. But to forget that it is the Lord's day, as some of us appear 
to do, is ungrateful. He has set apart one day in .seven, not to make 
it a burden, 'but to bring joy into our lives and cause that our homes 
may be the gathering place of the family, that parents and children may 
assemble around the family hearth increasing our love for one another. 
And if we do what our Heavenly Father would have us do we will go 
to his holy house upon the Sabbath day and there partake of the sacra- 
ment in remembrance of the sacrifice that was made for us by the 
Redeemer of mankind. 1 

Honor, the Sabbath day and keep it holy, Latter-day Saints, and it 
will bring to you great joy and our Heavenly Father will bestow upon 
you the blessings that result from obedience to his advice and counsel. 

"HONOR THY FATHER AND THY MOTHER" 

He says further, "Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days 
may he long ,upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee." It 
seems to me that it ought not to be necessary to say anything of that 
kind to 'a. people like you who are sitting in this house today. Surely 
we honor our fathers and our mothers. Surely this people, above all 
other people in the earth, should jbe grateful for father and mother. 
Perhaps we know more than other people what it means to be blessed to 
come through a lineage, in this latter day, that has accepted the Gospel of 
our Lord and conformed their lives to its teachings. It is comforting to 
think of father and mother. Honor father .and mother ! Surely that is 
a privilege. It is one of the joys of my life when I feel that I have done 
something that will bring comfort to my father and mother. I felt that 
way when they were here and now that they have passed to the great 
beyond I would like to so order my life (that honor twill come to their 
names and;that when I meet them they will be glad to welcome me home. 

I think that (the Latter-day Saints should be stressing these admoni- 
tions of our Heavenly Father, teaching our children by example as well 
as precept that it is a privilege to honor the Sabbath day and keep it holy, 
that it is a real blessing to honor our fathers and mothers, that in /this 
day when the world is so depressed — in a day when people are tempted 
to do things that perhaps they would not do under other circumstances! — 
it is wise for us to- remember what the Lord has said and to read these 
Ten Commandments. I will not read them all, but I shall refer to one 
or two others.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



THE SACREDNESS OF .HUMAN LIFE 

"Thou shalt not kill." Many people in the world ;do not seem to 
realize what a terrible crime it is to take human life. When they become 
angry, for justifiable reasons ^as they think, ,they do not hesitate to 
destroy human life. Sometimes a life is taken in order that money or 
property may be seized. And yet there /is no crime that a human being 
can commit that will so far |alienate him from the blessings of eternal 
life in the celestial kingdom as murder. No other crime is equal to it. 
I think that it is our privilege in this Church,to teach our children, while 
in their tender years and while they are growing up, the enormity of the 
crime of taking human life. I feel that our Heavenly Father would 
justify this people if we would stress, if I maybe permitted to use that 
term, in our homes and in pur chapels the sacredness of human life, 
and the seriousness and importance of living, and cause these boys and 
girls who are growing up to understand how terrible it would be to 
commit the awful crime of murder, so that they would not be tempted 
under any condition so to do. 

PURITY OF LIFE 

"Thou shalt not commit adultery." In our day it does seem to me 
that the people of the world have gone far astray. There are many 
who stand in high places who have forgotten the sacredness of pure 
living and who are forfeiting the opportunity God gave to them to 
increase their power for happiness in life and to give joy to others. 
They have surrendered their virtue in order to satisfy their passions, 
with the result that they cut themselves off from the companionship of 
the Spirit of our Heavenly Father and follow the tempter who seeks to 
destroy them. 

Latter-day. Saints, teach your children to Observe the moral law. 
wSurround them as by the arms of your love, that .they may have no 
desire whatsoever to partake of the temptations .to evil that surround 
them on every hand. I want,to say to you that there is something more 
for us to do than l to send them to Sabbath School, to Primary, to 
Mutual, and these other Organizations in the Church. It is important 
that we as their fathers and mothers shall teach them and 'not only teach 
them but train them in the pathway of our Heavenly Father, that they 
may understand the importance and seriousness of the things that 
confront them in life. 

What a privilege it is for parents to sit down in their own homes, 
surrounded by a family of Ipure boys and girls given to them by our 
Heavenly Father, their spirits begotten by our Father in Heaven ! 
What a joy it is to have them mingle together partaking of the blessings 
of our Heavenly Father and rejoicing in the companionship of his 
Spirit, and to have them so trained in their younger days that while 
developing to maturity they have maintained the purity of their lives ! 

PITFALLS OF THE ADVERSARY 

My brethren and sisters, I plead with you that with more earnest- 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 



25 



ness, with more thoughtfulness, more patience than ever before, you 
safeguard the rising generation from the pitfalls that the adversary 
has -laid for their feet. Many of our picture shows, radio programs, 
magazines, books, etc., are unfit for respectable communities, and unless 
we neutralize the influence of these things by wholesome teaching and 
environment, bringing to the youth the benefits derived from knowing the 
lives of good men and women, teaching them the virtues of the prophets 
and the meaning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, some of those whom we 
love may slip away from us, and when it is too late ,we will realize that 
we have been sleeping on our privileges. 

Let us (teach our children to be pure in their lives, to be upright. 
Teach your boys to safeguard the virtue of their sisters and their girl 
companions. Teach your daughters to safeguard the virtue of the boys 
they associate with by restraining them from taking too many liberties 
in this, day when so many liberties are considered proper. 

I am talking to you, and through you I hope I am talking to those 
with whom you contact. It is not only our mission, to teach the ,Gospel 
of Jesus Christ and live it, but it is our mission to .send into the world 
our 'sons and daughters as they are called upon from time to time to labor 
in the ministry of the Church. As they go they Jshould have been .so 
trained that they would be adamant against the ,temptations of the 
adversary ; they should.- be as pure and (virtuous and righteous in their 
lives as it is possible to be, and then the influence of their very presence 
will be felt by those with whom they contact. The Spirit of God will not 
dwell in unclean tabernacles, but his Spirit will dwell with those who 
keep themselves clean and sweet. 

Therefore, let us major, if we may use that term, in rearing our 
boys and girls under the 'influence of the 'Spirit 'of God, that the adver- 
sary will have no power to lead them astray. 

"THOU SHALT NOT STEAL" 

"Thou shalt not steal," is another of the commandments. It is 
astonishing how many men and women who have always lived good 
lives will yield to temptation to take that which does not belong to them. 
For the 'past few years we have been passing through a change. There 
3eems to have been a letting down in the matter of honesty. Our 
Heavenly Father knew that we would need this commandment when 
he gave /it. It was not given just to be written into the scriptures and 
then laid upon the shelf. It was given to be iproclaimed upon the 
housetops, if need be. It was written that the Elders might go among 
the people and call their attention to the sorrow and distress that would 
follow the taking of that which does not belong to them, when they do 
it without permission. 

"Thou shalt not steal." This commandment was given to ancient 
Israel and punishment was ;meted out to those in that day who were 
dishonest. It is binding upon us today and I want to say to you that 
the punishment that is meted out ,to those who are dishonest in our day, 
when they are apprehended and haled before the courts of the land 



26 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



and punished for their crimes, is insignificant when compared with the 
spiritual punishment that befalls ,us when we transgress the law of 
honesty and violate that commandment of God. 

THE REPUTATION OF OTHERS 

"Thou shalt pot bear false witness against thy neighbor." Within 
the last few days I had brought to my attention what appeared to me 
to be a serious violation of this law. A great and good man who has 
sacrified much in the world to bless mankind, and has been helpful to 
many people, had his character assailed and his name was bandied 
around upon lips of individuals unworthy to be his companions. They 
did it to gain selfish advantage. They whispered falsehoods about him 
hoping to injure his reputation and in some way benefit themselves. 
Of course in due time they must atone for their injustice and be 
humiliated for they cannot escape retribution. 

"Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor" is in the 
same category as the other commandments our Heavenly Father has 
given to the children of men. I hope thatinot any of the members of 
this Church would stoop to injure the reputation of any soul because 
they had some object to gain. I hope that we would not accept lightly 
a reproach or unkind word from one individual about another and pass 
it on in the community to the detriment and harm of a good man or a 
good woman, or to the detriment of a bad man or a bad woman, if it 
be not true. I think that this community ought to be setting an example. 
T think that the Elders of this Church ought to honor their place among 
the people, and when there is a disposition to criticize, find fault and 
malign and misrepresent those who are seeking to do good in the world, 
not remain silent and be cowardly, because it does seem to me that is 
what it amounts to sometimes, but in the courage and majesty of the 
spirit of our Heavenly Father we should restrain in a way 'that will 
bring to their senses those who go about viciously misrepresenting their 
fellows. 

"Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor." During 
the upheaval we are passing through, when there is so much uncer- 
tainty ''about the future there is great need for every good man and 
woman to hold as a precious gift the reputation of our fellows. We 
should cultivate a feeling and desire to bless and benefit our kind. It 
should be my privilege to restrain those with whom I may associate 
from speaking evil of others. ; I believe that when the Lord gave this 
commandment to ancient Israel he expected those of us who understand 
it to assist in making it effective and in restraining ,as far as possible the 
untruths that might be scattered abroad from time to time about those 
who 'are our associates. 

THAT WHICH IS THY NEIGHBOR'S 

The Lord says further, "Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house, 
thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife, nor his manservant, nor his 
maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything that is thy neighbor's." 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 



27 



In other words, our .Heavenly Father has given us this law. W e 
have a right to appreciate and enjoy to the full the things that come 
into our hands as a result of our own efforts. We have a perfect right 
to enjoy to the full these things that come to us in a temporal way, 
but just the moment that we begin to desire that which belongs to some- 
body else, just the moment we begin to look about to see how we might 
obtain that which is not our own and become covetous of 'that which 
belongs to our neighbors, just so soon do we forfeit the spirit of our 
Heavenly Father, and we have gone into the devil's territory and are 
in his power. 

KEEPING IN THE LORD'S TERRITORY 

A good man who was a counselor to President Brigham Young 
said upon one occasion, "There is a line of demarcation well defined. 
On one side of the line is the Lord's territory, and on ,the other side of 
the line is the devil's territory. If you will stay on the Lord's side of 
the line the devil cannot come over there to tempt you or to annoy or 
distress you. If you go onto the devil's side of the line just one inch 
you are in his territory, you are in his power, and he .will seek to draw 
you just as far from that line of demarcation, that division line, as he 
can, knowing that if he can keep you in his territory he has you in his 
power." 

Those who disobey these Ten Commandments of our Heavenly 
Father, no matter in how .small a degree it may be, have gone into the 
devil's territory, and it is time that we as members of this Church, 
living in this day and age of the world, should understand that. No 
man can do that which is ,wrong and stay on the Lord's side of the line. 
No man can violate the Word of Wisdom and be on the Lord's side of 
the line. Wle choose where ,we will be. God has given us our agency. 
He will not take it from us, and if I do that which is wrong and get into 
the devil's territory, I do it because I have the will and power to do it. 
I cannot blame ,anybody else, and if I determine to keep the command- 
ments of God and live as I ought to live and istay on the Lord's side of 
the line I do it because I ought to do it, and I will receive my blessing for 
it. , It will not be the result of what somebody lelse may do. 

FOR THE PROTECTION OF OUR FATHER'S CHILDREN 

Therefore, living in this day when there are so many temptations, 
the Word of Wisdom ought to be stressed among the people of this 
Church. Our Heavenly Father, knowing the calamities that would 
come upon the earth, knowing the evils and designs that would exist 
in the hearts of conspiring men, gave to us the Word of Wisdom by 
revelation and warned us and forewarned us of what would come to 
pass. It does seem that every attempt of the adversary has been made 
to neutralize the advice of tour Heavenly Father. I hope there are no 
members of this Church, who have been honored with the priesthood, 
who would in any way weaken the power of God to bless his children 
by seeking to place temptation in their way, or who would think it an 



28 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



insignificant thing to try to break down the barriers God has raised for 
the protection of his children. I hope that as men and women, with 
the knowledge that has been bestowed upon us, we will resist day by day 
with such power as we have the right to resist, every attempt of evil to 
break down and destroy the morals, the character and the virtue of our 
people, and the sons and daughters of God wherever they may be. 

The Gospel of Jesus Christ is the power of God unto salvation to 
those who believe and who obey its precepts. We have been better 
taught than the world. We cannot make the excuses of the world if 
we fail. How grateful I feel that I am this day in the midst of a group 
of men and women who desire first of all to honor God and keep his 
commandments. 

SERVANTS OF THE LORD 

I sincerely regret that our beloved President is absent from us 
because of illness, that Brother Ballard and Brother McMurrin are not 
with us for the same reason. Brother Widtsoe is in Europe in the line 
of his duty. The other General Authorities are all present. All these 
men are servants of the Lord and I can sustain them with all my heart. 

TO TEACH THE PEOPLE 

I am thankful to be associated with an organization that has 
provided so well for the teaching of its people. Only last night I 
attended a meeting of one of the finest groups of women that may be 
found in all the world — the National Relief Society of this great 
Church — and what power they possess to carry forward their depart- 
ment of the work of our Heavenly Father. Then we have Sunday 
Schools, Mutual Improvement Associations, Primaries, educational in- 
stitutions and genealogical societies. All these our Heavenly Father 
has given us to bring us to a knowledge of the truth, and oh, how wise 
we are to desire to know the truth, and to live up to the teachings of the 
truth when once they come into our lives. 

THE ATTITUDE OF THE EVIL DOER 

This day from the depths of my soul I thank my Heavenly Father 
for my membership in his Church. I thank him for the warning that 
has come to me through the revelations that have been given to this 
Church, and among them I am reminded of a portion of the 28th 
chapter of II Nephi, indicating the attitude of the evil doer, which I 
read as follows : 

"And there shall also be many which shall say : Eat, drink, and be merry ; 
nevertheless, fear God — he will justify lin committing a little sin." 

Think of that — the suggestion that a little sin will be justified. 
Yet in the very first revelation contained in the Doctrine and Covenants, 
that which is known as the Preface, we find these words: 

"For I the Lord cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance." 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 



29 



Yet there are those who would say that because it is a little sin our 
Heavenly Father does not care. Continuing the .quotation from IT 
Nephi : 

"Yea, lie a little, take the advantage of pne because of his words." 

Think of what that means, the whisperings of ,the adversary to lie 
a little. Whether it be a lie intended to effect a religious organization, 
a business organization, a political organization, or an individual, the 
lie will brand the one who tells it, and sooner or later he will have to 
account for the wrong he .has committed. 

''Yea, lie a little, take the advantage of one because of his words, dig a pit 
for thy neighbor ; there is no harm in this ; and do all these things, for tomorrow 
we die ; ^nd if it so be that we are guilty, God will beat us with a few stripes, 
and at last we shall be saved, in the kingdom of God." 

That is what the adversary of righteousness is saying to the chil- 
dren of men. That is what Lucifer who goes .about defiling the people 
is breathing into their souls. That is the kind of doctrine that is being 
disseminated in the world by some of those who ought to be the leaders 
of morality and also of righteousness. But to you, my brethren and 
sisters, the obligation has been given that you must refute such things 
as these when you know of them. 

We read further: 

"Yea, and there shall be many which shall teach after this manner, false and 
vain and foolish doctrines, and shall be puffed up in their hearts, and shall seek 
deep to hide their counsels from the Lord; and their works shall be in the dark." 

THE CUNNING OF THE ADVERSARY 

And then further : 

"And others will he pacify, and lull them away irito carnal security, that they 
will say : All is well in Zion ; yea, Zion prospereth, all is well — and thus the devil 
cheateth their souls, and leadeth them away carefully down to hell. 

"And behold, others he flattereth away, and itelleth them there is no hell ; and 
he saith unto them : I am no devil, for there is none — and thus he whispereth 
in their ears, until he grasps them with his awful chains, from whence there is 
no deliverance. 

"Yea, they are grasped with death, and hell; and death, and hell, and the 
devil, and all that have been seized, therewith must stand before the throne of 
God, and be judged ,according to their works, from whence they must go into 
the place prepared for them, even a lake of fire and brimstone, which is endless 
torment." 

That is the word of a prophet of the Lord, spoken hundreds of 
years ago of what would exist in the world, and I bear you my witness 
today, my brethren and sisters, that that is a condition that does exist 
in the .world in the day and age in which we live. And as your brother, 
I plead with you that in the dignity of your membership in the great 
Church of the Lamb of God you resist the insidious temptations of the 
adversary and that in your homes and elsewhere you teach and exem- 
plify virtue and righteousness. See that the teachings of the Lord are 



30 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



so disseminated that every ,soul that comes within your portals will enjoy 
the blessing that is the result of the companionship of the Holy Spirit. 

OUR RESPONSIBILITY 

I know .this is God's work. I know the adversary is awake ; his end 
is drawing near and he is putting forth every effort in every conceivable 
way to blind the eyes of the children of men. Therefore, ,watchmen 
upon the towers of Zion, see to it that you do not shirk your responsi- 
bility. See to it that you do not turn aside from the opportunities that 
our Heavenly Father has placed in your way to be helpful. Let us 
go forward loving our fellows always desiring their uplift and blessing, 
carrying the Gospel message in such a way that the adversary shall 
have no power to stay it. And then in the end, when life is completed 
and we stand in the presence of our Father in heaven, may, we because of 
the work we have accomplished and our devotion to our Father's 
children, receive from him that glorious welcome home, "Well done, 
thou good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few 
things, I will make thee ruler over many things. Enter thou into the 
joy of thy Lord," I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS 

Of the First Council of Seventy 
''Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish." 

We have just listened to a splendid discourse on the gospel of 
repentance by Brother George Albert Smith. The whole world must 
repent or they shall perish. It is of universal application. It applies 
to you, and to me, and 'to every living soul. 

"Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish." 

That is sometimes referred to as the law of carnal commandments 
— the law of the Lord with reference (to our moral lives. It is the law 
by which we can liberate ourselves from the bondage of sin. It must 
however be supplemented by that higher law, the law of grace, the law 
of the Lord Jesus 'Christ. In the law it is written: "Thou shalt not 
commit adultery." In that higher law it is written that whosoever looketh 
on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already 
in his heart. We must watch and pray, and eliminate from our beings 
these elements of sin with which humanity is afflicted. 

If there be any man who thinketh himself .without sin he deceiveth 
himself and the (truth is not in him. A Pharisee came to the Lord at 
one jtime and paid : "Good Master, what good thing shall I do that I 
may have eternal life?" The answer came from the Lord : "Whycallest 
thou me good?" 

This universal law of practicing repentance from sin is a principle 
of progress, (of eliminating (sin and sanctifying our hearts from all 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS 



31 



unrighteousness. Let no one think that he has no further need of this 
saving principle of repentance from sin. ] i 

The great difficulty with which our missionaries meet in the world 
is the feeling that (people have that "you do not need to come and preach 
repentance to us, we are already Christians." It is the right principle 
of life to practice faith in God and repentance from sin as a means of 
progress. We need it. Every day we have occasion to apply these 
principles to our individual lives. They [have to do with everything 
that we have anything to do with. Every business transaction, every 
political scheme, every transaction of our lives, ievery amusement and 
everything that we engage in. We have need to apply these principles, 
for the simple ^reason that there is a right way and a wrong way to do 
everything, and jit is incumbent upon us to eschew the things that are 
evil, and that is an obligation jthat has rested upon mankind from the 
very day that our first parents partook of the tree of knowledge of good 
and evil and our minds were awakened to a sense of what is right and 
wrong. 

As this young man, the Pharisee to whom I have alluded, persisted 
in his question as to what good thing he should do in [order to obtain 
eternal life, the (Savior replied by quoting the 'commandments as 
Brother George Albert Smith has quoted them here today. He said — 
this Pharisee — "All these things have I kept from my youth up; what 
lack I yet?" And Jesus said unto him: "If thou wilt be perfect, go 
and sell that thou hast, and give Jo the poor, and thou shalt have treasure 
in heaven ; and come and follow me." 

That was the word — the higher law applied as well. The Savior did 
not do away with that lesser law, the law of carnal commandments ; 
those commandments are still in vogue and apply [to every creature. 
But those who comply with the higher law live above the law of carnal 
commandments, with jail the penalties attached. The principle of 
love supercedes the other : "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God, with all 
thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength ; and thou shalt 
love thy neighbor as thyself. These constitute the law and the prophets." 

What man 'will jdo ian injury to his neighbor, steal his property, 
take his life, or desire his wife? Not one who loves his neighbor as 
he loves himself, or if he loves God with all his heart. 

So, my brethren and sisters, we who have entered into covenant 
with the Lord and received that higher law ; let |us live above the law 
of carnal commandments and render obedience, not in fear of the 
penalties which are attached, (but out of (the love of God and the love 
of our fellowmen, which will sanctify and purify our hearts from all 
unrighteousness. Let us not think that we are (good enough just as 
we are, for we can go on /to perfection |by the application of these 
saving principles ;which God has revealed, and it is his desire that his 
people should sanctify themselves from all unrighteousness. Hence 
this great work with which we are identified ; hence the sending of our 
missionaries to preach the Gospel to the people throughout the world ; 
hence the organizations of the Church in the stakes and wards of 



32 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Zion; hence our auxiliary organizations, all having for their purpose 
the sanctifying of our hearts from all unrighteousness. 

There is la condition in the world that needs to 'be corrected. What 
is that condition? The Prophet Isaiah said a long time ago, many 
thousands of years ago : 

"The earth is defiled under the inhabitants thereof, because they have trans- 
gressed the law, changed the ordinances, and broken the everlasting covenant." 

What is that everlasting covenant? It is the Gospel of the Lord 
Jesus Christ. Its ordinances have been changed, the covenant has been 
broken and the world lhas corrupted and defiled the earth upon which 
we live ; but the Lord desires that it shall be sanctified from all unright- 
eousness, as we read in the Doctrine and Covenants where it says in the 
88th section thereof : 

"And the spirit and the body are the soul of man. 

"And the resurrection from the dead is the redemption of the soul. 

"And the redemption of the soul is through him that quickeneth all things, 
in wnose bosom it is decreed that the poor and the meek of the earth shall 
inherit it." 

Why? Because they are humble, because they are meek and 
teachable. They will listen jto the glad tidings of great joy and be 
brought to repentance. But the proud and the haughty will not. This 
earth is to be inherited and inhabited by the poor and meek of the 
earth that are willing to do the will of the Father. 

"Therefore, it [this earth upon which we live] must needs be sanctified from 
all unrighteousness, that it may be prepared for the celestial glory." 

The destiny of this earth is to be sanctified from all unrighteousness. 
It is ito receive as we believe its paradisiacal glory. It is to be celestial- 
ized and the habitation of beings who are sanctified from all unright- 
eousness. That is the work of the ministry, for the purpose of sanctify- 
ing the hearts of the children of men, that this earth upon which we 
dwell may he sanctified. This earth that has been defiled under the 
inhabitants thereof must be sanctified from all unrighteousness in order 
that it may be prepared for its celestial glory. That is what is to come. 

But .will ithey all accept that? No. Then what will become of 
those who receive not this Gospel and do not sanctify themselves from 
all unrighteousness by the application of these principles of the Gospel 
of the Lord Jesus Christ, that new and everlasting covenant? What 
will become of them? ! They shall be swept off from the face of the 
earth, for the .time is coming when sin and Sniquity shall be banished 
from the earth and when righteousness shall prevail and predominate 
and cover the earth even las the waters cover the mighty deep. 

May we be numbered among those who have sanctified themselves 
from all unrighteousness by obedience to these principles that have 
within them the power of God unto salvation, I pray in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen.

ELDER BRYANT S. HINCKLEY 

President of Liberty Stake 

My heart is beating fast with nervous anxiety. I have been coming 
to this tabernacle a long time but this is the first time in my life that 
I have ever spoken in a general conference. 

No person ever enters this historic building without a feeling of 
solemnity. Standing here I am admonished of my own limitations, of 
my own weaknesses. It would be arrogant for pie to assume the role 
of an instructor. 

When I came this afternoon I observed for a short ,time the men 
who came in and took their places in the section assigned to Presidents 
of stakes. The brother who sat next to me said: "We have both 
lived to see one generation of men go and another rise to responsibility." 
That is true. I very well remember the first time my father brought 
me to conference with him. I remember the men who used to come to 
conference in his day — John R. Murdock of Beaver, Canute Peterson of 
Sanpete, William Paxman of Juab, Abram O. Smoot of Utah, Angus 
M. Cannon of Salt Lake, and men of that type. 

In those days there were few stakes. I remember those men well. 
All of that generation has passed and a new generation is here. 
They were interesting men, men of heroic mould, of great faith, of 
pronounced individualism, rugged men, but men of fine extraction. 
Many of them knew very little of what is symbolized by the three R's 
but they were educated. They were great men, made great by their 
experience, by the faith which warmed their hearts. They have gone 
and so have many of their problems. 

I remember in my father's home we did not even have an electric 
light when I lived with him. There was no plumbing in the house. 
We had stoves and cedar wood. I never heard a telephone in that house. 
He never saw an automobile, never went to a moving picture show ; 
he never heard the roar of an airplane or listened to the magic of the 
radio. 

I suppose if my father were permitted to return and survey just 
for an hour the agencies that are at our command — could see what we 
enjoy, I think he would say to me: "My boy you are living in the 
millennium." But we are not. We are not living in the millennium but 
the progress that has been made is tremendous. All of these wonderful 
things are commonplace to us now. The first time I heard the human 
voice over the air I thought the wonder and marvel of it could never 
become commonplace, but it has. 

The other morning I went into a farmer's house. The radio was 
turned on and I heard Lord Gainsborough speaking from London upon 
"International Peace," and I heard it with clearness. If I were to say 
to my father: "You can get in an airplane at your home in Fillmore 
and be at conference in Salt Lake in an hour," he would think it im- 
possible. His life was simple. He wrote very few checks and conse- 
quently he never had an overdraft. (Laughter.) He had to answer com- 
paratively few questions. When I (went to stake priesthood meeting 



34 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



they talked about roads and canals — things of that kind. We do not 
do that now. That was perfectly legitimate in that day. These men 
carried lover into the details of their daily life their religion. It was 
the thing that animated them, that inspired them, that permeated all 
they did. They were men of great faith. Very many of them knew 
the Prophet Joseph. They stood close to Brigham Young. There was 
never in their minds the shadow of a doubt. 

It is true that we live in larger houses and wear better clothes and 
eat finer food. But I need not tell you, my brethren and sisters, that 
if we ever forsake the plain and puritanic virtues to which they were 
committed our day will be a brief one. The machinery which my father 
used on his farm is largely obsolete. The furniture which he had would 
not bring much in a second-hand store, |but his religious practices are 
not obsolete. If they ever become so among those who bear his name I 
am certain there will be the element of travesty in it. These men were 
made great by their faith, and that same faith applied to this day will 
make their children great. 

I cannot think that Mormonism is all in the past, its achievements 
are not all in the past tense. The present tense requires its application. 

I remember some of the stories that I heard in those days — this is 
typical. In the settlement of Spanish Fork the original settlers were 
given a small piece of land, perhaps five acres each. ' Two young men 
from Scotland came there — brothers. One remained in Spanish Fork, 
the other moved away. The man who remained was given his allotment 
of land and, inspired by this possession, he worked with a zeal that 
made him forget all his troubles. He never knew when the sun went 
down, he knew that every stroke of his arm would bring something 
to him and to his household. As a result of his thrift he was able to get 
five acres more. One day the bishop said to him: "Here is William, 
he hasn't any land 'and you have ten acres." William was a shiftless 
sort of man. The bishop said to this Scotch brother: "I want you 
to give him five acres of your land." To appreciate this trial of faith 
please bear in mind his nationality. (Laughter.) He said to the bishop : 
"Well, I will think it over." He did. On a fine fall day like this he 
was plowing in the field. He had thought it over carefully. He said : 
"Whoa!" and the horses stopped. Standing there he said: "Joseph 
Smith was a prophet ; Mormonism is true ; let them have the land." 

Here is another one: A man had gone on a mission and left his 
wife and children poorly provided for. One bight when all of the flour 
had been used one of the children before going to bed prayed that the 
Lord would open the way so that they could have more flour. The 
mother listened to it and thought about it and got the inspiration. No 
sooner had the children gone to bed than (this woman discovered among 
her scanty belongings a little yarn and she went busily to work knitting. 
Finally she had a small pair of stockings knitted. In the morning she 
said to the boy : "Take these stockings and this bread pan over to our 
neighbor and see if he won't give you some flour in return for the 
stockings." The boy did so-and came back with the pan filled with flour.

I like that kind of faith. That is Ifaith hacked by works. They 
had to couple their faith with works in those days. Roads were not 
built just by saying prayers. 

I remember one time while traveling in the southern part of the 
state I saw a man with a thin, frail team of horses attached to a loaded 
wagon. He was sitting down at the base of a hill and was figuring on 
something. I said to him : "Lee, what are you doing ?" He replied : 
"I am trying to figure myself over that hill." Besides figuring it took 
muscle and energy to get over the hill. 

A man in Idaho told me this story. I like this also. He said: 
"You know we used to ford the Snake River here, and when it was high 
it was dangerous. Your uncle and another man had to cross the river. 
They had a light wagon and a small team and when they got in the 
middle of the stream it looked as if the thing would capsize, and one 
of them ( said, 'I want to pray.' The other man said, 'I prayed before I 
got into this stream. You get into the back of this wagon and hold the 
bedding in and keep this box balanced, and when you get on the other 
side then you can offer your gratitude." I like that quality of faith also. 

My brethren and sisters, 1 love the faith of my father. I am grate- 
ful to all the powers that have made possible the privileges and oppor- 
tunities that seem to have come unasked to me. When I review jmy own 
insignificant life I cannot help thanking that if there is a modicum of 
patriotism in my blood I owe to this cause the best I have got. It 
meant much to my father, it has meant much to me. 'God help me to 
be true to it. I have never been on a (mission. Many of you brethren 
have been on missions ; but I cannot help thinking that the most effective 
way of preaching Mormonism is to 'live it at home. Mormonism, like 
everything else, must be measured by its fruits, and whether we will or 
not the lives of the plain men and women all down the line must be the 
gauge by which its power and efficacy will be measured. The way to 
preach Mormonism is first to live it and to build up within one's self a 
victorious and triumphant personality. Somehow when a man is grap- 
pling with his own weaknesses, when he garnishes and sweeps his own 
soul he gathers strength, an indefinable strength that comes from no 
other source. You never saw a Latter-day jSaint who was vitalized by 
the spirit of the Almighty who was afraid. 

I have this ion my desk so that every morning when I come to my 
office I can see it, this statement of the Savior recorded in the fifth 
chapter of Mark — five simple words: "Be not afraid, only believe." 
If every Latter-day Saint will cherish those words we can easily weather 
every storm and rise triumphantly over every circumstance. All we need 
is the faith of our fathers burning within our own souls and we will 
carry on. 

God bless the men and women who are here who represent the 
faith and leadership of this great Church. The Almighty must have 
confidence in you or he never would have called you to this high place. 
May his spirit sustain, inspire and bless you to constant and heroic 
endeavor in defense of this cause, I pray in the name of Jesus. Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ELDER JOSEPH F. MERRILL 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

Brethren and sisters : Some months ago I attended a conference 
in one of the stakes of the Church at which a returned missionary, in 
making a report of his missionary labors, said the greatest handicap 
to the progress of the work in the district where he last labored was 
the "Mormons" who lived there. Of course this statement seemed 
strange until he hurriedly explained that certain people who had been 
reared in the Church, but later departed from its teachings, moved into 
the district and lived so offensively from the standpoint of good morals 
and righteous conduct that others, seeing the evil deeds of these so- 
called "Mormons," were turned against anything "Mormon." 

The young missionary went on in his address to stress the value of 
right living by professed believers as a means of helping the spread 
of the work of the Lord. 

TEACHING BY EXAMPLE 

Of course he was right in his statement that we may teach more 
effectively "by example than by precept." We remember the words of 
Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount when he said, "Let your light so 
shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your 
Father which is in heaven." And as we read in the First Epistle of 
Peter (2:12) "Having your conversation honest among the gentiles: 
that, whereas they speak against you as evil doers, they may by your 
good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of 
visitation." 

Undoubtedly Peter had in mind, when he wrote these words, the 
teachings of his Master when he said, "By their fruits ye shall know 
them." Possibly the gentiles among whom the returned Elder worked 
may also have remembered these words of Jesus and were applying 
his measuring stick to the so-called "Mormons" in their midst. 

But I need not argue the point. To call it to your attention is 
wholly sufficient. Perhaps there is nowhere a people who accept more 
literally than we do the doctrine taught by John the Revelator "that 
they were judged [in the resurrection] every man according to his 
works." This doctrine is one of our fundamentals. 

NOT GOOD LATTER-DAY SAINTS 

But I sometimes wonder if we are not inclined to forget it just as 
we are subject to forget so many other things. We occasionally sec 
persons who appear to be devout, sincere believers, who profess to 
be Latter-day Saints, who have read and can quote much scripture and 
yet who, judged by their fruits, fall far short of a good Christian 
standard. They are slow "to do unto others as they would have others 
do unto them." They are not generous, they are not honest. Their 
word is not as good as their bond. They are not loyal to their professed 



ELDER JOSEPH F. MERRILL 



37 



principles. Their lives, in a measure at least, are only a sham and a 
hypocrisy. Now, of course, such people are not good Latter-day Saints. 

PEOPLE WHO CAN PAY BUT WILL NOT 

I sometimes think that a dishonest person should not be fellow- 
shipped in the Church until he repents. A person who can and will not 
pay his bills, for example, cannot be accepted of God, and therefore 
cannot have the companionship of the Holy Spirit. I am led to say 
this because, if we are rightly informed, there are people among us 
"who can pay but will not." They are taking advantage of the situation 
that makes it impossible for many honest people to pay their debts 
and because these cannot, the others conceal their own conditions and 
will not. I hasten to say, however, that I believe the faults of which 
I complain are by no means general. That they do exist all too 
frequently, however, all experienced people will testify. Ask doctors, 
dentists, and other professional people in Salt Lake City. They have 
had experiences that try their faith in the honor of many so-called 
"good people." Dishonesty is one of the sins of which those who are 
guilty are called to repent. 

THE WORD OF A "MORMON" 

Some of you, perhaps, have heard President Grant relate the story 
of a manufacturer in the Middle Wfest who rode up to a street meeting 
that our missionaries were holding in a city of Indiana and gave the 
crowd an oral character certificate of the Latter-day Saints. This was 
many years ago. He told the meeting that the word of a "Mormon" was 
as good as his bond, that his company had done many thousands of 
dollars' worth of business with the "Mormons" and had never lost a 
dollar. It would be extremely creditable to our people if such a 
statement could be truthfully made of us today by all who do business 
with us. But I have no hesitancy in saying that real Latter-day Saints 
have as much financial honor today as they ever had. They accept as 
truth the declaration of one of Shakespeare's characters that : 

"Mine honour is my life; both grow in one: 
Take honour from me, and my life is done." , 

Any man who fails in honor fails to the same degree in being 
a Latter-day Saint. His life is not as a light set upon a hill that attracts 
others to works of righteousness. 

But let every person realize, however lowly or unimportant he may 
feel himself to be, still he is not without influence for good or for ill. 
He is accountable to God for his influence. He is called upon to be 
"honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous," and to do good to all men. 
No one in the Church, no matter what his condition, is exempt from 
living these requirements. No one in the Church, therefore, is exempt 
from living the "golden rule." 



38 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



OUR RESPONSIBILITY AS CITIZENS 

Now there is another article of our faith, the 12th, to which I desire 
to call your attention. 

"We believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers and 
magistrates, in obeying, honoring and sustaining the law." 

In the light of this declaration every real Latter-day Saint is a good 
citizen. He is loyal to civil authority, an observer of law, a supporter 
of those who make and enforce the law. But this is not all. Good 
citizenship requires something more of a person than to be loyal to 
authority and to be law-abiding. 

We are living under democratic forms of government. This puts 
certain responsibilities upon the shoulders of the citizens, upon those who 
enjoy the privileges of the franchise. The voters elect the officers, those 
who make, interpret, and execute the laws. The government will, 
therefore, be good or bad depending on the character, wisdom, ability 
and efficiency of its officers. To have a good government we must have 
good officers, and to have good officers the voters must do their duty. 
They must enter politics, that is, take an active part in all those forms, 
processes and functions needful to elect and stand by and support 
good officers. 

The government cannot be left to professional politicians to elect 
themselves and to rule in their selfish interests. If this were done the 
people would suffer from unjust laws, unjustly and oppressively ad- 
ministered. Experience abundantly testifies to this truth. 

KNOW THE TRUTH AND FOLLOW IT • 

Now, if a citizen is to do well his part in securing good government 
he must be well informed on public questions and problems. The 
Prophet Joseph Smith taught that man cannot be saved in ignorance and 
that the glory of God is intelligence. These are fundamental doctrines 
with us. Hence to please our Father in heaven, we must continually 
strive for wisdom, knowledge, intelligence — we must keep growing in 
God-like attributes. 

Can we vote intelligently and wisely unless we are informed on the 
questions and candidates at issue ? But does not good citizenship require 
us to vote in this manner? I think so. We then should make a 
careful study of these questions, study them open-mindedly and as fully 
and deeply as circumstances will permit. To do this we must not be 
bound by a spirit of partisanship. Principles and policies should guide 
us rather than self-seeking politicians. We should follow the truth 
rather than deceptive propaganda. 

But how shall we know the truth? Learn all the facts pertaining 
to the case, interpret them fairly, justly, truthfully, and with a sincere 
desire to be wise and to act for the best good of all, at least for the 
majority. Then we shall not be far from the truth. Good citizenship 
requires that we shall not be carried away from a safe anchorage by 
misleading propaganda, fostered by selfish interests. 



ELDER JOSEPH F. MERRILL

MISLEADING PROPAGANDA 

Let me illustrate : During the past several months and particularly 
in the Chicago conventions in June of the national political parties the 
liquor question occupied a prominent place. As I see it, this was the 
result of an intensive campaign for the repeal of the Eighteenth 
Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. And for a 
number of years this campaign has been gathering strength until today 
it has attained mighty proportions. That it has acquired the character 
of misleading propaganda I must believe. Do you ask for my reasons 
for so believing? I will give you a few of them. 

One evening last May when I was passing through Butte, Montana, 
I read in an evening paper that the head of the Montana division of 
the women's organization for national prohibition reform "appealed to 
the women of Montana to join and support the organization in its efforts 
to restore law and order, to safeguard the homes and family ties in 
the nation through prohibition repeal. * * * The direct objects of this 
women's organization," the state leader announced, "are the closing up 
of speak-easies, the abolition of gin mills and roadhouses ; putting the 
bootlegger out of business, taking the profits out of crime, and the 
restoration of respect for law." 

All of them are perfectly worthy objectives and undoubtedly all 
good people will stand for them. But behold the means by which it is 
proposed to attain them ! Did you ever hear of anything more deceptive ? 
Yet many accept this propaganda, convinced that the objectives and 
the means are as logically connected as are cause and effect in the 
natural world. Of course this particular propaganda takes account of 
two facts. First, that people in general are very forgetful, and second, 
that millions of voters in America had not yet reached the legal voting 
age when national prohibition went into effect. From observation and 
personal experience they know little or nothing of the old saloon days 
and the almost intolerable evils, linked with, and attendant upon, the 
liquor traffic. And people are forgetful, very forgetful. Many of the 
older people now favoring the repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment 
seem to have forgotten the old conditions, and knowing that conditions 
today relative to liquor drinking are not so good as they ought to be, 
appear to be ready to "jump from the frying pan into the fire" as a 
result of the repeal propaganda. 

Among other things it is said that repeal will bring back prosperity, 
reduce crime, stop racketeering and do many other very desirable 
things. Experienced, as well as informed, people all know that repeal 
will make all these matters worse, much worse, instead of better. But 
in times like these any propaganda that promises relief from present 
ills appears to many as does a straw to a drowning man — a safe support 
or a secure anchorage. Hence the condition of the times produces the 
very atmosphere in which wild propaganda of various kinds flourish. 

MOTIVATED BY SELFISHNESS 

Let me give another illustration of the tendency of the times, that 



40 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



of more and more people to climb on the financial back of the govern- 
ment or of some other supporting organization. That relief is, and 
has been, absolutely necessary in thousands and millions of cases we 
have no reason to doubt. But in some cases, we must believe that 
demands for relief, at least to the extent it has been demanded, were 
unjust or contained elements of unfairness or selfishness. The Federal 
treasury has been the destination of countless raids inspired by selfish 
motives. And right now are we sure that selfishness does not motivate, 
in part at least, the amount of help that is being requested of the Federal 
treasury? But these are loans, you say, and surely no one will borrow 
more money than he really needs. Well, the relief extended by the 
Federal government last winter through the Red Cross was not a loan. 
Did selfishness inspire any individual requests for this aid? 

We all know that many people are in trouble at the present time 
because they borrowed, or at least borrowed more than was really 
necessary. Are some people trying to borrow Federal money today with 
secret suspicions or hopes that the loans will never be repaid? Are 
motives for borrowing wholly good? 

Brethren and sisters, for many years Latter-day Saints have been 
warned from this very pulpit against going into debt, and if they were 
in debt they were advised to get out of debt as soon as possible. May 
it not be that many of us are now suffering because we neglected this 
divinely inspired advice? Shall any Latter-day Saint continue the 
practice of borrowing unless, indeed, it is really necessary? 

SEEKING GOVERNMENT HELP 

But to return to our point — that of seeking help from the gov- 
ernment, whether it be a local or national government. This search, 
of course, takes many forms. That governments in times like these 
(and in certain cases at all times) ought to give the help needful to 
keep people from suffering for the necessities of life, I do not question 
at all but think it entirely proper. I said there are many raids upon 
public treasuries. Do you believe this? If so, what are you going 
to do about it? We cry "reduce expenditures, cut down taxes." Yes, 
we are all in favor of doing these very things except when it appears 
that doing them will adversely affect us. Then we face about. "Do 
it to the other fellows but not to us," seems to be our attitude. Many 
illustrations might be given but time will not permit me to do it. You 
can all name them yourselves. 

"Soak the rich" is a popular cry, appealing to the unthinking 
multitudes who seldom stop to analyze it from the standpoint of right 
and wrong and to reason out what the consequences of such a policy 
would be. I refer to this cry as another propaganda that a good citizen 
and certainly a Latter-day Saint should carefully examine before ac- 
cepting or having anything to do with it. 

LIVE BLAMELESSLY BEFORE THE LORD 

In these brief moments I refer to a few only of the propagandas 



ELDER JOSEPH F. MERRILL 



41 



with which the country is being flooded ; and I do this for the purpose 
of urging all with whom I may have influence to live blamelessly before 
the Lord. To do this requires, I believe, that we shall be true and 
loyal to our respective governments, as well as to the Church of 
Christ, of which we are members. Membership in each organization 
carries duties and obligations. And to discharge these satisfactorily 
for our best good and for the best good of our fellow men and acceptably 
to God must we not be clear-headed, thoughtful, studious, well-informed, 
fair, just, unselfish, and have a love for God as well as for man in 
our hearts? 

NOT THROUGH THE WISDOM OF MEN 

We are living in critical times. If there was ever a period during 
my life when we needed to pray I think it is now. Who is wise 
among us? Is it not written that "the wisdom of their wise men 
shall perish?" Of what people and of what period of time did Isaiah 
make this prophecy ? There is none wise among us except as the Lord 
shall inspire him. It shall not be the wisdom of men that will bring 
back peace and prosperity to this nation but the righteousness of the 
people following the lead of men whom the Lord will graciously inspire. 
All you who hear these words please do not forget them. And so read 
again and again I beg of you, the message that God gave to this people 
and to the peoples of the world through his servants, the Presidency 
of this Church, in their Christmas Greetings, published in the Deseret 
News, Dec. 19, 1931. 

To all who hear my voice and to whom these words shall come, 
may I send an appeal that you will try to be loyal and true to your 
government and live righteously before the Lord. May our Heavenly 
Father help us to do these things, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

ELDER SAMUEL O. BENNION 

President of the Central States Mission 

I bring you greetings from the Saints and missionaries in the 
Central States Mission, who are loyal to the Church and who are work- 
ing, I think, as faithfully as could be expected. I am sure, my brethren 
and' sisters, that the work of the Lord is growing and though these 
times are trying the hearts of men and women both in the field and at 
home, I am positive that there is an increased faith found among the 
youth of Zion. 

I have had an opportunity to measure in a way the standards of 
the Latter-day Saints as I find them expressed through their boys and 
girls whom they send into the mission field. I am sure that faith is 
increasing and that the younger men who come out now, and the young 
women also, have a firm testimony of the Gospel. It is true that this 
testimony has to be developed, but when it is developed it becomes a 
power within them. It is inspiring to be associated with them. 



42 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Only today, by way of example^and I think I can mention it with 
freedom — I talked to a young woman whose sweetheart is in the mission 
field. When he first came into the field he had a severe trial, that of 
losing his mother. He felt as if he must go home. Later, he was 
tempted more than ever to return, because he was fearful of losing his 
sweetheart. She, however, wrote him that if he came home on her 
account it would be of no avail, for she would not want to receive him. 

To me that is another testimony to the faith and integrity of the 
youth of our people. That the Lord is blessing them, is manifested 
continually by the boys and girls who fill places in the field as mission- 
aries. 

We do not know just how much we are accomplishing in our 
work, but I bear witness that there is faith in the hearts of the children 
of men who have joined this Church in the mission field, and they are 
diligently performing their duty. Many of them are taking the place 
of missionaries in these times when we are not able to get the help we 
need, and in a way it is a blessing in disguise, for many men and women 
who ordinarily would not be found doing missionary work are active 
now in the preaching of the Gospel, in the holding of cottage meetings, 
in the holding of sacrament meetings, and in visiting branches of the 
Church in different parts of the mission. Where missionaries formerly 
had to do it the local people now are taking the responsibility of carrying 
on that part of the work, and as a result we find an increased faith and 
growth and a development such as we have never seen before. I am 
sure, my brethren and sisters and friends, we need have no fears if we 
do our part. I am just as sure as that I am alive that if I do my part 
the Lord will do his. I know that the responsibility of carrying this 
Gospel to the world depends upon the Latter-day Saints, under the 
direction of the Presidency of the Church and the Twelve and those 
who are associated with them. 

We have important work to do. Every man who has a position 
in this Church has his work to do, and I think that the Lord fills him 
with a desire, if he will seek for that desire, and gives him the inspira- 
tion, the wisdom, the vigor and the power to carry on the work. The 
Lord's purposes will not fail. I am not fearful in the least about it. 
I have never known, in all the years I have been in the mission field, 
a weakness in the Church of Jesus Christ; neither have I ever seen 
successfully assailed, either by word or pen, one of the principles of the 
Gospel which have been restored through the revelations of Jesus 
Christ to Joseph Smith. 

So the work of the Lord is positively established in the world. I 
take great pleasure in bearing my testimony to you that I know that 
this is the work of God. If I had time this afternoon I could tell you 
why I know it to be true. My brethren and sisters, if we will do our 
part, if we will fit ourselves, if we will be as clay in the potter's hands 
in carrying out the wishes of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, I have 
no fear. We cannot do anything without his help. It is his work, it is 
not ours. It is his Father's work. That is the testimony he bore when 



ELDER SAMUEL 0. BENNION 



43 



he was on the earth: "My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me. 
If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it 
be of God, or whether I speak of myself." 

That same challenge is in the world today. The Lord has estab- 
lished his Church in the earth in this day and brought the people unto 
this land to build up his kingdom and the great plan that he formulated 
in the beginning. He has to do it through his sons and his daughters 
under the direction of our Savior, Jesus Christ, and it could not be done 
in any other way. 

I know that the authority of the Lord Jesus Christ is placed in the 
men who hold the power of presidency today; I know that Heber J. 
Grant is at the head of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 
by divine appointment. I know that he was ordained to that calling 
as Joseph the Prophet was before him. If you will read the thirteenth 
chapter of Alma, third verse, you will find the authority for it. I know 
that the men he has selected to be associated with him in the Quorum 
of the Twelve, are men of God, and that in their hands the Lord has 
left his work. They conduct the affairs of the Church under the 
direction of the Lord Jesus Christ, and this work will be found growing 
stronger every day. 

May the Lord help us to sustain it by sustaining ourselves, I pray 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The congregation sang the hymn, "Come, come, ye /Saints." 
Patriarch Israel Call of the South Davis Stake closed the meeting 
with prayer. 

The Conference adjourned until 10 o'clock Saturday morning, 
October 8. 



SECOND DAY 



MORNING MEETING 

The Conference reconvened Saturday morning, October 8, at 10 
o'clock. 

President Anthony W. Ivins announced that the congregation would 
sing the hymn, "O ye mountains high." 

After the singing of the hymn by the large assembly, which nearly 
filled the great tabernacle and galleries, Elder Joseph Bennett, Patriarch, 
Salt Lake Stake, offered the invocation. 

The congregation sang the hymn, "Do what is right." 

ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 

Of \the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

We appreciate your attendance, my brethren and sisters and friends, 
at this conference. We welcome you. We thank you for your presence 
and feel that we need your faith and your help in considering the great 
questions which confront us as a people at this particular time. We 
are grateful for the beautiful weather that the Lord has given us for 
the holding of our conference. 

We regret the absence of President jGrant and of Elder Ballard, 
both of whom have recently undergone more or less serious operations, 
but we understand that through the blessing of the Lord they are both 
well on toward recovery. We trust that the prayers of the Saints will 
foe continued in their behalf and that the mercy of the Lord will be 
extended unto them, that they may soon be fully recovered. 

one way Of relieving distress 

I think perhaps some of the people have been asking the question : 
What is going to be said or done, during the conference, to relieve the 
distressing condition of the people in this time of (financial depression. 
Some references to these conditions have already been made and some 
important advice and counsel have been given. 

I should like to contribute something toward the solution of this 
great question : What can be done to help ? | I remember that in Pres- 
ident Ivins' talk in the first session of this conference, yesterday morning, 
he reported an increase in the work being accomplished in the temples, 
and X was reminded of a conversation which I had with a brother a 
few days ago, as I met (him on the street. He is a man about my age, 
whom I have known since we were boys together. He is living here 
in Salt Lake and is a hard-working man. He .volunteered to say that 
at the last conference we were reminded that there were a great many 
people out of employment ; that the temples could accommodate many 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 



45 



more people than were attending" the ordinance sessions there; that 
members of the Church who had employment, and Swho had work to 
be done in the temples, would do well to employ some of these faithful, 
unemployed members of the Church to work for them in the temple. 
He said that he felt that that instruction was given for him, and he 
began expending about $5.00 a month from his meager earnings, and 
up to the present time had spent about $75.00 along' that line. 

As President Ivins 'was mentioning yesterday the increase in at- 
tendance at the temples, I wondered to what extent that advice given 
six months ago had affected the Latter-day Saints, as it had this one good 
brother to whom I refer, and to what extent that action on the part 
of the Saints is responsible for the increase of work being done. 

For your information, in order to be more definite as to the increase 
of temple work, I will say that during the first six months of this year 
the endowment work performed in the Salt Lake Temple exceeded 
that of the same period last year by 22,956 endowments. The increase 
in number of baptisms performed ( for the same period was 20,330. I 
am sure this will be a real astonishment to many of the Latter-day 
Saints, especially those who are not themselves active in accomplishing 
this work. 

The advice given six months |ago is just as applicable today as it 
was then, and I hope that we will in this way try to alleviate the dis- 
tress of some of our brethren and sisters, hy employing them to do 
some of this kind of work (for us. That is one way of helping both the 
living and the dead and lis pure religion. 

THROUGH FAILURE TO OBSERVE COUNSEL 

There are different classes of misfortune that have come to our . 
people in what we call the financial depression. There is a class of 
people who depend upon others for employment. They have been in 
the habit of living up to their income or a little beyond. They are now 
thrown out of employment because of this condition of depression and 
are stranded and penniless, many of these not having homes of their own. 

We have been counseled and advised by the Authorities of this 
Church, from the beginning, . that we should try to live within our 
means and lay jup something for a rainy day, a time of sickness or other 
emergencies that might arise. Had this advice and counsel been heeded 
to the full by the members of the Church, much of the distress of today 
would have been avoided. 

There is another class of people who, a few years ago, were prosper- 
ing, having great demand, at good* prices, for their products, and they 
bought more land in order to make more money, perhaps to buy more 
land. At any rate, many of our brethren have been hired to the 
purchase of farms and ranches and stock that they were not prepared 
to pay for. In order to make what they would call a good purchase, 
many of them have mortgaged their home and ; the farm, which was 
until that time unencumbered and yielding them good return, in order 
to raise the money with which to make the first payment on additional 



46 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



lands or cattle. The times did not continue as they had been. The 
products were not bringing the prices fthat they were formerly bringing. 
In some instances there was a scarcity of water and a shortage of crops, 
and many of these people were placed at their Jwits' ends to know how 
to meet these obligations, where their home and farm were mortgaged 
and the additional farm or stock was also mortgaged. Some have 
struggled on and have gone to the limit of their resources in an effort 
to make these payments, and ,then finally have found that they were not 
able to meet their obligations, and have lost their home, their farm, and 
the annexed property. 

That represents a class, and they are numerous among us as Latter- 
day Saints. This condition could have been avoided had the advice and 
counsel of the Authorities of this Church, whom we sustain by our 
vote as prophets, seers and revelators, been heeded. They have counseled 
and advised that we do not run into debt ; that we avoid Speculation with 
borrowed money. We can now see the wisdom of that counsel and that 
advice. 1 

There is another class of people who, thinking to get rich quick, 
have speculated in stocks, in oil fields, in picture films, in dream mines, 
and many other fake .stocks and enterprises which they bave been 
advised against, and this to their sorrow. 

The Lord has said : "Whether it be by my own mouth or by the 
mouth of my servants, it is the same." These men are upheld, by our 
vote, as prophets of God, and as such we would do well to follow their 
advice and counsel. Had we done so as a people much lof the distress 
we see about us would have been averted. 

FROM A SMALL BEGINNING 

The Lord, in a revelation to the Prophet Joseph, known as the 
64th Section of the Doctrine and Covenants, says this: 

"Wherefore, be not weary in well-doing, for ye are laying the foundation of a 
great iwork. And out of small things proceedeth that which is great." 

Daniel's interpretation of Nebuchadnezzar's dream, as the Lord 
gave it to him, was that in the last days — that expression is used — in 
the days of certain kings also should the God of heaven set up a kingdom 
that should never be thrown down or be given to another people. It 
was likened iimto a stone cut out of the mountain without hands, that 
should roll forth until it should fill the whole earth. 

This Church and the Gospel constitute Mormonism, the biggest 
thing in this world, yet ,it had a very small beginning. We read in the 
Acts of the Apostles, where Peter, in addressing those Jews who were. 
I suppose, responsible for the killing of the Savior, said : 

"Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, 
when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord ; 

"And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you: 
"Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, 
which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world 
began." 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS

Everything pertaining to this Church and the Gospel is a restora- 
tion. 

FASTING AND OFFERINGS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED 

I desire to call your attention, 'brethren and sisters, to the tithes 
and the fast offerings. Fasting and offerings have been associated 
closely always. I will read to you a few words from Isaiah on this 
subject. He goes on to tell that the people's fasting was not acceptable 
and tells why. Then he says : 

"Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness, to 
undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break 
every yoke? 

"Is it not to deal thy |bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that 
are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; 
and that ; thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh? 

"Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thine health shall 
spring forth speedily: and thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of 
the Lord shall be thy reward. 

"Then shalt thou call, and the Lord shall answer ; thou shaft cry, and he 
shall say, Here I am." 

The offerings, according to Isaiah, are naturally a part of the fast, 
and help to make the fast acceptable to the Lord. We ought to get that 
fixed in our minds. Malachi associates the offerings with the tithes as 
follows (Malachi, third chapter) : 

"For I am the Lord, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not 
consumed. 

"Even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine ordinances, 
-and have not kept them. Return unto me, and I will return unto you, saith the 
Lord of hosts. But ye said, Wherein shall we return? 

"Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have 
we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings. 

"Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me, even this whole nation. 

"Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine 
house, and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open 
you the windows of heaven, land pour you out a blessing, that there shall not 
be room enough to receive it." 

FASTING AND OFFERINGS ESTABLISHED 

Tithes, offerings and fasting — a restoration in these days. What 
does it mean? In the early rise of this Church there was established, 
as a restoration, this principle of fasting and giving offerings for the 
poor. One day each month was set apart. The members of the Church 
were asked to abstain from eating two meals of the three which they 
are accustomed to having, and to give the value of what they would save 
by the fast, for the support of the poor. If we bad observed this fully 
and faithfully, brethren and sisters, there would have been ample in 
the Church, from that fund alone, to take care of all who are in need 
of assistance. 

IF STRICTLY OBSERVED 

Let us just see for a moment. The population of this Church is 
in the neighborhood of 700,000; we will say 600,000. If all of the 



48 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



members of the Church had observed fully and faithfully this advice 
and counsel from the beginning see what ,it would mean. Estimating 
the average value of a meal at fifteen cents, two meals a day, thirty 
cents; for 600,000 people, $180,000.00 a month. Think of it! Or 
$2,160,000.00 per year! We have not always been as populous as we 
are now, but had we observed that one obligation, all the poor would 
have been taken care of and there would have been an accumulating 
surplus for a time of emergency such as we are having today. It is 
a little thing out of which great things would come if we were doing 
our part. The Lord has planned it all right ; the failure is on our part. 

AN OBLIGATION UPON ALL 

So let us now, brethren and sisters, from this time forth observe 
the fast and the offerings. I realize (that in many of the wards and 
stakes there are but very few who are in need of help. In fact, a bulletin 
issued from the Presiding Bishop's office on the 30th of June, this year, 
gives the information that seventy-five of the one hundred and four 
stakes are maintaining their poor from the offerings. That is very com- 
mendable, but in many of those stakes -it requires but little to do this. 

Instructions have gone out from the Presiding Bishop's office 
endorsed by the First Presidency, asking the bishops in wards where the 
offerings are not needed for the poor, jto forward those offerings to the 
Presiding Bishop's office. I suppose that in many of the wards where 
there are very few if any poor, the people have ifelt that they did not 
need to give their offerings, perhaps they have not understood the plan, 
that a surplus of the ward offerings should be sent to the Presiding 
Bishop's office for distribution among those members of the Church 
who are in need. I am disposed not to find fault with the people on 
that account. Perhaps the bishops have not realized the full significance 
of this advice and have not stressed ^mong their people the importance 
of paying their offerings. The bishops ought to be more persistent in 
teaching the people, and the people more particular in observing this 
instruction. 

The Presiding Bishopric and the Presidency of the Church have 
instructed bishops that where the offerings are not sufficient to take 
care of the poor they are at liberty to make requisition upon the 
Presiding Bishopric for the privilege of using a part of the tithing for 
this purpose. It will no doubt surprise you, brethren and sisters, when 
I tell you that last year, according to their reports, $224,556.38 was 
drawn from the tithes of the Church for charity purposes. Is it 
important then that we observe our fast and our offerings, which would 
have obviated any calling upon the tithing fund for help ? 

IN REGARD TO TITHING 

It was reported here by President Ivins yesterday that the Church 
is out !of debt. That doesn't mean that there is no emergency and that 
we can let up on the payment of our tithes, brethren and sisters. The 
tithes are dropping off because of general adverse financial conditions 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 



49 



and the poverty of [the people. We do not ask those who have been 
and are full tithepayers, to pay more than a tenth of their interest and 
income. When they have done that they have done their full duty, so 
far as the tithing is concerned. But we do ask them to continue to pay 
their tithing as heretofore ; and those who have only paid part tithing, 
to pay their tithing in full ; and those who have paid no tithing at all, 
to repent and pay their tithes to the Lord. If we .obtain an exaltation 
in the kingdom of God we must observe and keep all the laws of God, 
and that includes ithe law of the tithe. 

DOERS OF THE WORD 

There are too many of us, I fear, who are of the class that the 
Apostle James had in mind when he said : 

"But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own 
selves." 

I feel, (brethren and sisters, that we as a people have need of being 
impressed with the necessity of doing as well as we know, perhaps more 
than of being taught what we ought to do. We are a well-taught people 
and fas a rule if we would do as well as we know all would be well with 
Zion. 

This is a great and glorious work. , The Lord said to the Prophet 
Joseph : "I am about to Ibring forth a great and a marvelous work." 
It is great. It is marvelous. It is a wonder. And yet, brethren and 
sisters, it would be very much more marvelous and very jmuch more 
wonderful if we were living according to the standards of the Church 
and of the Gospel, and the teachings rthat are given us by the leaders of 
this Church. . In doing this we would glorify the names of our Father 
and his Son, our Redeemer. 

There is, then, much that we can do to help to alleviate the distress 
and suffering that are among the people today. God has graciously 
made provision in his Church for every condition that might arise. 
It is for us to carry out his purposes according to his jplanning; then 
would the wisdom of the wise men perish, and the understanding of 
their prudent men be hid, [in the light of the accomplishment of this, 
God's work. 

May he help us to do our part faithfully and well, t pray, in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

DR. FRANKLIN S. HARRIS 

President of Brigham Young University 

I do not think it would be possible for anyone to be more surprised 
than I am this morning upon being called to address you. I have 
enjoyed very much the meetings of this conference; I always enjoy 
these meetings. For, something like twenty-nine years, the period 
that I have been accessible to the conferences of the Church, I have 
never missed one if I have been in the state, and it seems to me that 



50 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



each of these conferences has its own peculiarities, its own type of 
advice, counsel and admonition. I should not like to be without the 
inspiration that comes to me by attending these meetings. 

In these days, when everything of the past is being brought up 
for review, our religious activities, our Church, and everything else, 
come in for consideration. Recently in the East, I read something 
that had been written by some minister in which he said that the old 
people of the Church were incurably "Mormon," but that the young 
people showed some hope of being alienated in their affections 'for 
the Church, and that there was hope that in time these young people 
would withdraw and become Christians. This set me to thinking, and 
since it is my work to be with the young people of the Church I believe 
I am prepared to speak on this subject with some authority. At the 
University I come daily in contact with about fifteen hundred of 
them from all parts of the Church. It is also my privilege [to travel 
throughout the Church and meet young people. 

I am prepared to refute, in the most emphatic terms, any allegation 
that the young people of the Church are not loyal to it, to its authorities, 
and to its teachings. Of course there are not one hundred per cent of 
the young people who continue to adhere to the Church. There are not 
i one hundred per cent of Americans who continue to be loyal to the 
government of the United States. There is no cause that has one 
hundred per cent support. But it is my firm conviction that there has 
never been a time, in the history of the Church, when the young people 
were so firmly rooted in the fundamental principles of the Gospel as 
today. 

Almost daily young people come to my office and tell me of their 
devotion to the Church, of their growing conviction of the truth of its 
doctrines, of their determination to spend their lives in its service and 
in advocating the doctrines for which the Church stands. There are 
those, of course, who have their periods of doubt, and I do not blame 
them for their doubts, because after all the knowledge of another 
person cannot save an individual. It is necessary for a person to think 
the thing out for himself. He must have doubts and misgivings in 
order that those doubts and misgivings may be overcome and that he 
may get a philosophy of his own. Consequently I never worry if a 
young man or young woman expresses some doubt and wants to think 
the thing out for himself. I know that this type of real thinking is a 
thing that will eventually bring them back to a loyalty to the Church 
and an understanding of its principles. 

The thing that I do object to is the lack of interest. This it seems 
to me is the most dangerous thing we can have, and if I see a person, 
particularly a young person, who says he has no interest in religion, 
then I have misgivings. 

I want to bear my testimony to you that the Gospel of Jesus Christ 
contains those principles that are satisfying to. any thinking man or 
woman. I have no apology to offer for it. I believe that some of our 
people make a mistake by being somewhat apologetic for the Church, 



DR. FRANKLIN S. HARRIS 



51 



for its history, or its doctrines ; but as far as I am concerned, I have 
no apologies whatever to offer for it. 

It has been my privilege to see, more than most men, the peoples 
of the world, to study their philosophies, to observe their systems in 
practical operation and to know the hearts of the people ; and the 
more I study the rest of the world the more I love Mormonism. Not 
that I have anything against any people; I know of no people with 
whom I have come in contact for whom I do not have honor and whose 
point of view I do not respect; but knowing these other conditions I 
have greater love for Mormonism, for its leadership, for its doctrines, 
for its institutions, for what it can do for man here and hereafter. 

So when I come in contact with the young people I tell them to go 
about in their excursions seeking for truth. I say: Look it all over; 
investigate it all ; because I am not at all afraid of the results. I hope 
that we, as a people, do seek everywhere for truth. W!e have no 
monopoly on the truth. Theoretically we take it all from whatever 
source it comes. Other people have truth, and I believe that we should 
seek it far and wide, and adopt it wherever we find it. 

I bear testimony to you, my brethren and sisters, that the young 
people of the Church are entirely worthy of the confidence of their 
parents. I think they are the best young people the Church has ever 
had at any time, notwithstanding there are differences of opinion on this 
point. I believe the young people are the most temperate, the most 
moral, the most intellectual that the young people have ever been at 
any time in the history of the Church. I bear testimony to you that 
with the passing of each generation we shall have more loyalty to the 
Church, we shall have more consolidation and a stronger Church. 

I fervently pray that I may be worthy to be among the humble 
workers of the Church, that I may be able to set a proper example, 
and that I may assist in advancing this great cause. I ask this in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

Elder Herbert R. Bluke, assisted by the congregation, sang the 
hymn, "Galilee."

LAWLESSNESS, DISRESPECT FOR LAW AND ANARCHY 

Wlhile many of you may know that all my life I have been a 
Prohibitionist, that I stand firmly for the 18th Amendment, for its 
retention in the Constitution of the United States, and for the Volstead 
Act and for its enforcement, and while I have made a public announce- 
ment that if in our two great National parties men cannot be found 
for office who live in accordance with the laws of our country and 
who are in favor of having our laws enforced, I stand ready to join a 
third or fourth or any other party that favors enforcement, nevertheless, 



52 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



I feel as if it would be unwise and perhaps improper for me in the heat 
of the present great National campaign to make an extended argument 
in favor of Prohibition or the 18th Amendment since on these subjects 
honest, law-abiding, high-minded citizens have such greatly diversified 
views. 

NOT GOOD FOR MAN 

Speaking as I am to this great conference of Latter-day Saints, 
however, I cannot resist the temptation to quote these few words from 
the Doctrine and Covenants : 

"Behold, verily, thus saith the Lord unto you * * * I have warned you, 
and forewarn you, by giving unto you this word of wisdom," a portion of which 
reads, "Strong drinks * * * are not good for man." (Doctrine and Covenants, 
Section 89.) 

ALCOHOL A NARCOTIC 

Nor can I resist the temptation to add that the 18th Amendment 
came and in my opinion it and Prohibition also will finally prevail, 
because in this scientific age it has been demonstrated that alcohol is 
not a desirable food nor is it in any sense a stimulant, as was formerly 
believed. Science tells us it is a poison, it is a narcotic. It compels 
human nerves to tell falsehoods. It makes men think they are doing- 
more work when scientific measures show that they are actually doing 
less. It makes the poor man think he is rich, it makes the sick man think 
he is well. When the masses of the people are so educated that they 
know and understand the truth about alcohol as they now know that 
the earth is round and that vaccination is effective, then alcohol should 
be and I expect it will be avoided and will be prohibited with the same 
vigor and unanimity that the use of morphine is prohibited. The wise, 
the good, the ambitious, the educated people of the world will be too 
much interested in efficiency to have their own and their children's 
chances of success reduced by the use of this poison, this narcotic — 
alcohol. 

LOYALTY TO .EIGHTEENTH AMENDMENT 

If I were making an appeal to you on this occasion in the interest 
of Prohibition and the 18th Amendment I would draw your attention to 
the resolution passed last June by the Mutual Improvement workers of 
the Church, when, in their annual convention 10,000 strong and repre- 
senting 125,000 workers, they declared their loyalty to the 18th Amend- 
ment and to our Prohibition laws ; also pledged their support to officers 
and candidates for office who respect these laws, who live in accordance 
with them and who strive for their enforcement. I would draw atten- 
tion too to the statement on this subject by the General Boards of the 
Mutuals as it appeared in the September Era. It says : 

GIVING UP FOOD AND CLOTHING FOR DRINK 

"The M. I. A. has always stood and will continue to stand for the non-use of 
liquor. We believe and teach that it is not good for man. Alcohol strikes at 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 



53 



the very foundation of human progress. The M. I. A. helped to secure Prohi- 
bition and regards it as the most successful means yet tried or devised by this 
or any other nation for dealing with the liquor traffic. Laws are rarely one 
hundred per cent successful. Since the observance and enforcement of this 
legislation would mean that the laborers of our country would buy food, 
clothing, shelter and education for their families with the money that might 
otherwise be spent for drink, the M. I. A. stands strongly against repeal and 
strongly for the enforcement of our liquor laws. The ground already gained, 
which has cost so much in time, effort and money ought not to be lost, it ought 
not to be surrendered. Liquor has always been and it will continue forever to 
be the intimate ally of crime. Fighting the one is the surest way of decreasing 
the other. Let us struggle on and on and on. Since this enemy of the happiness, 
prosperity and success of mankind can never be completely eliminated, good 
citizens will always have it to fight." — General Boards Young Men's and Young 
Women's Mutual Improvement Associations. 

"we are at war !" 

But the subject upon which I desire to speak is lawlessness, dis- 
respect for law and anarchy. 

The condition of our country with respect to lawlessness and 
anarchy is such that John J. Pershing says, "We are at war !" that the 
conditions confronting the United States today are more serious than 
those we faced in France. (American Magazine, June, 1932, p. 15.) 

THE LAW BREAKER OF TODAY 

The law breaker of twenty years ago was a cringing, shabby, 
repulsive creature who shyly attempted to hide himself in alley ways 
and other dark places. But conditions have changed. The law breaker 
of today is wearing fine clothes, flashy jewelry, he owns and drives 
high-powered speed boats and high-powered motor cars ; his pockets are 
bulging with money. These are the racketeers, the gangsters, the boot- 
leggers and kidnapers, who, equipped even with machine guns, have 
such power, influence and financial strength that they are actually 
threatening the very life of our government ; they are undermining the 
foundation of our republic. Surely the citizens of the nation should 
be alarmed, they should be aroused when the very existence of our 
government is in peril. 

THE DRINKER IS RESPONSIBLE 

There are those who assert that Prohibition is responsible for this 
alarming condition. I deny it. It is not the law nor is it the bootlegger, 
but it is the buyer of liquor, the purchaser of drink, it's the one who 
furnishes the money that is responsible. Without the buyer, without 
the purchaser of alcoholic liquor, there would be no bootlegger, there 
would be no drinking, there would be no drunkenness. 

GUILTY PUBLIC OFFICIALS 

If we have weak, dishonest or criminally guilty public officials, 
perhaps the blame should be placed at their door. 

The statement has been made and it has been broadly circulated that 



54 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



the people of Utah actually elected and sent into our state legislature 
men who were and are themselves law breakers. You all know of 
course that the Prohibition law in Utah is a rigid one. In our state 
he who has liquor in his home or even in his hand or otherwise in his 
possession is a law breaker. Do you, do I, do we all realize the serious- 
ness of selecting and electing as our legislators those who themselves 
are breakers of this or any other law? 

BUYING VOTES WITH LIQUOR 

Can you imagine the people of Utah sending to the legislature men 
whose votes could be bought with a flask of liquor? I appeal to you 
with all the earnestness that I possess not to elect any of this sort to 
the legislature of the state of Utah or any other state on the 8th day of 
November next. 

What a reflection upon the state of Utah to have a lobbyist drop 
and break a bottle of booze on the floor of our legislative halls ! Imagine, 
if you can, how many of the votes cast by our legislators, by those whom 
you and I elected, were bought and paid for with illegal and 
unlawful liquor. 

FUNCTIONS WHERE LAW IS BROKEN 

For many years I have sent a personal questionnaire to those for 
whom I have had opportunity to vote asking candidates for public 
office to advise me confidentially or otherwise whether or not they live 
in accordance with the law, whether they favor the enforcement of 
the law, and in addition I have urged them if elected to join me in a 
resolution not to participate in any function, social or otherwise, where 
the law is broken. 

VOTE ONLY FOR THOSE WHO RESPECT THE LAW 

I appeal to you in this serious hour, when "we are at war," when 
the conditions confronting us are more serious than those we faced in 
France, to cast your ballots for those candidates only who are law 
abiding, who have real respect for the law and who want it enforced. 
If the people of the country generally will vote for law breakers, if they 
will elect such men to public office, then with certainty will government 
of the people, by the people and for the people vanish from the earth. 

REFLECTION ON STATE 

How serious is it to be an intentional, a premeditated, a flagrant 
and defiant breaker of any law? While for the average citizen to be 
such a law breaker is serious, for a legislator of the state of Utah to 
be thus guilty is unpardonable, it is a serious reflection upon the good 
name of the voters of this state. 

GOD HAVE MERCY ON US 

What strength, what value will there be in any law, even in that 
law which protects us in our property rights, if we degenerate to such 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 



55 



a degree that the law breaker has to be arrested by a man who is equally 
guilty of breaking the law ; that when he who is guilty is brought before 
the bar, that bar which is supposed to be a bar of justice, he has as his 
prosecutor a district, a city or a county attorney who is himself as 
guilty as the one he is to prosecute? What an unfortunate condition 
will prevail if we reach such a situation that the individuals who consti- 
tute the jury are as guilty of law breaking as is the man whose guilt 
they are expected to discover. And then finally, if in addition to. all of 
this, the judge or the justice who occupies the exalted place upon the 
bench does not himself have respect enough for the law to live in 
accordance with its provisions, God have mercy on us, for when this 
condition prevails government of the people, referred to by Abraham 
Lincoln, will surely be perishing from the earth. 

STAND FOR AMERICA 

I appeal to you now, during this heated political contest, regardless 
of party, partisanship or politics to stand for America ; to stand for the 
Constitution of the United States ; to cast your vote only for those 
who have the character, the manhood, the stamina to live the law ; 
vote only for those who when they take that sacred, that solemn oath 
of office which says that they will support, obey and defend the Consti- 
tution of the United States will have the honor, the integrity, and enough 
of the genuine spirit of America to live in accordance with that pledge. 
I appeal to you to vote only for those who really live in accordance with 
our laws and who, if elected, will do their best to have the law enforced. 

BY THE BLOOD OF THE REVOLUTION 

Brethren and sisters, citizens of America, I ask you to imagine 
yourselves standing by the Lincoln monument in Springfield, Illinois ; 
I ask you to imagine again that your feet are on the sacred soil where 
stands that glorious American shrine, the Lincoln Memorial; and 
imagine again that you are looking into the face of him who has been 
called our greatest American — Abraham Lincoln — and then listen to 
these, his words: 

"Let every American swear by the blood of the Revolution never to violate 
in the least particular the laws of the country, and never to tolerate their 
violation by others." * * * "Bad laws," said he, "if they exist, should be 
repealed as soon as possible; still, while they continue in force, they should 
lie religiously observed." 

"help me, o father!" 

That wise philosopher, that great American, Benjamin Franklin, 
offered this appealing prayer: 

"That I may be loyal to my prince and faithful to my country, careful for 
its good, valiant in its defense and obedient to its laws, help me, O Father!" 

SUSTAINING THE LAW 

"We [members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints] believe 
* * * in obeying, honoring, and sustaining the law." (12th Article of Faith.) 



56 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Listen to the words recently sent forth by the First Presidency of 
the Church and the Council of the Twelve: 

"* * * We do not hesitate to give the emphatic counsel that it is the 
unqualified duty of every citizen * * * loyally to support the 18th Amendment 
and the laws of Congress in relation thereto."— Improvement Era, Sept., 1932. 

I STAND WITH LEADERS 

I -stand with Lincoln and Franklin, with the Church and with the 
General Authorities for the enforcement of the law. I appeal to you 
and to all the people of the nation to come to the support of the 
Constitution of the United States, I appeal to you to stand with me 
when I say, "God helping me, I will not knowingly cast my vote for 
any candidate for any office unless I have reasonable assurance that he 
lives in accordance with the law, that if elected he will live in accordance 
with the sacred oath of office he will be required to take, and that he will 
do his best to see that all our laws are respected and that the people 
live in accordance with them." 

HIGH-CLASS CITIZENSHIP 

If ever the United States of America needed, if ever our country's 
conditions demanded, high-class citizenship, it is now, in this year of 
our Lord, one thousand nine hundred and thirty-two. I trust, I pray this 
need, this demand of the country for loyalty, for statesmanship, and 
for devotion to law and order will not be in vain. 

YOUTH SPEAKS 

This is an age, or perhaps it would be more accurate to say, this is 
the age of young men and young women. This is a time in which 
"Youth Speaks." If you desire to feel the pulse, if you desire to know 
the heart throbs of at least one of the young people of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, read in the Era, the organ of our 
young peoples' Improvement Association, for the month of October, an 
article written by George Albert Smith, Jr. Here is one of our Mutual 
Improvement workers who is but a boy fresh from college. I mention 
him as typical of the youth of the Church. As I speak he is on his 
way to Harvard to do work as a graduate student. He writes upon 
the subject, "Are You a Wet Dry or a Dry Dry?" 

DETERMINED YOUNG MANHOOD 

In every sentence you will feel the strength, the determination of 
his strong, youthful character, his noble manhood. ■ You will feel the 
deep and determined resolution which throbs in his breast. Like this 
excellent young man the great majority of the young people of the 
Church are struggling to live in accordance with the highest Christian 
ideals, to follow in the footsteps and to follow the example of those 
pioneers, great and glorious, who laid so well the foundations of this 
marvelous intermountain commonwealth. You will find in the hearts 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 



57 



of the young folks of the Church an ambition so to live today that they 
may be worthy of their noble pioneer ancestors of yesterday. 

FAITH IN ALMIGHTY GtOD 

In this serious crisis when "we are at war," when the conditions 
we are facing are more serious than those we faced in France, .let us 
have faith in Almighty God as did Washington when he went upon 
his knees at Valley Forge. With that faith which makes nothing im- 
possible, let us sing : "Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just, 
And this be our motto : 'In God is our trust !' " And again, let us sing 
on, "Our fathers' (God, to Thee, Author of liberty, to Thee we sing; 
Long may our land be bright With freedom's holy light; Protect us by 
Thy might, Great God, our King." 

May that God, our King, in whom we trust as did our fathers, 
not forsake us, not forsake our Church, or our beloved country, I humbly 
pray. 

ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 

Of the 'First Council of Seventy 

I wish that I might bring to your minds on this day the divine truth 
that Christ our Lord is the most pure source of strength and comfort 
and peace that you can have. Many of you, my brethren and sisters, 
are passing through very sore trials. These days |are humbling isome 
of us to the very |dust, for disappointments have come, and the daily 
lives of piany of us |are filled with bitterness and sorrow. These are 
days of depression and ofttimes tragedy. It iseems that the world has 
gone far afield from its true end. We are (conscious of a discord, not 
in the Creator's plan : A discord brought about by the faltering, weak, 
blundering of all men. Living in the World O'f material things, and 
able by the gift of free-will to work out our destiny, we have by that 
free-will gone far astray. We were rnade in (the image of God ; we were 
made a little less than the iangels. < Yet strange is it not that the great 
gift which the Creator has bestowed upon jhis children should be the 
means whereby we should miss our destiny. 

We have become (children of fear. We are afraid to live, for we 
have grown sick of our failures and frailties. This America pf ours 
has gone mad with luxury, with indulgences, and bodily comfort, with an 
overwhelming external hurry and a tumult of distraction. We have 
become an unchecked, self-exultant people. The children of God have 
forgotten God. This is our trouble. The passion for rebellion, for 
destruction is mixed up with the eager longing to make Sthe world over. 
True, our churches are filled, but it is rather for social than religious 
purposes. I wonder how many pf us feel that the priest or minister of 
God is given the keys of heaven with the power to bind and to loose. 
I sometimes even wonder how many of uA — and ll am speaking of all 
mankind — really know the love of a true and living God. 

When God placed man in the Garden /of ! Eden, and man was shown 



58 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



his destiny, the Creator planted within his soul ( the power to look up 
and to find his |Maker through the power of faith. This gave man a 
splendor pf spirit, which is the greatest power of all; because only by 
the spirit can absolute truth be known. This gift of faith places man 
in an enviable position for the exercise of his (mental powers. Through- 
out all the ages, man lhas felt the still (small voice of the Almighty in his 
daily life. Our Jives must needs be deeply penetrated with ,a 'sense of 
the infinite God ; and this infinite, true, and living God can only be known 
by our approach to him in the humility of our powers. . We must again 
learn to .worship and (to glorify. 

The truth of all the (gifts of God to man can be known only as we 
have faith in God, fthe Father. Throughout the [history of Jthe race, 
heaven has been ibreaking in 'from time to time upon the affairs of men, 
and who knows but jwhat we are nearer the center of spiritual reality 
and life, than we (have dreamed of. 

Two thousand years ago, the greatest event in the history of man- 
kind happened. I refer to the birth of Christ, our Redeemer. I want 
to read you the (story as ,it was written by St. Luke, the evangelist. 
It is truly a piece of literary art. 

"And, it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from 
Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed. * * * 

"And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city. 

"And Joseph also went up from iGalilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into 
Judea, unto the city of David, "which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of 
the house and lineage of David:) 

"To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being (great with child. 

"And so it was, that while they were (there, the days were accomplished that 
she should be delivered. 

"And she brought forth her firstborn son, (and wrapped him in swaddling 
clothes, and laid him in a manger ; because there was no room for them in the inn. 

"And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping 
watch over their flock toy night. 

"And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord 
shone round about them : and they (were sore afraid. 

"And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good 
tidings pf great joy, which shall be to all people. • 

"For unto you is born this day, in the city of David, a Saviour, which is Christ, 
the Lord. 

"And this shall be a sign unto jyou ; Ye shall find the habe wrapped in 
swaddling clothes, lying ,in a manger. 

"And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host 
praising God, and saying, 

"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men." 

I read you these .words of the noble prophet of old, because they 
show how God's love gave to the world Him, who "is the way, the truth, 
and the life." It is Ithe message that our 'Father is guiding us, moulding 
us, (helping us, saving us. In these days of Isore trial, Christ our Lord 
is our Guide and our Savior. This is the (thing that jis giving us a glad 
confidence that all things are working together for good. So when 
the darkness comes, let us remember that the might brings out the stars 
as sorrows show us the truth ; and the insight that comes through pain 



ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 



59 



and disappointment may jbe the insight into Ithe value of what we are. 
So is aiot this word of the Lord "Fear not" a beautiful message? 

We think God has forgotten us, but he is still watching over us 
each and every one. We are like little children wandering through a 
forest. ' The [Constant drudgery of enervating work, the pressure of 
present sorrow and pain, and the weight of (responsibility too heavy to 
bear ; all these things distort our vision (at times, and behind (all these 
tragedies, we pee fear and failure. Fears that harass our courage along 
the pathway of life, until we become as children, lost in the dark. Who 
knows but what our trials are the circumstances that may make us find 
our way home and back to (God ? I want to tell you a story. I call it 
"Night and Shadows." 

"Once upon a time, a little girl wandered (through a dense forest on her way 
home. It was very dark. She was frightened and began to cry. The tears 
rolled down her face, as she timidly crept (along. Suddenly an elf appeared 
before her. 'Are you frightened' asked the elf. 'Yes, I'm scared,' answered the 
little girl, glad to show her fear, ;'Ain't you?' 

" 'Not a bit,' answered the elf. 

" 'Well then you don't see the ghosts and (goblins running around the trees, 
and the funny looking eyes up there in the (branches, and the bats and ugly things 
flying through the air, and (the scary noises, can't you hear them?' 

"And the elf said : 'I don't blame you for being scared, I'd be scared too 
if I saw all those ugly things. You ,see that when little girls have tears in their 
eyes, they can't see things as they really are.' 

" 'Just let [the tears dry in your eyes, and then we shall take a good look 
at these ghosts and goblins, and (ugly things. See those terrible eyes in the 
branches of the trees? Why they are just the (stars trying ,to light up your 
pathway so rthat you can find your way home ; and the big moon is trying to 
help them. And those big things aren't ghosts, they are just |the shadows of the 
trees. And iwhat you thought were ugly bats and ugly things are just the leaves 
falling on your pathway, making the path soft ifor your (tired feet. ; And the 
noises. Why, that's the wind blowing through the branches, and the trees are 
trying to sing a song to make you happy as you go along'." 

Our (trials will make us reach out into a truer and fuller life. We 
will think of him who when in the garden jof Gethsemane, ielt the 
solitude of human life; and then it was that he calmly said: "And 
yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me." 

One time in Israel's history, the prophet Isaiah exclaimed : 
"Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God. 

"Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her warfare is 
accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned : for she hath received of the JLord's 
hand double for all her .sins. i 

"The voice lof him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of 
the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway ! for our JGod. 

"Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall toe made 
low : and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain : 

"And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall sec it 
together: for the mouth of the Lord (hath spoken 'it." 

It is faith in God that gives us the light, and with faith we niay know 
the (truth as we approach our Maker. Faith lis the source of knowledge, 
of ,truth, and the Gospel of our Lord can only be known through faith. 
The ancient prophet Moroni wrote in his closing hours these words 
which should be written on the tablets of our hearts : 



60 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



"And when jye shall receive these things, I would exjhort you that ye would 
ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; 
and )if ye shall ,ask with .a sincere heart, with real intent, having (faith in Christ, 
he will manifest the -truth ,of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost. 

"'And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may (know the truth of all things." 

So in ithese days <of sorrow, of trial, of discouragement let us have 
faith ; .the faith of true sons of God. Then I believe all 'will be well. 
"We shall live by [faith." One time the noted .philosopher Santayana 
of Harvard University wrote : 

O world, thou choosest not the better (part. 

It is not wisdom to be only wise, 
And on the inward vision close the eyes; 

But it is wisdom to believe the heart. 
Columbus found a world and had no ichart. 

Save one that Faith deciphered in the skies ; 
To trust the soul's invincible surmise 

Was Jail his science and his only art. 
Our knowledge is a torch of smoky pine 

That lights the pathway but one |step ahead 
Across a void of mystery land dread. 

Bid then the tender light of faith to shine 
By which alone the mortal heart is led 

Unto the thinking of the thought divine. 

It is religion, the love of God and neighbor, which gives life a 
meaning ; knowledge cannot do it. 

"Let me, if you please, speak of my own experience," says a great world 
scholar, "as one who for thirty years has taken an earnest interest in these things. 
Pure knowledge is a [glorious thing, pnd woe to the man (who holds it .light or 
blunts his sense for it ! I But to the question, Whence, whither, and to ,what pur- 
pose ? It gives an answer today as [little as 'it did two ,or three (thousand years 
ago. It does, indeed, instruct us in (facts ; it detects inconsistencies ; it links 
phenomena ; it corrects the deceptions of sense and |idea. But where and how the 
curve of the world and the curve !of our own life begin — that curve )of which 
it shows us only a (section — and whither this curve (leads, knowledge does not 
tell MS. But if with ia steady will ,we affirm the forces and the standards which 
on the summits of our [inner life shine out as our highest jgood, nay, as our real 
self ; if we lare earnest and Courageous enough to accept 'them as the great 
reality and direct our lives by them ; and if iwe then look at the course of 
mankind's history, /follow its upward development, and search, in 'strenuous and 
patient service, for the communion of (minds in it, we ^hall not faint in weariness 
and despair, but become '.certain of God, of the God whom Jesus Christ called 
his Father, and who lis also lour Father." 

So be ye comforted ; God lives, and he is extending this loving hand 
to us. Will we respond with hearts full of faith? 
May the Lord our 'God bless us all. Amen. 

ELDER JAMES H. MOYLE 

President of the Eastern States Mission 

My brethren and sisters, if I were to call your attention to that 
which has more deeply impressed me than anything else pertinent in the 
world today, it would be the declaration of the scriptures that "To 
know Thee, the only true and living God is life eternal." That knowl- 



ELDER JAMES H. MOYLE 



61 



edge is the first great need of the world. And next, the declaration 
of our Savior that the first and great commandment is to "Love the 
Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all 
thy mind. * * * And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy 
neighbor as thyself." 

But what has very, very deeply impressed me is the succeeding 
declaration, that "On these two commandments hang all the law and 
the prophets." 

If I am right I can think of nothing that develops more the fulfil- 
ment of those declarations than being a missionary. The testimony of 
all who go upon missions with a sincere desire, as they do, to serve the 
Lord, is that they have never enjoyed themselves more than on their 
missions. In such service there is a spiritual development and a growth 
that is invaluable, especially to the young. 

I am pleased to say that in the Eastern States Mission our mission- 
aries enjoy, at the present time, exceptional health, and that their labors 
are resulting in unusual progress. With less than half the missionaries 
that we have had in times past our baptisms are almost equal in number 
to what they have heretofore been. If there are those who have 
resources that they could use, without too great sacrifice, to aid those 
who are on missions — some of whom are returning because of lack of 
finances — and to contribute to others who may go upon missions — if they 
fail to use those resources they are missing an opportunity, for the 
money will do double the service, apparently, that it has heretofore done. 

The world is in confusion. One preacher says that it is standing 
on its head. Great philosophers are saying that the civilization of this 
age is upon the precipice of destruction and that unless great changes 
take place in our social and industrial organizations it will go over the 
precipice and into destruction, and we will again have the Dark Ages. 
President Butler of Columbia University has made this declaration 
recently. Mr. H. G. Wells, the historian, philosopher and scientist, has 
made the same declaration, and so also have others. 

This is a mechanical age, in which the gifts of the creative power 
of God, as has been declared by another great scientist, so far exceed 
the wisdsom and the knowledge and the power of man to utilize them 
that it can hardly be determined whether they are an advantage or a 
disadvantage. 

It is my belief that without greater love of God and of fellow -men 
our civilization is threatened. We are our brother's keeper. That great 
law which has governed society so long, the survival of the fittest, does 
not fit in with the age in which we live. The general level of intelligence 
is such among mankind that poverty and distress in the midst of 
abundance and superabundance cannot continue to exist as they do. 
Hundreds of thousands, I believe millions, are today, in this land of 
plenty and abundance, suffering from undernourishment. Honest work- 
ers, men who are sincere in their desire to provide for themselves and 
those dependent upon them, are unable to obtain the necessities of life 
when they abound so greatly, when the plea is now being made that we 



62 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



should not produce so much. What is the result of this? It is com- 
monly said in New York City and in the great industrial centers of 
the East, that men who have been receiving salaries of five, ten, fifteen 
and twenty thousand dollars, are now beggars, and why ? It is because 
there has been a failure to know God and to obey his laws and to love 
their neighbors. They have spent that which they have received. 

Whatever may be the hope of return of prosperity, of improvement 
in the business condition of the world, there is today in the great in- 
dustrial centers of the East an increasing number of those who are de- 
pendent upon charity because their resources are being exhausted. 

What great organization in the world is doing something to in- 
tensify and increase the love of God, the knowledge of God, the real 
belief in an actual God and Father and Creator, and the love of brother? 
I have said unhesitatingly, wherever I have gone, that there are no 
people who are developing those qualities like the Latter-day Saints. 
That is exhibited in the declarations that we have heard from this stand 
during this conference, of the contributions that have been made to 
charity through the fast fund donation. There is nothing more beautiful 
in society, in any of the organizations of the world, to relieve distress, 
than is found in that thought. 

The tithing, the missionary system, the work in our temples — all 
are developing a love of fellow-men, a love of God and a nearness to 
him such, in my opinion, as can be found among no other people. 
Imperfect as we may be, the groundwork, the foundation is laid, upon 
which we merely need to build, to erect a social structure that will relieve 
poverty, that will increase the happiness of man, and that will bring us 
nearer to that system which the Savior attempted to establish and did 
establish when he was upon the earth, where there were no rich and 
no poor; and that which he again revealed in this age to the Prophet 
Joseph Smith in what we call the United Order. 

I can well remember the contest that was going on during my boy- 
hood days to establish the eight-hour labor day system. Men then 
worked seventy hours a week, no Saturday afternoons off. That fight 
has been won. And to be brief, today we have in our own great 
country leaders of industry that are coming to accept not only the 
eight-hour day, with Saturday afternoon off, but a five-day week with 
Saturday off. 

As I say, with the mechanical devices that are making it possible 
to satisfy the demands of mankind with less labor, we are approaching 
the time when there will be more of a (Utopian system in the world 
than it has ever seen before. Impracticable as may be, in the minds of 
most people, the thought of the establishment of what we have called the 
"United Order," and little as I feel myself prepared for it — certainly 
no more than others — yet I believe we are coming to it. We are being 
driven to it. These institutions that have been established — the fast day 
contribution, the tithing, the marvelous work of our Relief Society 
women — are only leading up to it and preparing us for it. 

I rejoice when I am able to say in the world that a hundred per 



ELDER JAMES H. MOYLE 



63 



cent of that which is contributed to charity by our people goes to 
charity. I know of no other organization that can make that claim. It 
is true there is a vast amount of charitable work done gratuitously, but 
there is no permanent institution established that I know anything 
about in which there is such a system. 

May the Lord bless this great work in which we are engaged, and 
fit and prepare us for the great events which I believe are pending in 
the world, and which are in progress — revolutionary changes, changes 
all over the world. I have no sympathy with the anti-Christian social- 
ism of Russia, or of Europe, but the time is coming when the Latter- 
day Saints will have impressed upon them more and more, and we will 
see more clearly, the beauties of the Gospel of Jesus Christ as it has 
been revealed in these the last days, and will sense the responsibility that 
is upon us. May we realize it. 

I want to appeal again to those who have the means to enable them 
to assist missionaries who are leaving their fields of labor because of 
their parents' inability to keep them there, that you contribute to the limit, 
for it is a marvelous work. I have met since I have been here a number 
of our young people who have returned from their missions. They 
repeat to me again and again the joy that they have in the work they 
did, and the blessings that they were enjoying while they were on their 
missions. They wish that they could go back, and would do so if it were 
possible. 

May this work grow and prosper, especially the missionary work 
in which I am especially interested. It provides joy and happiness and 
a satisfaction that I have never experienced in any other work. It 
enables me to forget self, more than anything else I know of. It 
cultivates the love of God. It brings us nearer to God. It gives us a 
clearer comprehension and a deeper conviction of his reality and exist- 
ence. Those of you who are failing to assist your children on missions 
and to assist others who are willing to contribute their time are failing 
in the performance of your duty. 

May God help us, I pray, in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

The hymn. "Guide us, O thou Great Jehovah," was sung by the 
congregation. 

Elder Harvey Sessions, Patriarch, Cache Stake, offered the closing 
prayer. 

The Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock. 



AFTERNOON MEETING 



The fourth session of the Conference commenced promptly at 
2 o'clock Saturday afternoon, October 8. 

The congregation sang the hymn, "Our mountain home so dear." 

Patriarch Charles R. Jones, of the Summit Stake, offered the 
opening prayer. 

The hymn, "O say, what is truth?" was sung by the congregation. 

ELDER DAVID O. McKAY 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

My brethren and sisters, I have greatly enjoyed each session of this 
conference. The inspirational addresses given have buoyed us up and 
will aid us in determining upon definite lines of action during the next 
six months, in which the Church can be most benefited by united effort. 
To one of these fields of needed activity, I wish to direct your attention 
for a few minutes. 

OUR GREATEST OBLIGATION 

An eminent statesman in the United States once wrote: 

"If we work upon marble it will perish ; if upon brass, time will efface it. 
If we rear temples they will crumble into dust. But if we work upon immortal 
minds, imbue them with principles with a just fear of God and love of fellow 
men, we engrave upon those tablets that which time cannot efface and which will 
endure through all eternity." 

That thought, impressively expressed, gives an idea of the theme 
I should like to stress this afternoon. We are deeply perturbed, in 
these clays, about great social questions. The best minds of the nation 
are now struggling with problems associated with one of the greatest 
financial crises that have ever swept this nation and the world. Im- 
portant as this is, and other social and political questions, I believe that 
the profoundest problem which this country faces, indeed the greatest 
obligation upon th'e government today, national, state and local, is to 
determine how best to guide, protect, and educate properly, childhood 
and youth. This may seem commonplace to many of you, so common- 
place that you will wonder why I take up the time of so important an 
assembly to speak of it. 

ATTITUDE OF THE NATION'S PRESIDENT 

Tie that as it may, I believe all agencies interested in child welfare 
could cooperate in this great work to the great good of our state and 
nation. There are phases of this problem which affect the happiness and 
peace of mind of every father and mother in the land. The question 



ELDER DAVID O. McKAY 



65 



of child health and guidance goes to the very root of our national life. 
No less an authority than the President of the United States, has aptly 
said : 

"These questions are a complicated problem, requiring much learning and 
much action, and we need have great concern over this matter. Let no one believe 
that these are questions which should not stir a nation, that they are below the 
dignity of statesmen or governments. ' If we could have but one generation of 
properly born, trained, educated and healthy children, a thousand other problems 
of government would vanish. We would assure ourselves of healthier minds in 
more vigorous bodies, to direct the energies of our nation to yet greater heights 
of achievement." 

IN THE REALM OF DELINQUENCY 

In calling your attention to this important problem I have not in 
mind especially the tens of thousands of lads in quorum activity nor the 
one hundred thousand boys and girls enrolled in Primary in the Church 
nor the hundred thousand more young people engaged in Mutual 
Improvement work, or the two hundred and sixty thousand enrolled in 
Sunday School. Rather I have in mind the tens of thousands who are 
not enrolled in these quorums and associations, and also the boys and 
girls who are not affiliated even with church membership. I shall 
eliminate many of those, and ask you to consider this afternoon only 
that group who have crossed the border-line and entered the realm of 
delinquency — I shall not say criminality. 

Neither have I in mind merely the church as an agency to guide 
these children and youth, but all agencies in the state which are engaged 
either directly or indirectly in winning back this group of boys and girls 
who are causing us great concern. In the realm of indifference and 
delinquency are the causes of mothers' heartbreaks, of fathers' chagrin, 
hunfiliation and sorrow. Comparatively speaking, there are not many 
in that realm, but I am wondering if all agencies are cooperating 
sufficiently to reduce to a minimum the number of boys who have crossed 
the border-line. i 

There were 5,705 cases of delinquency before the Juvenile Court 
during the year 1929-1930, and about as many cases of dependency and 
neglect. For the year beginning July 1st, 1931, and ending June 30th, 
1932, there have come before that court in the Third Judicial District 
a total of 843 cases — 627 boys, 216 girls, between the ages of ten and 
eighteen years. 

COOPERATIVE EFFORT NEEDED 

The Utah Council on Child Health and Protection is at the present 
time carrying forward a plan to establish an organization in each county 
in this state for the purpose of aiding childhood and youth. Nearly half 
the counties have that organization now. These county officers may 
have access to the reports of the Utah White House Conference dealing 
with the relation of the churches, Boy Scouts, Four H Clubs, and other 
agencies concerned in the welfare of childhood and youth. 



66 



GENERA L CONFERENCE 



I hope that all men and women associated with these groups, will 
join us in the appeal for more cooperative effort in behalf of handling 
the problem of youth. In the report referred to I find this : 

"For every case of delinquency there is somewhere a contributing factor to 
such delinquency. The delinquent acts are but surface symptoms of deeper 
stresses and difficulties reaching far into the social life of the community, and 
back into the earlier home and school life of the child. The community owes a 
debt of protection to children that it does not owe to adults. Guardians of the 
child have a duty to set such examples of honesty, sincerity and courage as will 
challenge the child's emulation, and in these patterns of character and good 
citizenship lies the cure of juvenile delinquency, rather than in the powers of 
the court." 

It is estimated that about one-twelfth of a child's time is spent in 
school, approximately one-third, or four-twelfths, spent in sleep. Vary- 
ing amounts above the four-twelfths are spent daily in the home. Let 
us say roughly that about sixty per cent of the child's time, during 
the eighteen years that we are considering now, is spent in the home, 
in sleep, and in school. That leaves forty per cent of a child's life to be 
spent outside of these influences. I ask you guardians of the home 
what you are doing to direct the efforts of childhood during that forty 
per cent of his life in which he is left alone to be really himself. 

THE RESPONSIBILITY OF PARENTS 

The agencies that are affecting the child you well know. First 
comes the home. Upon fathers and mothers the Lord placed one of 
the greatest responsibilities that can come to human beings. Hear again 
what he says : 

"Inasmuch as parents have children in Zion, or in any of her stakes which 
are organized, that teach them not to understand the doctrine of repentance, 
faith in Christ the Son of the Living God, and of baptism and the gift of the 
Holy Ghost by the laying on of the hands, when they are eight years old, the 
sin be upon the heads of the parents." 

I believe that parents generally are doing this, yet I am convinced 
that there is still much opportunity for improvement in this regard. I 
am not thinking of the set hours in which you sit down to teach these 
doctrines to your children, but of the example fathers and mothers give 
to their children as regards to the faith that is dear to your hearts. 
Your example will teach these principles, more effectively than what 
you say. Out of our homes come the future leaders of the government. 
If our homes were all they should be, the nation would be safe. 

But too many homes are broken. Statistics tell us that "The so-called 
broken home appears in about one-third of all the delinquency cases 
which come before the juvenile courts throughout the country." How- 
ever, in this state (Utah) out of the 5,705 cases of delinquency before 
the juvenile courts, 4,043 children were residing with both parents in 
their own homes. Such a report should challenge our best thought. 

If in this state the majority of delinquents come from homes that 
are unbroken, I appeal to parents to think more seriously of the revelation 



ELDER DAV ID 0. McKAY • 67 



found in the sixty-eighth section of the Doctrine and Covenants, part 
of which I have just read to you. 

THE SCHOOL A RESPONSIBLE FACTOR 

Next to the home the school is the responsible factor in child train- 
ing. We have in the state forty school districts, with a school population 
of approximately 150,000. In 1929 fourteen districts had persons 
specially appointed to deal with attendance and school coordination 
problems. Of these fourteen only seven districts had the services of 
one or more persons on full time, and were serving about sixty-five 
per cent of the school children of the state. Thirty-five percent, in round 
numbers, are without such service. 

THE INFLUENCE OF THE CHURCH 

Next in importance — in some respects I place it chief in importance 
— is the influence of the church. Of four thousand boys under the age 
of twenty-one who appeared before Judge Lewis L. Faucett of the 
State Supreme Court of New York, only three had belonged to a 
Sunday School. I saw in the public press of this city the other day 
the report that of 6,642 cases tried directly or indirectly over a period 
of several years by Judge Nielsen of the Juvenile Court only two per 
cent or 133, had attended Sunday School. 

We might give at length ample proof of religious training as a 
safeguard in the community and as a preventative of delinquency. 

There are three fundamental steps to take if we would win back 
these boys and girls. The first is to become acquainted with them, to 
know them. I was delighted yesterday by the reports given before the 
Aaronic Priesthood conference, which gave the number of young boys 
who had been brought into activity, who two years ago were inactive. 

You all know that in 1931 the Church put forth an effort, under 
the auspices of the Sunday School, to account for every boy and girl 
who should be enrolled. In one year's effort 18,000 who previously had 
not been enrolled were brought into the fold. 

REACHING THE WAYWARD 

Today I heard a report from a man who is interested in the 4-H 
clubs, to the effect that in one county, in two districts, every girl between 
the ages of twelve and twenty is enrolled in one or more organizations 
interested in girls' welfare. I cite these examples merely to show that 
the boys and girls who step over the border-line may be successfully 
reached. They are not all bad boys and girls. They are erring young 
people who need our help. 

That brings me to the second step, the power of personality. You 
are not going to bring back erring youth unless you first let them know 
that you are interested in them. Let them feel your heart touch. Only 
the warm heart can kindle warmth in another. Wayward boys and 
girls are sometimes suspicious of people around them. Others get the 



68 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



idea that they are not wanted. The kind hand or the loving arm, 
removes suspicion and awakens confidence. Your own experience bears 
ample evidence of the value of personal companionship. 

The third essential is activity. We shall never accomplish the great 
object that is before us, in relation to childhood, until we realize that 
every boy and girl must have something to do. Generally speaking 
every child should be occupied in either sleeping, eating, working, study- 
ing or playing. Supervised play during the forty per cent of his active 
life outside home and school is a very important factor. 

COOPERATION NEEDED 

Now, let me just say a word further about the various groups that 
are interested in this work. I quote again from the Utah White House 
Conference report : 

« 

"The work of both the Boy and the Girl Scout is well known. The program 
is definite, constructive, and very much worth while. Closer cooperation between 
Scouts and schools is urged. 

"Service clubs have done and are doing some work looking to the betterment 
of boys and girls, but not in the amount and quality which might be done. 

"The forest service is ready to do its part in the movement under consider- 
ation. It has provided mountain recreation centers, and is anxious to cooperate 
with the schools in teaching boys and girls how to use the forest areas to a 
greater degree. 

"A splendid attitude is manifested by the newspapers of the state. They 
are ready and anxious to cooperate with the schools and any other agency in 
promoting the welfare of our children. They have done much in this respect 
by fostering wholesome activities, providing suitable reading matter, and encour- 
aging, through publications, the commendable work of others. 

"Evidently the most pressing need which has manifested itself to your 
sub-committee has to do with the bringing about of better cooperation between 
the public and private schools of the state and the various organizations men- 
tioned." 

The need of coordinating these and other agencies in their efforts 
to better childhood is apparent to every thinking person. The situation 
calls for a State Welfare Department, the special duty of which will be 
to employ the most modern methods of dealing with the problems of 
training youth and particularly to center attention upon the preventions 
of delinquency and other social ills. 

As a summary of the message I have tried to convey to you, I 
quote the following lines : 

"He stood at the crossroads all alone, 

The sunrise in his face ; 
He had no thought for the world unknown, 

He was set for a manly race. 
But the road stretched east and the road stretched west, 

And the boy knew not which road was best. 
So he strolled on the road that led him down, 

And he lost the race and the victor's crown, 
He was caught at last in an angry snare, 

Because no one stood at the crossroads there 
To show him the better road. 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY 



b9 



"Another day at the self-same place, 

A boy with high hopes stood; 
He, too, was set for a manly race, 

He, too, was seeking the things that were good. 
But one was there who the roads did know, 

And that one showed him which way to go; 
So he turned from the road that would lead him down, 

And he won the race and the victor's crown, 
He walks today the highway fair, 

Because one stood at the crossroads there, 
To show him the better road." 

God inspire us all to make the Church of God effective in saving the 
youth of the land, in instilling in their hearts faith in God, in his Son, 
and in the restoration of the Gospel, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

ELDER ALONZO A. HINCKLEY 

President of the 'California Mission 

This is a very great privilege and a very grave responsibility. I 
will be happy if the Lord shall inspire me with his Holy Spirit and 
enable me to speak that which he would have me say. I believe in the 
spirit of inspiration. In this mature period of my life I have long since 
learned, in this Church, that if I am left alone I am weak indeed ; but 
not if inspired and in the cause of truth. There is no power that can 
overcome the man who is inspired of the Lord and who speaks in 
defense of righteousness. 

I come with a cheering report from the California Mission. No 
man could live in California a winter and a summer and not feel led 
to speak well of that great country, as well as of her people. The Cali- 
fornia Mission includes most of Galifornia, most of Arizona, and most 
of Nevada, and represents millions of choice people. Our place in 
that mission seems to be firmly taken. Our numbers there increase 
steadily. Our stability seems to be assured. The happiness of the 
people is continuous. I find a satisfaction among them that is very 
gratifying. Thousands, many thousands. I think possibly forty thousand 
people, members of the Church, are in that locality ; perhaps more than 
that; many of them in organized stakes. The mission proper, outside 
the boundaries of these stakes, includes about twelve thousand people, 
among them some of the choicest in the world. 

The presidents of those sixty-three branches, with their counselors 
and the heads of the auxiliary organizations, include men and women 
who know the truth and live it, who love the Lord and love his children, 
and are respected by all men. 

from the point of good works and improvement, measured upon 
every line that we measure in this Church of Jesus Christ, things are 
favorable. The righteousness of the people is increasing. They may 
be worried; many of them, being wage-earners, are left on reduced 
wages and shortened hours that they are permitted to labor, and many 



70 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



of them only have occasional opportunities to labor to earn their living.. 
Financially I should say that perhaps they were never worse off. Spir- 
itually I should say that I think they were never more prosperous. 
From point of health I bring you good report. 

Now, relative to the missionary work, I could easily call for help, 
and know that it would be a hard matter to receive it. I think I have 
made a report that the missionary force there has dropped from the 
high point at one time when men and women commissioned of the Lord 
went from place to place over that great area, lifting their warning 
voices, when we had as high as two hundred and twenty-one. Today 
it will sound serious to you when I shall make the report that there are 
but twenty-five full-time Elders and eleven sisters in that field. 

If we had to look after the work of all of that great group of 
people and try to do the work that was formerly done by missionaries 
that were sent out from Zion, you will understand readily that we 
would be in a very helpless condition. But we have fortunately not 
been left to suffer as these figures would indicate. We have called for 
help from among the many down there who know the truth as you and I 
know the truth, and who live it as faithfully as we have ever dared to 
live it or ever could live it; who hold the same priesthood, have the 
same love of God in their hearts, the same love of his children, and a 
courage that is built up by being out in a world that offers resistance — 
I say among that group, when we called for help, the response was 
wonderful. One hundred and six Elders and thirty sisters have been 
appointed, and the service they are rendering is marvelous in its result. 
They stand upon the streets as fearlessly, as boldly, as your sons and 
your daughters have done in days gone by, and testify of the restored 
Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. In their homes, as they go to and 
come from their work, at the bench, or wherever they labor, they 
manifest righteousness before all men. Their lives are eloquent sermons. 
Wjhen they appear at the door of a house and introduce themselves as 
commissioned servants of the Lord Jesus Christ, it may be at the 
home of a neighbor who works side by side with them ; and whenever 
that is the case the door opens, the Elder enters, he offers his message, 
invites the members of that household unto the Lord Jesus Christ, and 
testifies to them of this great work. So the efficiency of that great 
mission and the results of the labors of the missionaries in that mission 
indicate that the work has not slackened but that it moves on. 

Never have I had greater joy in all my life, in all the Church work 
that I have ever done. It has seemed to me that the greatest joy comes 
in the proclamation of the Gospel. That early experience of my younger 
manhood days, in far-off Holland, three years of service, has always 
been one of the bright spots of my life. That same love and joy was 
renewed a few years hence when I was permitted to labor under the 
kindly direction of President Callis in the Southern States Mission. 
And now, out in the California Mission, that comes back with the same 
gratifying, satisfying, blessed results. 

I bear testimony to you of these young men with whom I am 



ELDER ALONZO A. HINCKLEY 



71 



permitted to labor, clean in attire, clean in body, honest in heart, qualified 
in intelligence and in learning and in understanding of the truths of the 
Gospel. With these fundamental requisites, lighted up by the inspiration 
of the Almighty, they go forth with hearts aglow, and their testimony 
is burning. To be associated with them, to feel the spirit of their 
young manhood, and the strength of their faith, stirs my soul to the 
very depths. The Saints love them, I love them, and I tell you we are 
one. The Lord loves them and he magnifies them. Their influence 
is holy wherever they go. They love these truths. They fear no man. 
They have a courage that never surrenders. They, I tell you, are the 
very salt of the earth. 

It is very impressive to see these young men, in the strength of 
their manhood, and these young women, when the day comes that you 
can tender unto them an honorable release — to see them as they stand 
and know that this relationship is being broken in part, and hardly 
know what they shall meet when they reach home — and they break 
down and say : "May the Lord grant that I may retain forever this 
spirit that leads me not only to love God my Father, but to love his 
children and seek their salvation and their welfare." It brings them 
home qualified to carry responsibility. My prayer is that they shall be 
used, that in this high point of qualification to serve they shall never 
rest, but that they shall go on with this service forever and forever. 

I leave my testimony with you of the joy that I have in declaring 
that which I do know. I tell you that there is no joy that equals the 
joy of having that which you know the world needs, and offering it 
unto them as the power that will lead them out of their troubles, settle 
all the doubts in their hearts, and lead them on to salvation. This is 
the glorious work that we are proclaiming, and it is for the world, for 
the salvation of the world, and God leads it to victory. That is my 
testimony, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

Sister Bessie Morley sang a sacred solo, "To every heart." 

ELDER HUGH B. BROWN 

President of the Granite Stake 

In harmony with the song which has just been so impressively sung, 
may I refer to the words of the poet Cooper, taken from that sacred 
hymn, "God Moves in a Mysterious Way:" 

Judge not the Lord by feeble sense, 

But trust him for his grace. 
Behind a frowning providence 

He hides a smiling face. 

His purposes will ripen fast, 

Unfolding every hour : 
The bud may have a bitter taste, 

But sweet will be the flower. 



72 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Blind unbelief is sure to err, 

And scan his work in vain. 
God is his own interpreter, 

And he shall make it plain. 

I should like to read two verses from the book of Joel : 

"Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy mountain: 
let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the day of the Lord cometh, for 
it is nigh at hand ; 

"A day of darkness and of gloominess, a day of clouds and of thick darkness, 
as the morning spread upon the mountains : a great people and a strong ; there 
hath not been ever the like, peither shall be any more after it, even to the years 
of many generations." 

For four years and more 1914 to 1918 — the greatest of world wars 
raged on the European and Asiatic frontiers, to which the continents 
of America and Africa contributed their full share. Twenty million 
of the physically finest men of the nations were among the casualties. 
Then came so-called peace. But during the fourteen years that have 
ensued we have had some twenty wars and the distracted, nerve-racked, 
panic-stricken world has witnessed the most disturbing period of alleged 
national and international harmony ever known. 

Perhaps never in history have the leaders of nations been more 
earnest in their desires for lasting peace, but never before have men 
been so much concerned about the future. They see in coming events 
dangers to our civilization. May I refer briefly to what some of them 
have said? The Prince of Wales, speaking to the young people of the 
British Empire, this year, at Albert Hall, in London, said : 

"We have before us today a world sick with fearful doubts, weary with 
repeated disappointments, a world of troubled nations, whose vital need is 
courageous faith. It is an era of potential plenty, when confidence should be 
supreme, yet we see in almost every land wide-spread distress and perplexity." 

In their call to prayer at the opening of the year, the Moderators 
of the Churches of Scotland wrote to their people : 

"The complicated problems and haunting uncertainties which loom ahead 
in 1932 cause stout hearts to quake and quail." 

Dr. Widtsoe, writing from Europe in April of this year, said : 

"The distress that covers these European lands has never been more serious 
in written history. There will have to be some tremendous readjustments before 
peace and prosperity will rule these lands again." 

Frank H. Simonds, the noted international writer : 

"No one in Europe, holding responsible office, is blind to the fact that the 
whole continent is sinking into an almost indescribable state of economic and 
financial prostration." 

W. T. Ellis : 

"Mankind is befuddled and bewildered, and even cloudy today, because it 
has lost the landmarks of faith, and the sense of a Supreme Being and 



ELDER * flUGH B. BROWN 73 

His eternal law. We have got Ito get down to the everlasting verities of life. 
That means that the world must hear with new distinctness and understanding, 
'thus saith the Lord*," 

I refer to these expressed opinions of well informed men not to 
emphasize the seriousness of the situation but that the challenge of it 
might be recognized. Surely the duty of the church today is first to call 
attention to existing conditions; and secondly, if possible, point the 
way out. 

The Christian Advocate, a Methodist paper, makes this statement : 

"The Church of Jesus Christ is under a heavy responsibility, in these times, 
to lead the masses out of economic bondage in which they suffer. That is its 
commission, as truly as it was the high calling of Moses to free the serfs of 
Egypt from their industrial slavery. The economic motive, which is the motive 
of finding a chance to live, is the weightiest consideration in the midst of the 
millions. Already we clearly see the set of the tide. He is blind who does not 
see it. He is worse than blind who will not." 

World leaders are directing their attention to the vital need of 
religion. One says : 

"The world in its misery and impotence awaits that redemption and relief 
which religion only can give." 

Professor Ladd of Yale says : 

"The call of the world of men today, which is most insistent and intense, 
if not most loud and clamorous, is for a rehabilitation of religious faith." 

One of our scientists detects the dawn of what he calls "scientific 
spirituality" and he says : 

"Happily there is dawning upon our age a scientific spirituality, a new type 
of mind, that studies the truths of faith with the care, caution and candor of 
science, keeping the warmth and glow and power of faith." 

Another recognizes the value of religion in these words : 

"While I rejoice in the .advance of science, I deplore the desuetude of regular 
religious services, with their encouragement of worship and prayer, for the good 
reason that personal experience and the study of history convince me that this 
absence of the religious habit leads to an ugly chaos in private and public morals 
and to ja subtle lowering of the sense of beauty." 

And further we read : 

"What great deliverance could come to the unnumbered thousands suffering 
from hidden complexes, exaggerated inferiority, inward conflicts, fear, phobias 
and anxieties, all leading to ineffectiveness and unhappiness, if religion were to 
harness its incomparable dynamic to the fine tools of personal and analytical 
psychology." 

We were reminded yesterday by President Hinckley of some of the 
characteristics of our fathers. How they met and overcame their 
difficulties and obstacles. We were told they were men of courage 
and resourcefulness, men whose religion was a dominant factor in 
every decision; men who understood something of the dynamic of 



74 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



religion as mentioned by our modern writers. Our fathers recognized 
the value of spiritual leadership and the course of their intensely prac- 
tical lives was determined by it. They had faith in. God and with that 
faith courageously met their problems and hopefully faced the future. 

This challenge of our background issues directly to the young men 
and women of the Church in this crisis. It will not be long until this 
work will pass to the shoulders of your sons and daughters. It will 
not be long until these presiding officers, who have borne the brunt of 
the battle for so many years, will be released and the work will devolve 
upon the young men and women of the Church. How well are they pre- 
pared ? 

I corroborate and should like to emphasize the splendid tribute 
which /President Harris paid to the young people of the Church. My 
contacts with them inspire me with the thought that this is truly the 
work of God, and that he is raising up an army of young men and young 
women to carry it forward. /We recently called upon them in one of 
the stakes to respond to the great duty of helping their less fortunate 
brothers and sisters. Their faith in the Church was manifested by their 
hearty response and willing sacrifice causing us to feel that the older 
members need not fear for its future. These young people, with the 
help of God, will carry on. They have not forgotten the promises of 
the Lord, made through the same prophet Joel, from whom we read 
this afternoon. Later in the same chapter he says : 

"And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am the Lord 
your God, and none else : and my people shall never be ashamed. And it shall 
come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your 
sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your 
young men shall see visions." 

For years we have been teaching our theology, and successfully 
teaching it to the world. We must now make practical application of 
our religion ; must again refer to and apply in our daily lives the words 
of the Master as recorded in holy writ. May I read some of them : 

"Love one another." 

"By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples." 

"By love, serve one another, for all the law is fulfilled in one word, even 
in this, thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself." 

"When ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service 
of your God." 

"All things whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, do ye even 
so to them." 

"Bear one another's burden, and so fulfil the law of Christ." 
"Above all things, clothe yourselves with the bonds of charity as with a 
mantle." 

"Remember the poor, and consecrate of thy properties for their support, 
that which thou hast to impart unto them, with a covenant and a deed which cannot 
be broken." 

"Inasmuch as ye impart of your substance unto the poor, ye will do it 
unto me." 

"Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he also shall cry himself, 
but shall not be heard." 

It seems to me that the application of the principles of the Gospel 



ELDER HUGH B. BROWN 75 

of Jesus Christ is the most important task before us today. As I listened 
to Elder McKay this afternoon, telling us of the millions of young 
people outside the churches whose hearts are not being touched by 
religious instruction, I thought, this Church must furnish leadership 
for the world, must show the way out of this serious economic situation 
by .calling attention to the message of Jesus and by applying the prin- 
ciples taught by him. 

The young people of the Church have asked, What is the Church 
doing to lead the way out? And the answer has been given in this 
conference that from the time of its organization doctrines have been 
taught, advice and admonition have been given, which, if followed, 
would most definitely meet the need of the hour. The leadership is here 
if we have the courage and faith to follow it. I am sure the young 
people of the Church have such faith. I feel that they will respond 
to the call that is now made of them. I believe that they will do, as 
the Apostle Paul advised when he said : 

"Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. 

"Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against 
the wiles of the devil. 

"For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against 
powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual 
wickedness in Jiigh places. 

"Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be 
able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. 

"Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the 
breastplate of righteousness. 

"And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace; 

"Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench 
all the fiery darts of the wicked. 

"And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the 
word of God : 

"Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching 
thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints." 

I testify to the truth of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. I testify that 
I know this is his work. I know he is at the helm. Though there may 
be troublous times ahead of us, we have the 'absolute assurance of 
victory. There may be and will be "days of darkness and gloominess" 
as predicted in the first scripture read, but we know that he whom we 
serve will see us through. Let us not be content to call attention to the 
predictions made concerning the calamities which are to befall the 
nations, but rather emphasize the glorious promises of final victory 
and peace. 

God grant that we may put on the armour of faith, that through 
living the Gospel of Jesus Christ we may provide leadership for the 
world, for I believe it will yet be demanded of us. I pray for his Spirit 
and blessing upon us, that we may not be afraid, that we may not talk 
gloom or despondency or discouragement, but we may emulate the 
lives of our fathers, and with courage and resourcefulness and absolute 
faith in God go forward to meet the battles and problems of this age. 
I promise you, my brethren and sisters, that with that faith we will 
conquer. May it be so, I pray, through Jesus Christ. Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

We have heard many strong testimonies, many fervent admonitions, 
much good advice, quotations of numerous scriptures, every one to 
the point, in this conference. You will agree with me in the thought that 
it is good for us to be here and to have been here in the earlier sessions. 
W,hen this conference shall end we are not going away disappointed, 
but enriched and encouraged, I trust, in the duties that lie immediately 
before us. 

RELIGION A SUPPORT 

Of late I have found the thought welling up in my mind, even 
more forcefully and persistently than usual : Of what use to me is my 
religion under these times of special stress and test ? I take it that even 
if you had not known before you came here that we are living under 
times of pressure and strain you would know it by this time, for several 
speakers have emphasized the fact. If you had not realized that 
there is something called the depression abroad in the world, you must 
have found it out by this time, for that also has been mentioned by 
speaker after speaker. 

The word "depression" has become decidedly trite, but I do not 
know any other word in the English language that exactly expresses 
the condition we wish to describe. Now, we must recognize that as an 
existing condition. It is no mere theory, but a solemn fact. It is not 
merely a local condition, it is not only nation-wide, but world-wide. 

PRESENT CONDITION FORETOLD 

It may be small comfort to remind you that this thing was definitely 
foretold. It may perhaps not soften the fact of your financial difficulties 
to tell you that you have heard of these hard times from the mouths of 
those whom you sustain as your leaders, utterances made from this 
stand, and from the pulpits in your several stakes and wards for lo, these 
many years past. Some of you will know that I, with my brethren, have 
been very plain in citing to you scriptures, perhaps apologizing in a 
way for appearing a little pessimistic, yet begging you to understand 
the predictions as being the nature of optimistic warnings in the way of 
caution and counsel. 

True, this reminder may not be of any more comfort to you than 
that to a boy who is writhing in the after effects of eating green apples 
to be told that he was warned against green apples. 

FAILURE TO UNDERSTAND 

Remember that the Lord said to his disciples in the day of his 
personal ministry : I tell you these things beforehand, that when they 
come to pass you may see and understand. 

He knew very well that not many of them would open their ears 



ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE 



77 



and their hearts and understand at the time what he said. He told 
them of the troubles that were about to befall Jerusalem. He told them 
of the persecutions that were coming upon them, his chosen ones. He 
told them of the crucifixion that was awaiting himself, and they could 
not or would not understand but tried to explain away his words as 
passing remarks incident to the times. Do you not remember how he 
tried to make them understand that he was speaking in earnest, and 
that he wanted them to take his words literally? 

On that solemn march of his on the way to Jerusalem and the 
tomb, traversing the roads slowly, and halting wherever he found people 
willing to listen to him, he stopped and beckoned his followers to come 
up, and said to them : Let this thing sink down deep into your ears 
and hearts — I, the Son of Man, am on my way to Jerusalem to be handed 
over to wicked men, I am to be crucified and on the third day shall 
rise again. 

Then he passed on, and they talked among themselves wondering — 
What in the world does he mean by rising again ? Even after he had 
risen from the sepulcher there were many who doubted. When the 
women came from the tomb with the gladsome news some of the disciples 
treated the story as but an idle tale based on emotional imagination. 

Well, that may be a trait of human nature developed through the 
centuries, but I trust we can rise above it, and open our eyes and our 
hearts and come to an understanding of what the Lord has told us, of 
what he is telling us, for he speaks today in terms that are literal 
and in the language that we best can understand. 

HUMAN WISDOM MAY BE AT FAULT 

Oh, there are so many tongues spoken among men ; the world is 
a babel ; but of the tongues used by the Lord in his communication 
with men he selects for each occasion the language that they ought to 
understand. He spoke through the voice of prophecy, year after year, 
decade after decade, century after century, telling of the wars that 
would surely come in the last days, warning the people against the 
conditions that would make those wars certain. But would men hear? 
On the very eve of the outbreak of the World War there stood in 
this very pulpit one of the world's greatest thinkers, who declared 
conditions to be such that there never could be another great war between 
and among the major powers of the world ; that the financial interests 
of the world were such as to forbid. Then having demonstrated, by 
the citation of statistics and figures many, that there could not be such 
a war, he proceeded to demonstrate that if war did break out in spite 
of all, it could not last more than six weeks; for there was not enough 
wealth in the world to keep a war going with present-day weapons and 
under conditions of modern fighting, more than a few weeks. 

I heard him speak, and I had occasion afterward to say to him : 
"Doctor, you have left out some important factors of your problem." 
He said: "What are they?" "The words of the prophets; for the 
war will come. It has been predicted conditionally, and the conditions 



78 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



are such as to make its coming certain." And I heard the refrain of 
ancient prophecy : "Behold, I will proceed to do a marvelous work 
among this people, even a marvelous work and a wonder : for the 
wisdom of their wise men shall perish and the understanding of their 
prudent men shall be hid." 

BODY, MIND AND SPIRIT 

We recognize that a human being is more than a physical creation. 
The man who thinks otherwise is behind the times, in the first place, 
even in the matter of the fads and fashions of changing conjecture. 
Do you think you are nothing more than a makeup of bones and muscles, 
of nervous tissue and blood and other anatomical structures of your 
body ? You are more than that ! You know it, and the man who says 
he is nothing more really feels or fears that he is. He feels that he is 
something more than that, though he may try to persuade himself 
otherwise. There is something in this human frame of ours that 
existed before the body was formed. Some people have called it soul, 
spirit, mind, and some by names that are less common among us — 
gnome or devil ; but it is there. It is the immortal spirit that existed 
in the primeval kingdom, in its period of pristine childhood, before ever 
it came to take its place in this school of mortality, and to assume the 
student's garb of flesh. 

A man is more than body and mind ; he consists of body and mind 
and spirit, though we may regard the mind as being an attribute of the 
spirit. [ We know that our educators have risen above the thought that 
education should deal only with the mind. We have had intellectual 
giants developed among us who were of small practical use, compar- 
atively speaking, and some of them have proved a detriment and hind- 
rance to the progress of the race. We have had physical giants with 
the strength of huge animals but with minds dwarfed, and spirits 
shrunken and shriveled. 

SPIRITUALITY NEGLECTED 

Educators today are recognizing the need of symmetrical training, 
developing the body and the mind. But that would not be a sym- 
metrical education because aside from the mind, even though the mind 
be an attribute of the spirit, there is the spirit itself, and the race has 
not developed spiritually in due proportion. Let the evolutionists show 
to what extent man has developed spiritually during the last several 
centuries. And the fact that man has become unsymmetrical in his 
development is the all-important fact, I take it, lying at the basis of the 
disturbed conditions in society today. 

AN INSTANCE 

By the way, only yesterday I noticed an item regarding two great 
structures in the city of London, not very far apart, St. Paul's Cathedral, 
a triumph of architecture, a monument to the great architect, Sir 



ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE 



79 



Christopher Wren, and the Bank of England, in the same section of the 
city. It has been discovered that both those buildings are leaning 
over, their foundations seem to be sinking, with the possibility of their 
eventual fall, and capable engineers have been called into consultation. 

I noted that Professor Miles Wlalker, who is the president of the 
engineering section of the British Association for the Advancement of 
Science, had something to do with the consideration of that problem, and 
he draws attention to the fact that the cases in point are not the only 
kinds of displacement to be considered in this world of ours today — -the 
sinking of great buildings. He suggests that some of our social 
structures, spiritual structures, if you like, are sinking and coming out 
of plumb, and there is danger of their collapse. He proposes that the 
British Government organize an experimental colony to be managed by 
engineers — remember, he is an engineer and the president of the 
Engineering Section of the great British Association for the Advance- 
ment of Science — a colony to be directed by engineers, to demonstrate 
how far it is possible to maintain, say one hundred thousand people, 
with all the best of modern facilities of life, in a state of semi-isolation, 
separating them from conditions that bring about the "restraints and 
social errors of modern civilization." 

It is very interesting to note that the recommendation was over- 
whelmingly rejected and the great man was given to understand that 
science, in one sense, has already gone ahead too fast, and that the 
spiritual part of man has not kept up. One of our American news- 
papers, a leading one, the Philadelphia Public Ledger, makes comment 
on that in these words : 

"An ancient seer, who knew nothing of modern engineering or of the 
achievements of science laid down the rule that in a successful society men 
would do justly, love mercy, and walk humbly with their God. 

"Every Utopian experiment has failed because it has not stressed the 
spiritual side of life with its sense of social obligation and the need of unselfish- 
ness. They have ignored the weaknesses of human nature. 

"If Professor 'Walker were dealing with machines, his plan might succeed. 
Man, however, is not a machine. The experiment in Russia to make a machine 
out of him is slowly but surely breaking down." 

SUPPORT UNDER ADVERSITY 

"Man, know thyself." Oh, that we may know ourselves and know 
that we are children of the Eternal One, and that this body is a second- 
ary creation, a later construction, and that it is not the only thing 
about man, nor the principal thing, for the body will die — though 
surely it shall be resurrected — but the spirit can not die, and the spirit 
is really the man. 

Now, what is my religion doing for me under these conditions ? 
It should be a support. It should show me that notwithstanding these 
stresses and seemingly unfavorable forces there is purpose and plan 
in the experiences through which the human race is passing. It should 
teach me to be more considerate because of the suffering about me, in 
which perhaps I share, and to be more willing to help. It should 



80 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



teach me to be more tolerant, to be kind, to be kinder than I have been, 
and not to fight complainingly against the conditions that befall. You 
know that winter is coming by and by. Will you grumble and complain 
because of the ice and snow? It has to come, and the wise man will 
prepare for it. 

LIBERALITY TOWARD OTHERS 

My religion ought to teach me to have greater respect for my 
fellows, and to realize that this is the day of which the prophets have 
spoken, when all that can be shaken in the institutions of men shall be 
shaken. Are they not shaking all about us? Have your banks not 
shaken and fallen? Have your theories of philosophy not been found 
faulty? Have the conjectures of scientific men not been reversed, 
changed, and in some instances shaken to pieces? Only that which 
has been established by a power greater than man shall endure. 

My religion ought to teach me to regard my fellow as entitled to 
his views, as well as I am to mine, in matters political as in all else. 
I believe in men taking part in politics. We have to do so in order to 
function in government, even as has been said. But I say to you 
Latter-day Saints if- you, my brother, claim to be a Republican, be 
a straight, honest one. And if you, my other brother claim to be a 
Democrat, be a genuine Democrat. I know too many honorable Demo- 
crats to believe that all the good is in the Republican party, or the 
reverse. Some people even say: "Both can not be right." "Oh, is 
that so? Then if the Republicans are right the Democrats must be 
wrong." Would the proposition stand analysis? According to that, if 
the Democrats are good the Republicans are bad, out and out. Well 
now, I know good people and I know bad people, according to my 
mode of analysis, in both these parties, and I have been led to say 
sometimes that I think each is a little worse than — perhaps I should say 
better than — the other. Do not think because your neighbor does not 
vote your ticket that he is reprobate and bound for destruction. Do 
your duty as citizens, as I try to do mine, and do not feel that your 
neighbor is not entitled to his views. Do not let rancor and hatred 
find a place in your heart because of political differences. 

VALUE OF OPPOSITION 

Perhaps no greater truth was ever expressed than that revealed 
through the prophet Lehi : "It must needs be that there is an opposition 
in all things." As it is we sometimes have trouble in getting any 
considerable part of our citizens to the polls, and how many do you 
think would go if we had only one party and one ticket in the field? 
■There must needs be opposition. Let it be honorable opposition. Let 
differences of opinion be held in honesty. Oh, let us be men, remem- 
bering our divine origin, and conducting ourselves accordingly. 

May we go hence encouraged to greater effort, to endure and to 
meet what comes, in the right spirit, and to serve the Lord our God 
in our actions, as we profess to do according to the words of our 
mouths, I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER ANTOINE R. IVINS 



81 



ELDER ANTOINE R. IVINS 

Of the First Council of Seventy and President of the Mexican Mission 

I assure you, my brethren and sisters, that it will be an extreme 
relief for me to have this over and to sit in peace for the remainder of 
this conference. I have noticed that everybody who has sat close to me 
and been called on has felt just about as I have. I trust that the Lord 
will give me strength to bear to you a true and honest testimony and to 
say something that may be worth while, to encourage this congregation 
and to encourage me. 

I need encouragement as much as any single member of this Church, 
and I thank God that in the past he has come to my rescue when I 
have most needed his aid. I pray that as the future comes he will 
never desert me or desert you. 

I have enjoyed very much the words of this conference. I was 
especially pleased with what Dr. Harris said this morning about the 
youth of Zion. As Brother Hinckley told you this afternoon, our work 
as mission presidents brings us into direct contact with your sons and 
your daughters, and like Dr. Harris, I can bear testimony unto you 
that they are honest, true, sincere young people, and that the destiny of 
this work is safe in their hands. I feel it. I am sure of it. Of course 
it is our obligation to safeguard their growth and development that 
they may have this faith that is so necessary, that when they go into 
the world they may go in faith; that their lives may have been pure, 
so that they may be exemplary and be a light to the world. 

The results of their efforts depend very largely upon the example 
which they set. It matters not so much what their learning may be. 
God will give them words when the time comes, if they are faithful, 
so that they may answer questions and preach sermons that will touch 
the hearts of the people with whom they come in contact. Not all 
people are touched by the same thing. Not all people can be approached 
by the same missionary. So that it takes them all to make a world ; 
it takes them all to make successful campaigns in the mission field. 

Sometimes we have missionaries come to us and we wonder where 
we will place them and what they will do, only to find, after they have 
been in the field a short time, that their very humility makes them our 
most useful instruments. They find people that other more educated, 
more illustrious, perhaps, missionaries would never touch; and after 
all, this Gospel is for the meek and the lowly, the humble and the poor ; 
not, of course excepting the rich if they desire its benefits and blessings. 

We have heard of the depression. Wle feel it in the mission field. 
I have nothing but honor and respect for the fathers and the mothers 
of our missionaries, who are undergoing the sacrifice, the deprivation 
that is sometimes necessary to keep their sons and daughters in the 
mission field. They are heroes, these mothers and fathers. They have 
faith, and it is that faith that has made it possible for their sons and 
daughters to go into the field and preach and proselyte as they do. I 
could give you many illustrations of the sacrifice that has been necessary 



82 GENERAL CONFERENCE 



but that would perhaps be out of place at this time. But the parents 
are undergoing sacrifice, and I want those whose boys are in our mission 
field to understand that we appreciate that service to the very fullest 
and are grateful for it. 

These boys and girls are carrying to the world a testimony of the 
Gospel. It is the greatest thing in the world. If it could be given to 
the world so they would all understand it our troubles would soon 
disappear. That testimony we are trying to give them. 

The scripture has been read here in your hearing today, that 
eternal life consists in knowing God, the Eternal Father, and Jesus 
Christ whom he has sent. If we knew God we would serve him, and 
serving him we would gain eternal life. It is just as sure and certain as 
that dawn follows darkness. It is upon the testimony of God that 
we found our work. Christ asked his disciples, after he had lived 
and labored among them : 

"Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?" 

And in all his following there was perhaps only Peter that gave 
the answer that he desired : 

"Thou are the Christ, the Son of the living God. 

"And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: 
for flesh and Mood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in 
heaven. * * * And upon this rock I will build my church." 

What was it that was revealed to Peter? It was the identity of 
Christ as the Son of God the Father. He had been in their midst his 
lifetime, and there was none, perhaps, outside of Peter, that really- 
realized and appreciated who he was ; and Peter, during most of his 
association with Christ, had little idea of his real personality. "Upon 
this rock I will build my church" — upon the testimony that Christ is 
the Son of God, "I will build my church," is the way I like to interpret 
that. 

When the time came that Christ's church should be established 
among the Nephite people, which was far from its native home, Christ 
himself came down among them and ministered unto them. He showed 
them his personality, his being, and when he left they had a testimony 
that Christ was and is the Son of the living God. They passed through 
many vicissitudes, just as did our brethren on the eastern continent, and 
the testimony of Christ passed from them. 

The time came when it was necessary again to restore the Gospel 
to the earth, and the most important and all-embracing thing that hap- 
pened was a revelation to Joseph Smith of God the Father and Jesus 
Christ. "Upon this rock will I build my church," upon the testimony 
of God and Christ, his Son. 

That is the testimony that your sons and daughters are carrying 
to the world. That, to me, is the most important testimony that we 
have to give to the world, that Christ and God are real, actual person- 
alities, who have an interest in us and in our well-being. If we will 



ELDER ANTOINE R. IV1NS 



85 



adhere to that testimony and preach it boldly to the world — we do not 
have to do it in a manner that will offend, of course, but we must not 
fear to give that testimony when we go out — I am sure that in the 
end our purposes will be accomplished, that this work will prevail, that 
the great and glorious things that have been predicted of it will come to 
pass. 

May God grant this and carry us through safely, I pray, in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 

"Doxology" was sung by the congregation, after which Elder Joseph 
Reece, Patriarch, Hollywood Stake, pronounced the benediction. 
The Conference adjourned until 10 o'clock a. m., October 9. 



THIRD DAY 



MORNING MEETING 

Sunday morning, October 9. Every seat in the great auditorium 
and galleries of the Tabernacle was taken, and every available space 
in the aisles was occupied before ten o'clock. Hundreds of people who 
were unable to find accommodation in the Tabernacle occupied the large 
Assembly Hall on the Tabernacle grounds, where they listened to the 
proceedings as they were broadcast by radio. 

As a prelude to the fifth session of the Conference the following 
program of choral and organ music was rendered by the Tabernacle 
Choir and Organ and broadcast by radio from coast to coast over the 
Columbia Broadcasting System, through Station KSL of Salt Lake 
City: 

"Arise, O glorious Zion" — Choir. 

"To Thee, O Country" — Chaminade Chorus. 

"Kol Nidre" (traditional Hebrew melody) — Organ. 

"Choral Cluster" (Bach) — Choir. 

"Minuet" (Boellman)— Organ. 

"O be gracious" (from "St. Paul" — Mendelssohn) — Choir. 
"Pilgrims Chorus" (Tannhauser — Wagner) — Organ. 
"I praise thee, O Lord" ("St. Paul" — Mendelssohn) — Choir. 
The Choir was directed by Anthony C. Lund, with Edward P. 
Kimball at the Organ. Organ solos by Frank W. Asper. 

At the close of the broadcast President Anthony W. Ivins read 
the following telegram which he had received from President Heber J. 
Grant : 

"Sincerely trust you have had wonderful Conference, as I know you have. 
We will participate with you first half hour this morning. Ask Professor Lund 
to have opening hymn this morning 'An angel from on high,' next 'Let the 
mountains shout for joy.' Again our love and greetings to the Saints and my 
blessings upon the people everywhere. I 

Heber J. Grant." 

A duet and chorus, "An angel from on high," was rendered by 
Charles Martin and Ida Hepworth, and the Tabernacle Choir. 

Elder Wiilliam H. Haigh, Patriarch, Cottonwood Stake, offered the 
' opening prayer. 

The Choir sang the anthem, "Let the mountains shout for joy." 

ELDER REED SMOOT 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

My brethren and sisters, my heart is full of thanks to my Heavenly 
Father for this occasion. "What hath God wrought !" came to my mind 
as T was sitting here upon the stand, knowing that from this remarkable 



ELDER REED SMOOT 85 

building there went to all the world a program that would do honor to 
any people, for there is no civilized people in the world that could put 
a more religious, a more fervent program upon the air, praising God 
the Eternal Father. 

THE SAINTS IN WASHINGTON 

First, I want to extend the greetings of the brethren and sisters 
and your sons and daughters at Washington to the people of this 
conference. They no doubt are listening in to the program of this day. 
I can imagine seeing five or six hundred of them in the hall, listening 
to every word, and enjoying the remarkable musical exercise that was 
given here this morning. 

I want to assure the fathers and mothers of the boys and girls that 
are in Washington that they are as deeply interested in the welfare of 
the Church and are studying the principles of the Church, as well as if 
they were living in any community within the state of Utah. I think 
that the percentage of our young people and people in general in 
Washington who attend the services is as great if not greater than in any 
other place in the United States. 

TESTIMONY THROUGH PRAYER 

I thought this morning that I would refer to the question of 
prayer, for it is so ivital to a man and woman, no matter what position 
they hold, in order that they may maintain a testimony, if they have one, 
of the Gospel of Jesus Christ; and if they haven't yet that testimony, 
1 know of no better way in all the world to receive it than to plead with 
our Heavenly Father that it may be granted unto them. I know 
whereof I speak, because it was only through the humiliation of my 
soul and the prayers ascending to my God, at the request of the mother 
who gave me birth, that I received a testimony that this is God's work ; 
and every prediction made by the servants of God in any age since it 
was established upon this earth, shall be fulfilled. 

I often think, my brethren and sisters, of the hymn that we so 
often sing: 

Prayer is the soul's sincere desire, 

Uttered or unexpressed ; 
The motion of a hidden fire 

That trembles in the breast. 

Prayer is the burden of a sigh, 

The falling of a tear, 
The upward glancing of an eye, 

When none but God is near. 

Prayer is the simplest form of speech 

That infant lips can try; 
Prayer, the sublimest strains that reach 

The Majesty on high. 

Prayer is the Christian's vital breath, 

The Christian's native air; 
His watchword at the gates of death; 

He enters heav'n with prayer. 



86 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Prayer is the contrite sinner's voice, 

Returning from his ways, 
While angels in their songs rejoice, 

And cry, Behold, he prays. 

The Saints in prayer appear as one 

In word and deed and mind, 
While with the Father and the Son 

Their fellowship they find. 

Nor prayer is made on earth alone ; 

The Holy Spirit pleads, 
And Jesus on the Father's throne, 

For sinners intercedes. 

I think the American people, and perhaps the peoples of the great 
cities of the countries of the world, do not recognize the full benefit 
that prayer gives to the man or woman or soul that believes in God. 

THE EXPERIENCE OF GANDHI 

I was rather interested, my brethren and sisters, in what may prove 
to be the last words uttered by Gandhi. He came from far-off India 
to London, England, to plead with the English government to give 
his people, as he called them, more liberty, more assistance, and help 
the people in that far-off land to reach and learn, if possible, the things 
of God and what he desires in this world. The Indian leader makes 
this statement: 

"Prayer has saved my life. Without it I should have been a lunatic long 
ago. I have had my share of the bitterest public and private experiences. They 
threw me into temporary despair. If I was able to get rid of that despair it 
was because of prayer. Prayer has been part of my life, as truth has been. 
Prayer came out of sheer necessity. I found myself in a plight where I could 
not possibly be happy without prayer. The more my faith in God increased, 
the more irresistible became the yearnings for iprayer. Life seemed to be dull 
and vacant without it. I had attended the Christian religious services in South 
Africa, but they failed to grip me. My Christian friends supplicated God, but 
I icould not do so. I failed grievously. I started with a disbelief in God and 
prayer, and until at la late stage in life I did not feel anything like a boy in life. 
At that stage I felt that as food was indispensable to the body, so was prayer 
indispensable for the soul. ! In fact, food for the body is not so necessary as 
prayer for the soul, for starvation is often necessary in order to keep the body 
in health ; but there is no such thing as prayer starvation. You cannot possibly 
have a surfeit of prayer." 

Now, my brethren and sisters, from every word of that strange 
man it seems to me that the people over whom he has so wonderful a 
power, the peoples of India, are almost ready to receive the teachings 
of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Every Latter-day Saint knows that it 
is impossible for a man or a woman to enjoy the Spirit of the living 
God without supplication to him, asking him to forgive his short- 
comings and to assist him in his every-day walk of life. I want to 
acknowledge at this time that it was that mother of mine who taught 
me the lesson that it was necessary, if I ever expected to receive the 
divine blessings of our Heavenly Father, to learn to supplicate him for 
them ; and thank God I have followed it out.

THE CONDITION, RELIGIOUSLY 

What is the condition of the world today? Let me not say, although 
I think I know. I mean the condition of the world today as far as 
religion is concerned, so far as their belief in God is concerned. It is 
but a few years ago that Brother Widtsoe and |I visited Europe. The 
day that we were in Stockholm a great convention was held of the 
Christian church. I was very much interested in a statement that was 
made by Dr. Law of Brooklyn, and I think perhaps it would be proper 
for me to read it at this time. It may be enlightening to you, and I 
hope also to the good peoples of America and the world, for I think 
there is a great deal of truth in what the doctor said : 

"The Christian church has no message today for a dying world. As a matter 
of fact, the Christian church is preaching many gospels, and the result is confusion 
and failure," said the Rev. Dr. Curtis Lee Law of Brooklyn, in addressing the 
Baptist World Conference at Stockholm. "Denominations are being rent asunder 
today," he said, "and those who have long been brethren are in warring camps, 
contending not over non-essentials but also over the very foundation principles of 
Christianity. If this theological war is fought to a finish," he said, "at least the 
present generation will perish for lack of vision. 

"Believing in the sincerity and high moral character of these warring the- 
ologians," he said, "I beg of them, in the name of Christ and perishing humanity, 
that they will quietly, lovingly, prayerfully, gather about the table, with God's 
book before them, and let that settle every disputed question. That book is the 
ultimate ground for authority." So says the renowned doctor. 

THE POWER OF PRAYER RECOGNIZED 

Our government, in its beginning, recognized the power of prayer, 
for in the first gathering of Congress, the Senate and the House, prayer 
was offered before a thing was undertaken in the way of legislation. 
Among those wonderful men who met at Carpenter Hall on September 
5th, 1774, were some of the greatest Americans, men who were perfectly 
willing to give their lives for their country. They bowed in prayer, 
and more than half of them knelt when the prayer was being offered. 

The time was, my brethren and sisters, that you could go from one 
end of the country to the other and there was prayer in almost every 
home, no matter what denomination the people belonged to. It is just 
the reverse today. I plead with you, my brethren and sisters, I plead 
with you today, and I do it in the name of Jesus Christ, that you shall 
not forget to appeal to the Father in heaven, through the Master, for 
guidance every day of your life. America is a Christian nation and 
the great countries of the world are called Christian nations. Are we 
so living and are they showing by their acts and by their lives that 
they believe in the teachings of the Master? 

I believe that every prediction that has been made in relation to 
the destiny of the Gospel of Jesus Christ as revealed in this age, shall 
be fulfilled. I am proud, my brethren and sisters, to be one of those 
who preach the Gospel at least by their lives, and that is a wonderful 
way to preach it. I thank the mother that gave me birth that she 
instilled those principles into my very soul.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



May God's blessings ever be with his people. May his choicest 
blessings be over the nation, and may I also add, over all the civilized 
nations of the world, and may they humble themselves and live according 
to the teachings of the Master ; and if it were done — and I might add, 
it must be done before there shall be peace in the world. 

God bless you all, I ask, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

I assure you, my brethren and sisters, I feel most humble 
in standing here before this vast congregation and as I reflect 
upon the great miracle that we have witnessed this jmorning, in the 
broadcast from this ibuilding, which has gone out over the world. I 
feel grateful for every blessing that comes to |me and to us, as members 
of the Church, through the Gospel of Jesus Christ. We believe in 
peace. We preach peace. I hope we are living (in peace. 

men's hearts failing them 

After listening to the sayings of some of the world's great leaders 
and thinkers, as their expressions have been presented by some of the 
speakers at this conference, I am impressed -with the fact that the hearts 
of men are failing them. I think that is quite evident. We see it in 
publications in the newspapers and magazines and in the expressions 
of the people. The hearts of men are failing them. Fear has come 
upon the people of the earth. 

responsibility for the depression 

One of the brethren yesterday stated that practically every speaker 
up to that time said something about the depression. I suppose I will 
not be out of place if I too say something about it. I would like to iplace 
the blame for it where it belongs. It is so easy for humankind to blame 
somebody else for their own mistakes, and so easy for us, because of 
our human nature, to take credit when the thing that is accomplished is 
something that pleases and benefits. But we never want to shoulder 
a responsibility for our mistakes that do not please, and so we endeavor 
to place that kind of responsibility somewhere else and on others. 

When the children of Israel came out of Egypt they were led by 
Moses as he was directed of the Lord. Constantly they murmured 
against him when they found themselves confronting difficulties, and 
wanted to go back to Egypt to their tasks and to their tribulation. 

Now, brethren and sisters, let us shoulder our own responsibilities, 
and not endeavor to place them somewhere else. The responsibility 
for this depression is partly mine ; it is partly yours. It is the fault of 
the farmer, of the merchant, of the educator, the business man, the 
professional man — in fact, men in all walks of life. That is where the 
responsibility belongs. And why? Because of a failure to heed the 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 89 



commandments of God. I say it is partly mine. It is mine insofar as 
I may have failed to heed the commandments. It is mine wherein I 
may have failed to follow the counsels that have been given from this 
pulpit for many years. It is your fault because you too, perhaps, have 
failed to heed those counsels. It is the fault of the whole world, be- 
cause they have refused to hear the word of God, to heed the Warnings 
that have come from him, not only through ancient prophets and apostles 
but in the words that have been declared from time to time by modern 
prophets. 

HAVE FORSAKEN GOD 

The world today is full of selfishness, greed, the desire to possess. 
For many years we have been living extravagantly. Our wants have 
been supplied — not our needs alone, but our wants — and we have wanted 
much. Most of us have been able to obtain them, and now a time comes 
when we find ourselves somewhat curtailed, hedged around about, not 
having so many privileges, and our desires are not 30 fully granted, 
and so we begin to complain. But we should get rid of our selfishness 
and greed, our desire to possess that which is beyond the needs and 
blessings which are really ours. 

It is time for men to humble themselves, to repent and seek the 
Lord. I think the general theme of this conference has been that of 
repentance. I think it is most timely. I have been crying repentance 
up and down through the stakes of Zion for years. I think it is needed. 

Depression has come because we have forsaken God. Now, I am 
not speaking of the Latter-day Saints when I say that. I make this 
saying have general application. The people of this nation, and the 
people of other nations, have forsaken the Lord. We have violated 
his laws. We have failed to hearken to his promises. We have not 
considered ,that we were under obligation to keep his commandments, 
and the laws of the land as well as the laws of God are not respected. 
The Sabbath day has become a day of pleasure, a day of boisterous 
conduct, a day in which the worship of God has departed, and the 
worship of pleasure has ,taken its place. I am sorry to say that many 
of the Latter-day Saints are guilty of this. We should repent. 

Now, I am going to speak plainly. I have spoken plainly about 
this. I think it is a disgrace to our cities and to our state when play- 
grounds in this city and other cities are dedicated by city officials on 
the Sabbath day, and this day desecrated by ball games and other 
amusements. I think it is a disgrace to' the state when the state fair 
is opened on the Sabbath day. Now, this is not done because of the 
love of God. It isn't because we have in our hearts the love of him 
and a desire to keep his commandments that such has taken place. 
It is because of greed, the love of money, and because we have drifted 
from the truth, from the spirit of humility, and from those com- 
mandments which have been given to us for our eternal guidance. The 
Lord has spoken. He has spoken in these days and he has spoken in 
times of old. We should profit by the experiences of others. We ought 



90 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



to profit by the examples that have been set before us in ancient days, 
but it seems we will not do it. 

THE WARNING VOICE 

Now, we hear occasionally somebody make the statement that 
tilings are as bad as they could be, that they could not be worse. I 
want to> tell you they could be worse, a great deal worse. If I read the 
signs of the times we have not suffered yet as much as we are going 
to suffer, unless we repent. 

From this stand men have prophesied in the name of the Lord 
for many decades. President Brigham Young, President John Taylor, 
President Wilford Woodruff, and others of our leading brethren and 
presidents of the Church, have raised the warning yoice. They have 
called attention to these present conditions. The Lord has also pro- 
phesied of these things, and they have been mentioned by ancient seers 
and prophets. We have had ample warning. We have been told of the 
calamities that are coming. We have been taught how we might avoid 
them, how we might be protected, if we would only hear the counsels 
that come to us, heed the testimony of truth. If we fail, we cannot 
escape. 

FULFILMENT OF PROPHECIES 

I sat in this building at a general conference of the Church many 
years ago, in the days of President Wilford Woodruff, when he made 
a statement that I happen to have with me. Let me read it. President 
Wilford Woodruff was filled with the Spirit of the Lord. This hap- 
pened on the 4th day of October, in the year 1896. It was not the first 
time he had mentioned this matter, for he had mentioned it in 1893, 
and it became a theme in which he was very much interested and to 
which he gave expression in each, of his discourses, practically, until 
the time of his death. These are his words : 

"The revelations that are in the Bible, the predictions of the patriarchs and 
prophets who saw lb}' vision and revelation the last dispensation and fulness of 
times, plainly tell us what is to come to pass. The 49th chapter of Tsaiah is 
having its fulfilment. I have often said in my preachings, if the world want to 
know what is coming to (pass, let them read the revelations of St. John; read of 
the judgments of God that are going to overtake the world in the last dispensation ; 
read the papers and see what is taking place in our own nation and in the nations 
of ithe earth, and what does it all mean? It means the commencement of the 
fulfilment of [what the prophets pf iGod have predicted. In the Doctrine and 
Covenants there are many revelations given through the mouth of the Prophet of 
God. These revelations will all have their fulfilment, as the Lord lives, and no 
power can hinder it. In one of the revelations the Lord told Joseph Smith : 

" 'Behold, verily I say unto you, the angels are crying unto the Lord day and 
night, who are ready and waiting to be sent forth to reap down the fields : 

" 'But the Lord saith unto them. Pluck not up the tares while the blade is 
yet tender (for verily your faith is weak), lest you destroy the wheat also. 

1 'Therefore let the wheat and the tares grow together until the harvest is 
fully ripe ; then ye shall first gather out the wheat from among the tares, and 
after the gathering of the (wheat, behold and lo, the tares are bound in bundles, 
and the field remaineth to be burned,' 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 91 



"I want to bear testimony to this congregation, and to the heavens and the 
earth, that the day is come ,when those angels are privileged to go forth and 
commence theirwork. They are laboring in the United States of America; they 
are laboring among the nations of the earth; and they will continue. We need 
not marvel or ,wonder at anything that is transpiring in the earth. The world 
do not comprehend the revelations of God. They did not in the days of the Jews ; 
yet all that the prophets had spoken concerning them came to pass. So in our 
day these things will come to pass. I heard the Prophet Joseph bear his testimony 
to these events that would transpire in the earth. * * * We cannot draw a veil 
over the events that await this generation. No man that is inspired by the 
Spirit and power of God can close his ears, his eyes, or his lips, to these things. 
* * * There are many events before us and at our door, and they follow each 
other in quick succession. No power on earth or under the earth can stay the 
fulfilment of these things. You can hardly see them with your eyes, hear them 
with your tears, and feel them with your spirits. And when these strange things 
take place, no man should 'marvel and wonder at them, because they are in the 
great program. They have been decreed by Almighty God, and these things are 
only the beginning of sorrows." 

THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES 

On another occasion President Wilford Woodruff said : 

"What are the signs of the times? Do the Liatter-day Saints comprehend 
them ? This is a fast age. The Lord is going to cut his work short in righteous- 
ness. Read these revelations, for they contain the history of what is going to pass 
in the earth." 

He then quoted the parable of the Wheat and the Tares, and con- 
tinued : 

"What is the matter with the world today? What has created this change 
that we see coming over the world? Why these terrible judgments? What is 
the meaning of all these mighty events that are taking place? The meaning is, 
these angels that have been held for many years in the temple of our God have 
got their liberty to go out and commence their mission and their work in the 
earth, and they are here today in the earth. I feel bold in saying this to the 
Latter-day Saints. There is a meaning in these judgments. The word of the 
Lord cannot fall unfulfilled. If you want to know <what is coming to pass, read 
the revelations of St. John ; J-ead the Book of Mormon and the book of Doctrine 
and Covenants ; and these things are at our doors. What is the matter with this 
nation? Thousands of men striking, mobs rising up and destroying property, 
and tribulation prevailing! I want to say that you will all find before you are 
many years older that Utah is a pretty good place to live in. 

"So far as temporal matters are concerned, we have got to go to work and 
provide for ourselves. The day will come when, as we have been told, we shall 
all see the necessity of making our own shoes and clothing and raising our own 
food, and uniting together to carry out the purposes of the Lord. We will be 
preserved in the mountains of Israel in the day of God's judgment. I therefore 
say to you, my brethren (and sisters, prepare for that which is to come." 

BEFORE HIS SECOND COMING 

This time of trouble has not come yet; but it is on the way. I 
also have here — I cannot take time to read it — a statement from Pres- 
ident John Taylor, in which he bears witness to these things, and to 
the sayings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, that there shall be bloodshed 
and trouble in this land beyond anything that we have yet seen, because 
of the wickedness of the people. Do not think that we have reached 
a condition where things could not be worse. Unless there is re- 



92 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



pentance they will be worse. And so I cry repentance to this people, 
to the Latter-day Saints, to the people of this nation, and to the nations 
of the earth everywhere. 

In conclusion I give you this to think about, from the words of 
our Lord, written in regard to the times in which we are living, the 
times preceding his second coming. It is found in the twenty-first 
chapter of Luke. 

"Heaven and earth shall pass away : but ray words shall not pass away. 

"And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged 
with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come 
upon you unawares. 

"For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole 
earth. 

"Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to 
escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man." 

This is a good thing for us to think about as members of the 
Church, and I read this warning to us. May the Lord guide us, and 
may we repent. May we keep his commandments and walk in holiness, 
I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 

President of the Southern States Mission 

The Lord says concerning the missionaries and all those who are 
engaged in his service : 

"Verily I say, jnen should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many 
things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness ; for the power 
is in them." 

We cannot sufficiently appreciate the tremendous importance of 
this declaration. What power is in them ? It is the power of the Holy 
Ghost sent down from heaven, by which the missionaries work. "For 
when a man speaketh by the power of the Holy Ghost, the power of the 
Holy Ghost carrieth it unto the hearts of the children of men." 

The missionaries are fellow servants with angels/ — they are workers 
together with God and Christ for the salvation of souls. "So nigh is 
grandeur to our dust, so near is God to man." 

Three or four years ago I received a letter from a man who with 
his family has written his name high on the roll of Church workers at 
home and abroad. I quote from his letter : 

"The Southern people are my people. I know them. I am of them. As a 
family we can never repay the Church for the two weeks labor Elder John K. 
Lemon performed in our community, in the autumn of 1898. From this small 
beginning twelve of our family 'became members of the Church — I am referring 
to imy father's family only — and three of his sons have been honored with 
approximately ten years of missionary service in the Southern states, i The 
members who have associated themselves with the Church through their efforts, 
I have no record of, but in my weak way, and handicapped to a great extent, 
one hundred and five people have received baptism at my hands. There is no 
way for me to know the number brought into the Church through the missionary 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 



93 



labors of my two brothers. The only reason I refer to this is to call your 
attention to the apparently jendless chain system set in operation through the 
presentation of Mormonism to one family. The thought never occurred to Elder 
Lemon that such a body of recruits could be assembled in thirty years, counting 
those I know to ihave embraced the Gospel directly through my father's and 
mother's .family. All of the ten children are parents of from two to eleven, 
and the majority of the children are Latter-day Saints. Elder Lemon went 
hungry in our community, but thirty years later the brief review above shows 
that hundreds have been fed the bread of life on account of the seed of truth 
planted deeply in my father's heart. I wish it were possible to have every young 
man see, as I do, the far-reaching influence and probable results of one man's 
labors. 

"I am happy in the knowledge that my father and mother have been able to 
leave this sphere of existence with a testimony of the truth. , May God bless the 
missionaries of the South, (that they may find hundreds looking for the Gospel, 
as Elder Lemon found us." 

"The power is in them." Oh, how these words ring in my ears ! 
They echo in my heart, i They sound like a trumpet. As I associate 
with those fine young missionaries I have unbounded confidence in them, 
for the word of the Lord cannot fail. These devoted young men and 
young women are a credit to their homes, the Church and the nation. 
The following lines, fwith the substitution of two words, apply to the 
Church : 

"Mother of men grown strong in giving — 

Honor to him thy lights have Jed : 
Rich in the toil of thousands living, 

Proud of the deeds of thousands dead. 
We who have felt thy power and known thee, 

We in whose lives thy lights avail, 
High, in our hearts enshrined, enthrone thee, 

Mother of men," the Church ! 

May God help us in the Sunday School, in all the auxiliary organi- 
zations and in Church educational institutions, to develop in the youth 
this power and light with which God has fortified his disciples, I humbly 
pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS 

Of the First Council of Seventy 

The other day, on the sidewalk of one of our streets, I met a 
brother who was carrying a book, and as we stopped to exchange 
greetings he told me about it and showed me the title of it. The title 
was very striking because it awakened reflections and thoughts with 
which I had been dealing in my own reading for some time. The title 
which attracted my attention was: "Has Science Discovered God?" 
I went to the book store to obtain it, and since have read it, and find it 
to be quite a remarkable hook. The author of it was one named Edward 
H. Cotton, a Unitarian minister. He is responsible, however, only for 
the "Introduction" which is quite long. The writer presents himself as 
editor, rather than author. The Volume is a symposium upon this 



94 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



question, "Has Science Discovered God?" Sixteen famous scientific 
and philosophical writers make up the symposium. 

Among them is Robert A. Millikan, prominent physicist of Cali- 
fornia, and prominent in the intellectual thought of the times. His 
subject is "Christianity and Science." 

Arthur S. Eddington is another contributor, a prominent astronomer 
at Oxford, England. 

Another writer is Albert Einstein, physicist. "The Meeting Place 
of Science and Religion" is his subject. This man is perhaps the 
foremost mathematician of the world at the present time. 

"Religion, Its Persistence and Human Character," is by Julian S. 
Huxley, biologist, and a descendant of the famous Dr. Thomas H. 
Huxley of England, of the last generation. 

"The History of Science and Search for God," is by John Langdon- 
Davies, recognized rather as a philosopher than as a scientist; but his 
great work, "Man and His Universe," during the last two or three years, 
has attracted wide attention. 

"The Universe a Great Thought," by Sir James Jeans, a scientist 
and philosopher. He is the author of two recent really great books, 
"The Universe Around Us," and "The Mysterious Universe." 

Another contributor is Sir Oliver Lodge, one of England's fore- 
most scientists. His subject is "The Scientific Argument for Personal 
Survival." 

There are a number of others, but perhaps these will give you some 
idea of the great symposium upon this subject, "Has Science Discovered 
God?" 

As I read these several contributions to the subject, at the close of 
each I put to myself the question : Well, has science discovered God ? 
and I had to give a negative answer to this question. It is only fair 
to say, however, that the compiler of this work and editor of it really 
does not claim that science has discovered God, especially in the Chris- 
tian sense of God. 

But I wanted to go a bit farther than that and not only say that 
science has not discovered God, but to say also that I doubt if science 
ever will "discover God." I know how raw, perhaps, that sounds to 
your ears, and you will credit much of it to assumption. Well, be that 
as it may, I nevertheless, do not believe that science will discover God. 
That, as I understand it, is not the work assigned to science. Scientists 
may do much in confirming from their discoveries the existence and 
the power and the glory of God; but it will be God who will reveal 
God ; men will not find him "unto perfection" by their searching. It 
is the work of God to reveal himself and absolutely necessary that he 
should do so in order that we may have religion at all. 

Not only will science not discover God, but not even religion dis- 
covers him. It is not the order of the facts for religion to discover 
God. The order of the facts is God must reveal God. That is the only 
means by which God can be discovered to the understanding of men, by 
God revealing himself, his nature, his attributes, his relations to men, 



ELDER B. H. ROBERTS 



95 



and man's relation to him. That done through the revelation of God, and 
you have your basis for religion. The basis of man's duty to God, as 
well as God's relationship to the race of men. 

Science, I am happy to note, after long research is bringing back 
the conception of the existence of mind in the universe. Sir James 
Jeans, whose name I before referred to, presents the universe as "God's 
great thought." An Intelligence is operating within it, destroying the 
notion that the universe is merely mechanical, which prevailed up to 
some forty years ago. 

This is splendid to have science working along that line ; bringing 
to light that testimony is worth while. I rejoice in the light and 
understanding that seems to be coming into the conception of these 
leading scientists of the world in relation to intelligence, mind, 
thought, being connected with the universe, whose extent and grandeur 
and glory are constantly increasing. So far increasing, indeed, that it 
is held that the universe is outgrowing any possible conception of God 
being connected with it. 

One man who contributes a very thoughtful and splendid paper to 
this symposium said : 

"Who that is alive to the questions that can be asked can dare to pretend 
that science has destroyed 'the splendor of the heavens, or the glory of the 
universe ? The truth is that nobody has yet been able <to imagine a God splendid 
enough or glorious enough, aesthetically or ethically, to capture the imagination 
of man, once it rias become alive to iwhat modern science can show it lying 
about its feet or hanging over its head." 

So that the splendor and grandeur of the universe, in this man's 
thought, is that it exalts itself even above any possible conception of 
God, quite contrary to the conclusions of the inspired psalmist of Israel, 
who saw that "the heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament 
showeth his handiwork." So that science, in this man's estimation, leads 
away from any reasonable conception of God, for such a universe as 
science has revealed. 

It is not my purpose to prolong remarks along these lines. I 
merely want to place my hand upon the door of thought and open that 
door, that I may convey to you once more, as I have tried to do on former 
occasions, the glory and the mission to which God has dedicated his 
Church in these last days. I have said that God must reveal God, and 
indeed he has so revealed himself. He revealed himself to Adam and 
Xoah and Melchizedek and Abraham and Moses, and in the climax of 
things, through the Christ, for as St. Paul teaches us, Jesus Christ is 
the manifestation of God in the flesh. (See I Tim. 3:16.) He gives 
unbounded testimony to that fact. And in this New Dispensation of the 
Gospel, lo, God has revealed God, and committed the duty and responsi- 
bility to his Church to go forth and make proclamation of that revelation 
to the world. 

How he has honored this Church of the New Dispensation and the 
officers and priesthood of it, when he conferred upon them this high 
mission, to tell the world that God has revealed God, his nature, his 



96 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

personality, in the Father and in the Son and in the Holy Ghost ! He has 
called upon the men of the Church to bear witness of this truth. That 
is our peculiar position, and our peculiar duty and responsibility — to 
make proclamation of this great truth, to stand as witnesses for God 
before the world. 

Now I take my humble position in the line of God's witnesses in 
this dispensation, and say to you that I am sure of these truths, the 
truth that God has revealed himself as creating power, world-sustaining 
power, intelligence-inspiring power, and has revealed the Christ as the 
Redeemer of the world, through the resurrection of all men from death, 
and also as the individual Savior of men, through their obedience to the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ, bringing about the union and fellowship of man 
with God and sealing it by the witness of the Holy Ghost, a noble 
personal Spirit, who is dedicated to that service to bring home to men 
the fact of man's union with God. This testimony I leave with you 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

A solo and chorus, "The Recessional," was sung by Sister Jessie 
Evans and the Choir. 

Elder William H. Gibbs, Patriarch, Ensign Stake, offered the closing 
prayer. 

The Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock. 

AFTERNOON MEETING 

The closing session of the Conference was held Sunday, October 9, 
at 2 o'clock p. m. 

The Tabernacle was again fully occupied and many hundreds of 
people congregated in the large Assembly Hall on the Tabernacle 
Grounds, where they listened to the services as they were broadcast by 
radio from the Tabernacle. 

Sister Lula Christenson and the Choir sang the hymn "O my 
Father." 

Elder Hyrum M. Taylor, Patriarch, Granite Stake, offered the 
opening prayer. 

The anthem, "Song of the Redeemed," was sung by the Choir. 

ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

It is the Sabbath. We have met to worship. It is highly appro- 
priate of course, to pursue spiritual themes, yet I feel we need offer no 
apology when we deal with temporalities. Indeed in our conception of 
things all temporal affairs have spiritual significance. It runs in my 
mind to speak of some of these temporalities in the hope that the 
observations I may make may be constructively helpful to some of my 
brethren who find themselves in serious predicaments in the economic 
world.

SERIOUS EFFECTS OF FINANCIAL WORRY 

I have profound sympathy for the man who is in debt. I know 
that all honest men prize highly their good name, and I know that they 
would not willingly lose their reputation for fair and honorable dealing, 
and for the prompt discharge of their obligations. The man who finds 
himself in a situation where he cannot now discharge his obligations is 
subject to great anxiety and worry. Physicians tell me that no small 
part of the really serious maladies that come to men these days is 
superinduced by financial worry. The tragedies of money and financial 
collapse you read in the newspapers. The man who cannot pay his 
debts cannot sleep nights, not well at least. He is all the time appre- 
hensive and contemplates the complete loss of his property. In his 
imagination he sees his family thrown upon charity. He recognizes 
the difficulty of making a new start in the world, and the whole problem 
presents to him such an array of almost insurmountable difficulties that 
there are times when he reaches the very verge of despair. Unfortu- 
nately the man who is in such state of mind is not rare these days. Debt 
is prevalent. Few there are who can stand and say they owe no man. 

What are we to do in these perplexing situations ? I want to sug- 
gest a few ideas. 

NEVER REPUDIATE 

First, never repudiate. No man can retain his honor, the respect 
of his fellows and self-esteem who repudiates his obligations. The men 
of this Church in times past have enjoyed an excellent reputation for 
honorable dealings. It would be a serious reflection upon the good name 
of this Church if members in any large numbers, openly or secretly or 
willfully, repudiated their obligations. I recognize the fact that tempta- 
tion to repudiate them is sometimes almost overwhelming. Men reason 
thus : We contracted our debts on dollar wheat or eight dollar beets, on 
high priced cattle and sheep, when all commodities brought a good price. 
We are now obliged to pay those same debts without reduction in 
principal, on thirty cent wheat, on five dollar beets and on other com- 
modity prices that are so staggeringly low as to discourage the producer. 
But even though that argument may seem specious it is not sound, 
for a debt is a matter of honor in the last analysis and no man can 
afford to forsake his honor by repudiating a debt. I grant you that there 
may be circumstances under which one may be obliged by the very 
pressure of circumstances to avail himself of the relief that the law 
affords. I could wish that the law were changed. I understand there 
is a movement in congress and has been for some years, to change it 
so that no man will be permitted to take bankruptcy unless in the judg- 
ment of a court of equity it is equitable that he should. But until that 
law is changed, while it remains as it is, while a man may under the law 
discharge his obligations by going through that procedure I trust that 
no member of this Church will ever take advantage of it except under 
the utmost pressure he be forced so to do.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



SEE CREDITORS AND ARRANGE WITH THEM 

Secondly. While these conditions prevail and it remains impossible 
to discharge obligations with the resources at hand, another thing that 
I recommend that every debtor do is to see his creditors. After all, 
creditors are men, banks are men, and the lending companies at least 
ought to be impressed with the absolute necessity of making proper 
adjustments at these times. Many a debtor gets in bad with his creditor 
because he fails to see him. I know that he is often embarrassed, he 
would rather stay away. It hurts his pride to confess his financial 
inability to discharge his obligations. But the best thing he can do for 
the preservation of his own credit and for the adjustment of his situation 
is to see his creditor and arrange with him, and if every creditor as well 
as every debtor enjoyed a sound, merciful, considerate, kind, Christian 
philosophy there would not be great difficulty in arranging. I know 
that many creditors themselves are pressed and have felt the necessity 
of pressing their debtors, but this is a time when all need to be con- 
siderate and I have confidence that the intelligent creditor can arrange 
for extension and if need be for compromise and reduction of obliga- 
tions. If he is a wise creditor he will even find it is a very prudent 
thing to reduce the obligation so that the debtor may pay and thus 
maintain his honor and his self-respect. 

BY PERSEVERING AND CONSISTENT ACTION 

Next, do not wait for your ship to come in. The debtor who is 
waiting to discharge his obligations until he gets some big returns from 
some unassured proposition, is going to be a long time discharging his 
debts. I have no confidence in the ultimate outcome of a man's finances 
who is everlastingly waiting upon some happy event that will discharge 
all his debts and put him in the clear. Debts are only worked out by 
intelligent, persevering, consistent action. And I think that it is folly 
in these days for men either to hope for a return of those speculative 
clays which made tremendous paper profits, or for any such great change 
of affairs as will bring to anyone a large sum of money with which 
he can meet all the obligations that he may have rather unwisely incurred. 
Work, consistent application to one's vocation, if he is fortunate 
enough to have one, or his job, or his farm, or his business, may bring 
about in the end, although slowly, the desired results. 

BY MAKING NECESSARY ADJUSTMENTS 

When are times going to be better? Who knows? When are 
prices going to appreciate? Who can tell? How long may we have 
to raise wheat for thirty or forty cents a bushel? Who knows? Are 
we going to despair in the carrying forward of our several industries 
because we have no positive assurance that better prices will prevail? 
Now, it is an interesting thing these days to note that some businesses 
succeed and others do not. I think that a careful analysis of the situ- 
ation will indicate that the man who is able to make his affairs go 



ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 99 



forward these times is the man who is willing to make the sacrifices, the 
reductions and the adjustments that are essential to meet our present 
market. For one I am not persuaded that men cannot do business on 
a greatly reduced price scale with some advantage to themselves. I 
hope for better prices ; I hope for a speedy return of better conditions. 
It distresses all of us to see the misery that is caused to the people of 
the country by these abnormally low prices that now prevail. But I 
do not know when they are going to be better. I feel that our men 
should not look upon these prices and these conditions as insurmountable 
difficulties that prevent the continued operation of their businesses, and 
ultimately the successful outcome of them. 

EXTRAVAGANCE DEPLORED 

I despise waste, and I think that waste under present conditions is 
almost criminal — the waste of anything. Extravagance that amounts to 
waste is likewise indefensible in view of the great needs that present 
themselves. Sometimes I grow indignant when I see and contemplate 
the extravagances that are indulged by some of our institutions, both 
public and private when people are in such great distress and great want. 
There are extravagances in government that absorb all my own taxes 
and the taxes of my neighbors. These expenses are useless and un- 
necessary, some of them legalized it is true, but public service ought 
to be so alive to the situation that confronts us today that even if 
extravagance is legalized it should be stopped. A sense of the pro- 
prieties and a sense of fairness and justice would prompt such action. 

Our taxes are unbearably high because our incomes are so reduced. 
It is a tragedy to see the farms and the homes that are being sacrificed 
because of the inability of their owners to pay the taxes levied on them. 
Of course we want good government, we want the protection of law, 
we want all the opportunities that good government affords to us, and 
I recognize that they have to be paid for, but this is a day when economy 
must be applied. 

INVESTIGATION BY TAXPAYERS 

I am very sympathetic with the movement that I have heard is in 
progress wherein the taxpayers constitute themselves committees to 
investigate our public expenditures. No official of the government 
who has the right conception of his trust ought, in any sense, to resent 
an investigation of the administration of his office. I like the idea. I 
wish citizens everywhere would organize themselves and go to public 
officials and question them and ascertain whether or not it is not 
possible to make reductions in the excessive costs for which we are 
paying bills, for we pay them all. 

LIVING WITHIN OUR MEANS 

We talk constantly about balancing the budget. We are not bal- 
ancing the budget. Debts are mounting higher in our national admin- 



100 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



istration and I suppose in our state government as well as in our 
municipal governments. I recognize the fact that many municipalities 
are actually embarrassed because they cannot get the means with which 
to discharge their public obligations. It may be that such strenuous 
circumstances will be necessary to teach us that publicly as well as 
privately we have to live within our means, for there is just one way 
for every institution as well as every individual to get out of its or his 
debts and that is by spending less than we receive and applying the 
difference to the liquidation of our liabilities. That is the only way to 
get out of debt. It is a very simple process, and yet it is a very hard 
thing to do and requires a tremendous amount of stamina to undertake 
the job. 

THE NEED OF PRIVATE CHARITY 

Now these things I consider to be imperative for the relief of our 
distressing financial condition. I recognize that there are many these 
days to whom the application is very remote because there are some 
of our brethren and sisters and many people in the world who are 
without any source of income other than that which comes from charity 
to supply their needs. Of course the unemployed deserve and I believe 
that they receive our sincere sympathy, and they need not only our 
sympathy but our means, and I should like to say to the people here 
assembled that this is a time when, although the government and other 
agencies are doing all it seems possible to do . to relieve distress, private 
charity must still be called upon in large measure to meet the require- 
ments that exist. We cannot lie down and say that the relief funds of 
the government or our Church are going to take care of the situation. 
They are not, and we shall still be obliged to strain ourselves to the 
uttermost in order to supply that which is required. 

MATERIAL ASSISTANCE INDISPENSABLE 

Well, what has all this to do with religion? Why does this kind 
of talk find place, as I think it does, in such an assembly as this? It is 
because the man who has the religion of Jesus Christ in his heart cannot 
stand by and see the suffering of his fellows without being prompted 
by every emotion which is within him to come to their relief and to give 
assistance, and it is because the assistance that is so urgently required 
these days is material assistance. Material assistance is not only 
necessary for the relief of suffering and distress among the people, 
but that assistance is indispensable ultimately to the establishment of 
the great and glorious cause in which we have the honor to be engaged. 
The Church, fortunately, as President Ivins told us, is out of debt, but 
the Church needs money. The various facilities that the Church employs 
for the dissemination of this great work require money, the radio which 
broadcasts the messages of this conference, which gave us such an 
unusual thrill this morning, must all be supported by money. Our 
temples, our chapels, our great missionary cause itself, need money 
with which they may be prosecuted to a successful conclusion. We 



ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 



101 



haven't much money, we are poor these days. I agree heartily with 
those speakers who have preceded me in saying that we need to make 
up in spiritual fervor, in sacrifice, in renewed enthusiasm, for the want 
of our depleted resources, but we still need some money for this work. 
I know what these debts mean to the missionary service. I know there 
are thousands of homes in this Church who would rejoice to send out 
a missionary to the depleted ranks of our missionary force if they were 
not in the bondage of debt. They are mortgaged to their creditors 
and in consequence they cannot move to accomplish the things that 
they would like to do. 

I sincerely pray that God in his goodness will inspire every man 
to do the thing that his circumstances most require, to resist extrava- 
gances, to place himself on a careful, saving, economical basis that will 
ultimately free him ifrom this bondage of debt against which we have 
always been warned, that the men and the women of the Church may be 
free to devote their means, to consecrate the products of their lives to this 
high and holy cause which so commands our attention and our allegiance. 
God grant that it may be so, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 

First Counselor in the First Presidency 

I see in the congregation Dr. Elmer G. Peterson, President of the 
Agricultural College of Utah, who, for years, has had under his direction, 
as their tutor, large numbers of the boys and girls of the State. I am 
going to ask him to come to the stand and address us for a few minutes. 

DR. ELMER G. PETERSON 

President of the Utah State Agricultural College 

I shared with, all of you this morning, my brethren and sisters, an 
unusual emotion as we witnessed the nation-wide broadcast which 
emanated ,from this stand. I could not help thinking, as that nothing 
short of miraculous event transpired, of the very brief period of time 
which had elapsed since those first' companies of pioneers found their 
way over the forbidding desert, and through the equally forbidding 
mountains, to this historic spot now marked by the great edifice in which 
we meet and the other 'edifices on the Temple block. 

It has been only eighty years or so since those pioneer companies 
traversed practically half the continent, and I presume even the most 
visionary of them had little understanding of the tremendous significance 
of the developments which were taking place. Those developments are 
nothing short of revolution so far as human affairs are concerned, 
expressing themselves in a miraculous mastery by men of the forces of 
nature under the ministrations of science and the arts, and accomplishing 
also tremendous results of a social and secular character. 

The world, indeed, of which we are a part is now quite a different 



102 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



world from what it was when those first companies found their way 
here. Of course the miracle is not entirely in these evolvements of 
science, marvelous as they jare, but' in the fact also, I believe, that from 
those small beginnings there has arisen a great company of people 
actively devoted to the development of the truth. 

I happened to be teaching in the state of Oregon at one time when 
a prominent American leader came through that marvelous state. The 
people there of course were anxious to show him — it was Woodrow 
Wilson who was making the trip — the impressive natural resources of 
the state of Oregon — the fisheries, the great lumbering industry, the 
commerce, the orchards, mines and ranches; and Mr. Wilson — he was 
then a candidate for (the Presidency — indicated his great pleasure at 
seeing these resources. There happened to be in Oregon at that time 
a man who had attracted national attention because of the reforms 
which he was seeking to initiate in government and in social affairs. 
His name was Uren. He was seeking to bring back to the control of 
the people the great agencies of government and the agencies of service 
otherwise which in part, lamentably a large part, had departed from 
their control. Mr. Wilson said he was deeply interested in the forests, 
fisheries and other resources of Oregon, but he was infinitely more 
interested in what was, as he Expressed it, under Mr. Uren's hat. In 
other words he felt the spiritual need as superior to the material in the 
people's efforts to exalt themselves socially, politically and otherwise. 

Well, II am always impressed as I come to these gatherings of the 
Church, the like of which probably are not duplicated upon the face of 
the earth, by the unanimity of sentiment upon the things about which 
the people here are ithinking, by the powerful organization here for 
purposes of righteousness, by the positiveness with which the working 
of good is undertaken, all manifestations of spiritual undertaking. 

There are of course two bases of testimony of any religious work. 
There is the basis of faith, which is not much to be argued about. It 
is a matter of possession or non-possession. 1 Such things, for instance, 
as the reality, the actuality, or otherwise of that great event which 
transpired in the Sacred Grove. Now a person believes that or he does 
not believe it, or he is in process of developing a faith in it. But after 
all, this event and other comparable events such as the miraculous 
manifestation to Paul on the road to Damascus, the occasion when 
Moses came down from the mountain and reported the event which 
resulted in the code known as the Ten Commandments, not replaceable 
even in this modern complex and learned age by the man-made com- 
pilation of laws — these things are matters of faith. However profound 
our belief may [be in them — and the event in the Sacred Grove takes 
its place in history with the other events which I have mentioned — they 
are matters of faith and not subject to the same scientific analysis as 
are other aspects of religion which are not matters of faith but which are, 
nevertheless, bases of testimony. Not being subject' to analysis or 
scientific proof in no sense invalidates these great occurrences. My 



DR. ELMER G. PETERSON 103 

own confidence in them is as complete as though they were phenomena 
admitting of direct analysis and proof. 

My life has been spent largely in dealing with (young people. As 
we all know, the greater deductions and generalizations which set 
themselves up in people's minds, usually as a result of (long periods of 
time and of experience, are not, frequently, the possession of youth. 
The young look usually for those things which are called scientific, 
which might be called rational. Not that these other great manifestations 
are not rational if we had a deeper knowledge of ithings — indeed, in 
some ways, disbelief in them is one of the greatest irrationalities even 
with our present knowledge ; yet there are foundations for the develop- 
ment of our own faith that are eminently rational; and I have found 
that these are reliable things upon which to build (the faith of the young 
in a religious or in an ethical or social or any other similar way. 

I was once talking with a young member of the Church who had 
spent some time in study in the East in a professional school ; and he 
remarked while on his way back to take up his "practice in a neighboring 
state that one of the things the Church would have to do was to get 
away from the old practice which he associated with what we call temple 
work, ancient devices and practices which civilization, he said, had 
long since outgrown. He was asked what, in his judgment, was the 
most prevailing weakness in the society with which he was so familiar 
in the place where he had studied, one of Jour large cities. He said 
he thought that possibly the greatest weakness there as elsewhere in the 
centers of population was a breakdown, in the relations of the sexes, 
that promiscuity had succeeded chastity, and that the standards of fidelity 
in family life that' had been taught to us as an integral part of Christian 
belief were falling down pitiably in what we call civilization. As our 
discussion revolved around the question of temple ordinances and the 
care and sacredness which guard the great relationships of sex, relation- 
ships which are the very source and fountain of life itself, it was asked 
if after all, aside entirely from the spiritual realities which underlie 
temple work, the safeguarding of these relationships .was not sufficient 
to justify every expenditure and every energy which goes into this 
sacred work? 

Here :is a rationality that is clearly obvious, rational of course 
because it has a deep spiritual significance as a basis. There are many 
others. 

One of the weaknesses of present government is a breakdown in 
what we call democracy ; and the great peoples of Europe, from whom 
practically all of this audience have come, are looking about for a 
substitute, and some of them are trying substitutes by way of dictator- 
ships and what 1 not. They are anxious to find a cure for the weaknesses 
that have expressed themselves in democratic institutions. Indeed, in 
the thought of many observers, democracy is on trial. It does not 
require very extensive analysis to reveal that among the many ration- 
alities of Mormon faith, our own faith, is that which expresses itself 
in the essential democracy which pervades this great organization. I 



104 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



doubt if anywhere upon the face of the earth a congregation with 
greater individual self-respect could be assembled than this congregation 
here, where the sense of the actuality of brotherhood, which is the essence 
of democracy, exists in such abundance that there is no doubt in the 
minds of the humblest, as well as all jothers in this congregation, as to 
the equality of privilege and opportunity which he shares with every one 
else in this great social union, and as it applies to our own Church this 
great priesthood. 

A careful thinker, after living some time in the state teaching in 
one of our institutions, once asked me why it was that there were no 
hereditary ruling families developed in the history of the Church; and 
I expressed the opinion, which I had not very carefully thought out, 
that one reason for it was that there was such actuality in the brother- 
hood which existed in the Church that those families instead of tending 
to intermarry within themselves disseminated their strength throughout 
the body of the Church. 

Rationality expresses itself in the processes which relate to the 
Word of Wisdom, sometimes considered a more or less extreme doctrine. 
One of the dangers of our present civilization is the danger of indulgence, 
expressing itself in addiction to drugs of a terrible and devastating 
character, an indulgence that threatens the very virtue of modern society. 
A person who observes the Word of Wisdom is free from the danger 
of addiction to drugs. If the preachment called the Word of Wisdom 
had no other value than to keep at least five, six or seven hundred 
thousand people free from the withering curse of addiction to the more 
deadly narcotics and other drugs, that great doctrine would have 
justified itself. 

Of course these and similar doctrines that could be mentioned 
are not negative. They are not primarily for the sake of preventing 
people from doing bad things. Their great virtue consists in the fact 
that they build up individually and thus socially strength which becomes 
a powerful weapon for righteousness. These things have appealed to 
me as I have analyzed the doctrines of the Church which constitute a 
philosophy, aside from the religion, the spirituality that is in the doctrine, 
a philosophy so profound that it is beyond the comprehension of the 
most learned and the most intellectual, a profound formula for the living 
of clean and wholesome lives, and infinitely more than that of course, a 
formula by means of which a people united together can preserve and 
build up those great strengths that hold out the possibility of finding 
expression in the fulfilment of the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth, 
the exaltation of mankind. 

It would not be proper for me to occupy more time. I rejoice with 
you in the accomplishments which represent themselves here individually 
in this audience and in the many, many thousands more who are listening 
in today, in the social cleanliness which is expressing itself, and in the 
militant organization which exists here for continuing the battle of truth. 

May God bless us to be worthy of this great fellowship I humbly 
pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY IV. IVINS 105 

A solo, "The blind plowman," was sung by Brother Melvin Watson, 
who is blind. 

PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 

First Counselor in the First Presidency 

This is the last session, my brethren and sisters, of the conference. 
I have been reminded of the scripture that [I am about to quote. 

It is now more than 2,000 years ago since the Lord called the 
Prophet Ezekiel, the son of Buzi, commanding him to go and proclaim 
his word to the house of Israel. The Israelitish people had departed 
from faith in the God of their fathers and had turned to the worship of 
idols. Ezekiel, in obedience to the commandments of the Lord, went out 
to the people jwho dwelt upon |the river Chebar and abode with them 
seven days. He was amazed at their wickedness, their idolatry, and he 
hesitated, reluctant to deliver the message which the Lord had com- 
manded him to take to them. 

EZEKIEL REBUKED 

At the end of that time the Lord rebuked him and said to him : 

"Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel : there- 
fore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me. 

"When I say lunto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die ; and thou givest him 
not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his 
life ; the same wicked man shall idie in his iniquity ; but his blood will I require 
at thine hand. 

"Yet if thou warn the wicked, land he turn not from his wickedness, nor from 
his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul." 

RESPONSIBILITY OF LEADERSHIP 

I have often read these words of the prophet and have asked myself 
this question, What is their application to you ? What is the responsi- 
bility that you are under in the capacity which you occupy in the 
Church and in the nation ? The answer has always been the same. It 
is this, that whatever my profession, whether it be as a citizen of the 
government to which [I have given allegiance, or a member of the Church 
with which I am affiliated, it becomes my duty to magnify in my life and 
to teach others to do so, the ideals f or which my country stands, and 
the creed which my Church teaches. If I fail in this and lead others 
away from loyalty to their country or (devotion to the truths of religion, 
I assume the responsibility of not only being a violator of the laws made 
for the protection and temporal welfare (of the citizens, but of the law 
of God which has been given to us for the salvation of our souls. 

This places upon Ime, if I properly understand it, and upon every 
other person who assumes the responsibility of leadership, whether it 
be in the Church or state, a tremendous responsibility, a responsibility 
which J always feel when I stand before a congregation of my brethren 
and sisters, as I do now, upon occasions of this kind, and I always feel 



106 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



the necessity of dependence upon the Lord and (upon you, my brethren 
and sisters, for help. 

A [MARVELOUS CHANGE 

This is a congregation of people composed almost exclusively of 
members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, com- 
monly (known to the world as Mormons, i We are here in a building- 
known throughout the world as the Mormon tabernacle. We are listen- 
ing to an organ the tones of which have become known throughout the 
world. We are here in an environment of flowers, of trees, with beauty 
and peace all around us. I remember a time when this Mock of ground 
on which these buildings stand, where these trees grow, these flowers 
bloom, was a barren waste. I have played upon this block when there 
was not a shrub or spear of grass on it. It was a gravelly part of the 
bed of City Creek. I have seen it grow from that time until now. 
I knew the men who were the builders of it. We are now in a city 
which we call Salt Lake, in a state which we call Utah, now one of the 
48 states of the confederation which constitutes the United States of 
America. Only yesterday there was no tabernacle, no flowers, no Salt 
Lake City, no State of Utah; and going back just a little farther, only 
yesterday, as time ticks off its moments, and hours, and days, and years, 
and aeons, there was no government of the United States of America. 

THE MORMON PIONEERS 

What is it that has brought this about ? Why is this great congre- 
gation of men and women assembled here this afternoon ? Anglo Saxon 
men and women as a rule, people whose forefathers many of them laid 
or assisted in the laying of the foundation upon which our government 
rests. I knew these men and women as perhaps few men now Jiving 
knew them. This Mormon Pioneer, I knew his faith, I knew his in- 
dustry, I knew his integrity, I knew his devotion to the government of 
which he formed a part, for he believed that it was ia Cod-given govern- 
ment. He knew that it was not alone the doing of men, that had brought 
him to this forbidding looking country, and yet in its ruggedness and 
its barrenness grand beyond comprehension. And so he toiled on. When 
difficulties confronted him he prayed to the Lord for light and strength, 
and then went out and did the thing that was required of him. Pro- 
foundly religious he held in reverential respect the religion of other men. 
He knew that other people found God in temples built with hands, just 
as he found him here under the stars where he worshipped in those 
early days. 

I think of those men, I think of their statesmanship. They were the 
peers of any of their time, intellectually, educationally, largely men who 
had come from the New England states of our republic, the descendants 
of the Pilgrims whom the Lord brought there, and it was He who 
brought them here. They knew it. 

DESTINY FORETOLD 

I shall not take time to go back and prove to you the truth of Elder 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W . WINS 107 



Talmage's remarks of yesterday. This country in which we live had 
been declared by the prophets thousands of years ago to have 'been given 
by God our Father to the covenant people of Israel. The coming of 
Columbus was not a thing of chance. The prophets predicted his coming 
ages ago. He came here under the inspiration, the impulse, unknown 
perhaps to him, of the Spirit of the Lord, just as we are led to do many 
things without just knowing the reason why, for the accomplishment of 
a divine purpose. The establishment in this country of a government 
to which the oppressed of all nations should come for jrefuge, for free- 
dom. He declared that no kings should ever rule here, centuries before 
Columbus sailed from the port of Spain. l He told the history of this 
country, its past, its present, and declared its future destiny, just as 
definitely as he declared its past history. 

What is that destiny ? It is that this government of ours shall persist ; 
it shall continue ; it shall never be thrown down ; no enemy that comes 
against it shall ever triumph — upon this one condition, that the people 
to whom the Lord has given these bounteous blessings ; these miracles 
which have Jcome to the earth during my lifetime, these people who 
have grown from an exceedingly small beginning to be the wealthiest, 
perhaps the most important in influence — I believe I am justified in 
saying it — that there is in the world — upon condition that they serve 
the Lord of the land, who is Jesus Christ. 

GOD, THE AUTHOR ,OF IT 

Where much is given much is expected. This land, to God our 
Father, is a chosen land, dedicated as I have said to the principle of 
liberty and freedom, not license. 

Our fathers, under His inspiration, gave us the constitution of our 
country, the bill of rights which defines our privileges and places limita- 
tions beyond which we may not go. Liberty, when carried to the 
extreme, results in license. I want to impress upon this congregation, 
my brethren and sisters who are here, that the Lord our God has been 
the author of it all. It was he who led you from your native lands. 
You people from the green fields and lanes of England, you did not 
leave your homes because you did not love your native land. You had 
fought for it, defended it, and were ready to fight for it again. You 
people from Scotland, you people from Ireland and Wales, from Ger- 
many and the islands of the sea, oh if I only had the time to go back 
and tell you I could show you that the whole story of your lives had been 
written by the finger of God. 

So we are here ; here, thank the Lord, citizens of the best govern- 
ment in the world. We are here, members of the Church of Christ our 
Lord which has (been restored through the medium of heavenly messen- 
gers who had authority to give to men upon earth, the keys of the holy 
priesthood. What for? For the redemption of the human family. 
Whether men (believe it or not these things are true, and ultimately they 
will believe it, and there is no power either in earth or hell that can 
stay the progress of the Church, unless its people grove recreant to the 



108 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



covenants that they have entered into with our Father who is in heaven. 
Just so, there is no power that can wreck the government that God has 
established in this country unless it be the people themselves, and that 
I do not expect nor believe can occur. 

BY THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD 

The Lord in his scripture tells us that no one can come to this land 
unless he be brought or directed by the Spirit of the Lord, and so he 
has brought this people here. He brought the faith of Ithe devoted 
Puritans of New England; he brought the patriotism of the Dutch at 
New York; he brought the gallantry of the cavaliers of Virginia; the 
light-hearted energy of the French of New Orleans. Just the kind of 
composite body of men to establish a government that could not be 
dominated by any particular race or tongue, but made composite, that 
all men might be welcomed to it, live under and enjoy its privileges. 

ARMY THREATENS 

And so the government has struggled on. From the very beginning 
the ship of state has been at times upon a stormy sea. With the dis- 
missal of the army after the surrender of Lord Cornwallis at.Yorktown 
the soldiers were discharged. .There was no money with which to pay 
them. They were in open ;revolt. Generals in the army accused Wash- 
ington of being the author of all their troubles. They would have made 
him king and disregarded the confederacy of states which formed the 
Union. , They threatened to march against the Congress which was in 
session at Philadelphia, and it became necessary to remove it to Princeton. 

Now let me read something that I want you to hear. While these 
men were assembled together in secret conclave, Washington unex- 
pectedly walked into the room where they were seated. Fiske says : 
"Washington suddenly came into the meeting and amidst profound 
silence broke forth in a most eloquent and profound speech. All were 
hushed by that majestic presence and those solemn tones. He pleaded 
for tolerance, for patience, for trust in the newly born government which 
would in the end pay them that which it owed. They listened, the 
soldiers listened, hesitated and yielded to the irresistible presence of the 
man who more than any other had made the establishment of the nation 
possible." 

I revere this man. To me he has been a man of destiny, a prophet 
if we have ever had one. I read frequently his last address to the Amer- 
ican people. It is a treasure house of wisdom, of prophecy, of political 
philosophy. 

PERPLEXING SITUATIONS 

Our government is now very much in the condition that it was at 
that early time. Demands are made upon it which, are exceedingly 
difficult to comply with. The soldiers of our country are in an ugly- 
mood because their requests are not granted. : The resources of the 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 



109 



country are not sufficient to meet the demands made upon it, notwith- 
standing the great increase in taxes which has recently been levied. 
The bulletin boards, while this conference has been in session, have 
announced that the budget of the government is still (five hundred million 
dollars short of balance. What is the result going to be ? I do not 
know ; I do not want to assume the responsibility of indicating, but I 
do know that there are some, things which will help. I do know that 
Elder Richards this afternon has declared to you in jplain terms some 
of the things that must be accomplished. There is about ten billions of 
dollars of gold in the world. Our national debt is twenty billions of 
dollars. What the debt of other nations of the world is I do not know, 
I have not taken , the time to determine, but this I do know, that the 
World war cost about two hundred billions of dollars, and that does not 
take into consideration the amount which was paid for the restoration 
of property destroyed, nor does it take into consideration the fact that 
I believe nearly ten millions of men, if J remember the figures correctly, 
were either killed or permanently disabled and taken away from the 
forces which create the industries of the world. So that altogether I 
calculate that at least two hundred and fifty billions of dollars was the 
cost of that great war. Will the debt ever be paid ? It never will. That 
goes without saying. Some part of it may be, I -do not know. No one 
will deny .the fact that the government at present is confronted with 
perplexing situations, questions of great import. How they are to be 
solved men appear not to know, and I do not know. One thing that 
I do know, is that the American people are capable of solving these 
problems if the voice of the 'people could be heard. I have faith in the 
soul of these American people which God has brought to this land. He 
has said, and I am only repeating his words, that the nation shall persist, 
that it shall be able to meet any emergency that shall arise if it will only, 
as I have stated, have faith in the God of the land, who is Jesus Christ. 

DISREGARD FOR LAW 

It appears to me that three things are more responsible than all 
else for our present condition. The first is the unusual disposition upon 
the part of many of the citizens of our country to disregard the obliga- 
tion of obedience to civil law. I do not heed to quote these notes that 
I have here to show you that in the opinion of the best thinkers of our 
country, chaos hangs over it unless something can be done to restrain 
crime and the open violation of law which exists in the United States 
today. Criminals sit upon juries where their own friends are being 
tried, while business men and others who should be there decline or 
avoid such service. Murder is committed in the light of day. Murderers 
and thieves are released from jail or from courts by habeas corpus 
many times before the prisoner ever reaches the bar of justice. Lawless- 
ness is in every city of the land. Wicked men go out in the darkness 
at night like animals of prey, here in our own Icity, seeking whom they 
might devour, preying upon the innocent and unprotected. The officers 



110 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



of the law do the best they can to prevent it. We who are citizens pay 
too little attention to it and give them too little support. Just as long 
as prominent men in our nation, bankers, merchants, business men, con- 
gressmen and legislators ignore the law themselves, how can they expect 
that this condition can be overcome ?i Do I exaggerate when I say that 
men are elected to office who are unworthy, and never should have been 
chosen? Every man who goes to the Congress of the [United States 
holds up his hand and covenants with God that he will obey the Consti- 
tution of our country, and then frequently he goes right out and violates 
it. It applies to men who are sent up to our legislature. They enter 
into that covenant and then disregard it. I know how I should feel if 
I did a thing of that kind. I would know that I was a perjurer and I 
would expect to be impeached and sent home where I belonged. Some 
such method as that will have to be adopted before our house cleaning 
will be complete. 

DISREGARD FOR RELIGION AND PURSUIT OF WEALTH 

In conclusion, let [me read some quotations that I have made from 
this man whom we refer to as the father of our country. I said there 
were three things responsible for this spirit of lawlessness. Another 
one is the disregard of religion that is gradually but surely manifesting 
itself among the people. Enough has been said in this conference to 
satisfy you that this is not an idle statement that I am making. These 
sheets that I have before me are covered with statistics that corroborate 
the truth of what I say. The next thing to be avoided is the unbridled 
and unreasonable pursuit of wealth which has characterized the people 
of the United States ever since the World war terminated. I expect 
that we have made more millionaires — Senator Smoot will know whether 
I .state it correctly or not — I suppose we have made more millionaires 
in the United States since the war than existed perhaps altogether before 
(Senator Smoot confirmed this statement). What does that mean? It 
means that whenever you multiply millionaires tribulation comes to 
someone, and as this selfish desire for the accumulation of wealth has 
gone on among certain people and in certain sections other people have 
become poorer and poorer, until we have at last reached the crisis in 
which we find ourselves today. 

QUOTES WASHINGTON 

Washington in this address to which I have referred, and I wish 
every member of the Church would read it — -not only read it but make 
it a part of the governing rule of his life — says : 

"Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, religion 
and morality are indispensable supports. In vain would that man claim the 
tribute of patriotism who should labor to subvert these great 'pillars of human 
happiness, these firmest props of the duties of 'men and citizens. The mere 
politician, equally with the pious man, ought to respect and cherish them. A 
volume could not trace all their connections with private and public felicity. Let 
it simply be asked — " and I ask it of you — '"Where is the security for property, 
for reputation, for life, if the sense of religious obligation desert the oaths, which 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 111 



are the instruments of investigation in courts of justice? And let us with 
caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion. 
Whatever may toe conceded to the influence of refined education on minds of 
peculiar structure, reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national 
morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle." 

Another basic principle: "The basis of our political systems is the right of 
the people to make and alter their constitution or government. But the constitution 
which at any time exists, till changed by an explicit act of the people, is sacredly 
obligatory upon all. The very idea of the power and the right of 'the people to 
establish government presupposes the duty of every individual to obey the 
established government. 

"All obstructions to the execution of the laws, all combinations and asso- 
ciations, under whatever plausible character, with the real design to direct, control, 
counteract or awe the regular deliberation and action of the constituted author- 
ities, are destructive of this fundamental principle, and Of fatal tendency. They 
serve to organize faction, to give it an artificial and extraordinary force; to 
put, in the place of the delegated will of the nation, the will of a party, often a 
small but artful and enterprising minority of the community; and, according to 
the alternate triumphs of different parties, to make the public administration the 
mirror of ill-concerted and incongruous projects of faction, rather jthan the 
organ of consistent and (wholesome plans digested by common counsels, and 
modified by mutual interests." 

RESPONSIBILITY OF CITIZENSHIP 

I am going to ask you this question, and ask it in plainness, because 
it appears to me to be a vital one, and if jl stand here and express a 
thought that is wrong, nevertheless believing it to be solemnly right, 
then I have justified myself as Ezekiel did when he went down to the 
house of Israel. I am asking myself this question : Is there not some 
responsibility resting upon the citizenship of the United States because 
of the indifference they have manifested, particularly during the past 
decade, in regard to those who are to represent them in the Congress 
of our nation, the legislatures of our states and the boards of direction 
in the municipalities of those states and counties ? 

I believe I will say it — I believe that in many instances we have 
become so accustomed to and so committed to party rule, to arrange- 
ments made by professional politicians, regardless of the real voice and 
desire of the people, that we have felt it our duty to follow them whether 
they are right or wrong. Just a word of solemn warning : I say to you 
regardless of party politics, regardless of your past affiliations, in this 
time of extremity, and it is a time of extremity, see to it that honest men, 
wise men, capable men are sent to represent you in the organizations of 
the country, the bodies which formulate our laws and appoint the men 
who administer them. You know that the constitution , of the United 
States gives Congress certain privileges and rights. There are certain 
other sacred privileges and rights that it does not confer upon them 
and that they should not be permitted to overstep. They formulate and 
pass the laws which govern our lives, control pur property, proclaim 
peace or war. The administration of those laws that they pass is limited. 
The administration goes to the administrative bodies. 

FEARS PATERNAL GOVERNMENT 

I fear this, that under existing conditions we are gradually drifting 



112 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



i 



toward a paternal government, a government which will so intrench itself 
that the people will become powerless to disrupt it, in which the lives 
and liberty of the people at large may be jeopardized. They are pouring 
millions of dollars in this time of need into sources for the benefit of the 
people and it is a great benefit and perhaps salvation, but it is going to 
result in this — I am going to make this statement — that if the present 
policy is continued it will not be long until the government will be in 
the banking business, it will be in the farming business, it will be in the 
cattle and sheep business, for many of these debts will never be paid. 
That will mean the appointment of innumerable agencies. The govern- 
ment now is overloaded with commissions and agencies, some of them 
administering the very laws that Congress itself has enacted. Someone 
else should be administering those laws. If you want to save yourselves 
from the bondage of debt and political influences which are not of your 
own choosing I ask you to think of what I have said. 

LEGISLATORS OF EARLY DAYS 

Oh, I remember those old legislative bodies which assembled in 
Utah. I knew the men that were in them. They were men of faith, 
men who taught me faith in a living God, that he is the same good 
heavenly Father that he ever was and will watch over and bless righteous 
people wherever they are. They taught me obedience to the laws of my 
country. They taught me patriotism to my country and to this govern- 
ment of which I am speaking ; that it was dearer to me than life itself ; 
that it should be defended ; that it should be protected, not only from 
enemies from without, but enemies from within. They are the most 
dangerous enemies of all. And I have never seen a moment in my life 
that I did not stand ready to give it that protection. I am ready now, 
as old as I am, and I always have been, not only to say the thing but 
to do it. I will not be walked over rough shod by the lawless element 
that is now seeking to get control of this country. 

GIVES BLESSING 

God bless you, my brethren and sisters, keep you in the path of 
rectitude, keep you true to the Church, to the state and to each other, 
and some means will come by which we will be able to pay these debts 
and relieve ourselves. We may be leveled down before that, and I do 
not know but that would be a good thing. We would all be very much 
alike. The prophet Isaiah tells us that it shall be "as with the people, 
so with the priest ; as with the servant, so with his master ; as with the 
buyer, so with the seller ; as with the lender, so with the borrower ; as 
with the taker of usury, so with the giver of usury to him." And we 
are nearing that condition now. I do not know who is the worse off 
today, the banker who is lending money, or the person to whom he 
lends it. 

God bless you, is my humble prayer, through Jesus Christ. Amen.

THE FALLING AWAY 

By B. H. ROBERTS 

This new work is a ringing challenge to Christendom and a frank 
indictment of the multifarious creeds that are an outgrowth of the disin- 
tegrated Apostolic Church. It shows most conclusively and brilliantly that 
all the churches had departed from the true pattern of Christ and lost the 
authority completely, long before the New Dispensation was ushered in 
through the instrumentality of Joseph Smith. 

Yet the motive of the author is< not to tear down, but rather to build 
up; had there been no "falling away," the claim of the prophet of the New 
Dispensation would have been an imposture; if there was a "falling away," 
however, his claim is credible. It was to establish this fact sharply and 
conclusively that these radio addresses were given. All who heard Elder 
Roberts or who will read these published discourses, will agree that be has 
accomplished the end in a scholarly and convincing manner. 

Though most of the discourses deal with eras of apostasy and centuries 
of discord, the ultimate message of the book is one of hope and salvation 
for the world. The three discourses on the Restoration read like the happy 
outcome of an otherwise tragic story. You feel at the end that the author 
has performed a necessary but melancholy task, only that he might invest 
with true meaning the unique claim of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints. 

The Appendix of the new work is an answer to Catholic charges that

A THRILLING STORY 

of Century One of 

CHURCH HISTORY 

ERE is a new story of "Mormonism," told with a com- 
pleteness and charm that will thrill Latter-day Saints 
with a pride of achievement and at the same time 
win the admiration of the critic, be he friend or foe. In a 
COMPREHENSIVE HISTORY OF THE CHURCH, B. H. 
Roberts has done a masterful piece of research and has set 
down the record of Century One — 1830 to 1930 — in a bril- 
liant appraisal of momentous events. The reader with a 
sentimental interest will be fascinated with this narrative 
of truth stranger than fiction; the reader who approaches 
the new work with the critical vision of the historian will 
find it fair in statement, authentic in fact, copious in detail 
and sound in judgment. 

A COMPREHENSIVE HISTORY OF THE CHURCH was 
written by Elder Roberts at the instance of the First Presi- 
dency of the Church, with a commission to make it exhaus- 
tively complete, from the remotest beginnings to the close 
of the Centennial Conference of April 6, 1930. The final 
volume ends with an account of the Conference itself, mak- 
ing the history technically inclusive of all that happened in 
Century One of the organized existence of the Church. Thus 
it is a fitting commemoration of one hundred years of strug- 
gle and achievement. 

This monumental work is not to be confused with any former 
history, journal or chronicle. Though its nucleus is the his- 
tory of "Mormonism" published a few years ago in 
AMERICANA, running serially for six years through that 
magazine, yet this History is NEW— new in its wealth of 
material, new in method of treatment and new in its physical 
representation of the book maker's art.

FIRST DAY 

MORNING MEETING 

When the time for commencing the Conference arrived the large 
auditorium and galleries; of the great Tabernacle were filled with people 
from the various stakes and missions of the Church. 

The first session commenced promptly at 10 o'clock, Friday morn- 
ing, October 5, when President Grant, who presided, announced that 
the congregation would sing the hymn, "Come, let us anew." 

After the singing of this hymn the opening prayer was offered 
by Elder George H. Robinson, President of the Bear Lake Stake. 

A soprano solo, "The mighty God hath spoken," was sung by Sister 
Laurinda P. Brewerton. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

Again I express my great pleasure in being present at another 
general conference. I hope that the prayer which has been offered may 
be answered, that we may have a time of rejoicing, that we may be 
encouraged and blessed and strengthened in the faith of the Gospel of 
our Savior, and that the inspiration of the Lord may be given to those 
who shall address us. 

PAYS TRIBUTE TO DEPARTED LEADERS 

I shall make a few remarks this morning with reference to Brother 
Anthony W. Ivins and Brother Charles H. Hart, and also pay a tribute 
of respect to Brother Franklin S. Richards. 

One of the greatest, most devoted and splendid members of the 
General Authorities of the Church has been taken from us at the ripe 
age of eighty-two. From his childhood until his death he has been a 
very studious man, gathering information on many subjects, and he 
was successful in all the walks of life in which he engaged. He was 
successful in more things than any other man I ever knew, and all his 
life fulfilled the requirements made in the Doctrine and Covenants, Sec- 
tion 88, verses 124, 125, 126 : 

Cease to be idle; cease to be unclean; cease to find fault one with another; 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 3 

cease to sleep longer than is needful ; retire to thy bed early, that ye may not be 
weary ; arise early, that your bodies and your minds may be invigorated ; 

And above all things, clothe yourselves with the bonds of charity, as with a 
mantle, which is the bond of perfectness and peace ; 

Pray always, that ye may not faint until I come; behold, and lo, I will come 
quickly, and receive you unto myself. 

Each and every requirement therein made Brother Ivins fulfilled, 
except the one "retire to thy bed early." I believe that he would have 
lived longer had he fulfilled that requirement, but he generally studied 
until midnight. Seldom did a day pass that he did not consult the dic- 
tionary. He fulfilled to the very letter the commandment — "Honor thy 
father and thy mother, that thy days may be long upon the land which the 
Lord thy God giveth thee." 

BORN OF GOODLY PARENTS 

Like Nephi of old, he was born of goodly parents. I know of no 
man of all my acquaintance who was a greater reader than his father. 
He read "The Native Races of the Pacific Coast," by Bancroft, as most 
of us would read a continued story in the newspaper. It was simply 
wonderful the fund of information that Israel Ivins had. He was an 
outstanding man, one of the greatest students I ever knew. He was 
president of the branch of the Church in New Jersey, which Erastus 
Snow and the Prophet Joseph Smith visited as young missionaries, and 
when he decided to come to Utah with his brother, Anthony Ivins, almost 
the entire branch came with him. There has never been a branch there 
since. 

I was told by Joseph Benedict, of the famous firm of Benedict 
Brothers, that Israel Ivins was the best read man on the subject of medi- 
cine that he had ever met; that he had studied and read more than a 
graduate physician. He was a man of great character and of great love. 
He was known as "Dr. Ivins" in southern Utah. In that hard country, 
where there was very little money, he gave his services mostly without 
money and without price. 

SERENE WOMEN 

Of all the women I have ever known in my life — though it might 
be said I am not a fair judge — the two most serene and splendid women 
were my own mother and her sister, the mother of Anthony W. Ivins. 
His mother was a student also, and so from childhood he had the advice 
and counsel of two very wonderful, studious parents. He honored them ; 
he respected them ; he listened to their advice in childhood and in young 
manhood ; and to those parents is due a great deal of credit for the suc- 
cess of his life. If all children would listen to good parents, as this 
man did, there would be few mistakes made in the battle of life. 

I, too, had the great blessing to be born of goodly parents. I remem- 
ber reading a trbiute to people who possess the characteristic of serenity, 
and I remember that when reading that tribute I wrote on the margin

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



of the book, "The two most serene women I have ever known are my 
own mother and her sister, Anna Ivins." 

LETTER OF SYMPATHY 

When my mother died the general manager for the United Kingdom 
of the great New York Life Insurance Company wrote me a letter of 
sympathy, and in it he referred to my mother as "dear Aunt Rachel." 
She kept boarders for a living, and the boarders called her "Aunt 
Rachel." Tony Ivins' sister waited on the table without pay and called 
mother "Aunt Rachel," so the boarders adopted that title. This man 
was agnostic believing only in the God of nature. He said: "If the 
God of nature ever did stamp peace, nobility and serenity upon any human 
countenance, he did upon the face of dear Aunt Rachel." And that same 
stamp was on the face of dear Aunt Anna. 

HIS FATHER 

I know nothing of course of the advice and counsel of a father be- 
cause mine died when I was a baby, but I have learned, of his reputation 
from others. People assure me that Jedediah M. Grant was one of the 
noblemen of this Church. > 

I remember at one time asking Captain William H. Hooper to sign 
some bonds for me, when I was a youngster of twenty just starting in 
business. 

He said : "I never do such a thing ; never do such a thing." 
I had no more than returned to my office when a young messenger 
came from the bank and told me the captain wanted to see me. 
I said : "I don't want to see him." 
"Well, he sent me to bring you to the bank." 

I went back, and he said: "Boy, boy, give me those bonds." I did 
so, and he signed them. Then he said : "When you went out I turned 
to Mr. Hills and said, 'Lew, who is that boy? He has been bowing to 
me on the street for years. I don't know who he is. I never sign a 
bond for somebody I don't know. Who is he?' He said 'Why that is 
Jeddy Grant's boy, Heber J. Grant'. 'Jeddy Grant's boy? Bring him back. 
I would sign that bond if I knew I had to pay it.' " 

A MARVELOUS HERITAGE 

I am mentioning these things in the hope that parents will realize 
that the example of integrity, of devotion, of loyalty to the Gospel, and 
the disposition not to find fault, but to labor diligently and unceasingly 
for the advancement of truth, is a marvelous heritage to leave to their 
children. Anthony W. Ivins and myself have that heritage. 

a millionaire's tribute 

I know of no more charitable man than Anthony W. Ivins. He 
had charity even for the erring and for the wicked. He reformed many 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT

a vicious man by his love and charity. I remember meeting on the 
streets of Salt Lake City a man named David Wood, of the Wood-Hagen- 
barth Livestock Company, the morning after Anthony W. Ivins was 
made an apostle. 
He said : 

Hold on, Grant, don't walk so fast. I want to tell you something. I am 
mighty glad you are running your "Mormon" Church just to suit me. If you 
had come to my office yesterday and said, "Dave Wood, you know the 'Mormon' 
people, and their leading men from Canada to Mexico. You have been a friend of 
ours for 25 long years. You have never indulged in any lying against the 
'Mormons.' You have never joined any anti-'Mormon' party. You have always 
spoken well of the 'Mormon' people at home and abroad, in the United States, 
and even in Europe, and I have been sent down to your office to tell you that we 
appreciate that and that we are going to permit you to name the man whom you 
consider to be the very finest and best man in all the Church to fill the vacancy 
in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles." Why, do you know, I would not have 
batted an eye or taken a breath. I would just have hollered "Ivins." I amf 
glad you are running your Church to suit me. Good-bye. 

It is no small thing to receive compliments of this kind. There is 
nothing that so completely rebukes the falsehoods against our people 
as the fact that in the judgment of a millionaire who had lived with us 
for 25 years we had chosen the best man in all the Church to be one of 
the apostles. 

PERSONALLY ACQUAINTED WITH GENERAL AUTHORITIES 

It fell to my lot as a child only five years of age to become acquainted 
with Brigham Young, and I came to know him as a God-fearing, honest, 
upright man, and that the one supreme thought of his heart and his soul 
was the advancement of his people. It fell to my lot as a member of the 
General Authorities of this Church to be associated with John Taylor, 
Wilford Woodruff, Lorenzo Snow, and Joseph F. Smith. I know as I 
know that I live that all the slanders that have ever been published 
against these men are falsehoods. They were honest, upright, God-fear- 
ing men, living in communion with God our Father. 

The very life of Anthony W. Ivins is a testimony of the work in 
which you and I are engaged. Men of his caliber, of his honesty, of 
his charity, of his love for his fellow men, men in communion with 
God, would not stay in this Church unless they had an abiding faith in 
the divinity of this work. 

AN EXAMPLE OF HONESTY 

I prize very highly a letter I received from a non-member of the 
Church, the general manager of one of the greatest insurance companies, 
congratulating me on having been made an apostle. He said : "I have 
known you from childhood. I know you are fundamentally honest 
from the crown of your head to the soles of your feet. I never had a 
very good opinion of the leaders of the Church. I had read so much 
against the Church." Of course there have been about 2,000 books pub-

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



lished against us. But there is an old saying that a lie can travel clear 
around the world while truth is getting out of bed and putting on its 
boots, but sooner or later the boots arrive, overtake the lie, and step on 
it. This man said : "Heber, though I have had a poor opinion of the 
leaders of the Church, now that you are one of them I apologize to the 
other 14. I know that they would not dare invite you into their councils 
unless they were honest. You would give the whole thing away if there 
were anything crooked." 

REJOICES IN TRIBUTES TO PRESIDENT IVINS 

I rejoice in the wonderful testimony to all the world in the life of 
Anthony W. Ivins. My heart is full of gratitude and thanksgiving for 
the wonderful tributes paid to him by the people in the Church and out 
of the Church. I think it is little less than wonderful to note the splen- 
did tributes that have been paid to him in newspapers that are owned 
by those not of our faith. I rejoice in the tribute paid by the bishop 
and other officials of the Catholic church, and the tolling of the Cathedral 
bells as the funeral cortege passed that great structure. I have never 
known such an outpouring of expressions of love and appreciation from 
all classes of people for anybody that has passed away, as have come re- 
garding Brother Ivins. 

EXPRESSES THANKS 

I rejoiced in the very wonderful editorial written by Noble Warrum 
years ago published in the Salt Lake Tribune when President Smith 
passed away. It was one of the most splendid tributes ever paid. I said 
to Mr. McKay, then manager and dictator of the editorial policy of the 
Tribune : "I accept that as a complete apology for all the cartoons and 
the vicious things that were published in your paper, years ago, against 
Joseph F. Smith." I appreciate and thank Noble Warrum for the splen- 
did editorial written about Anthony W. Ivins. I am grateful beyond 
expression for all of these tributes that have been paid to him. I am 
thankful that the president of the United States saw fit to send a tele- 
gram of congratulation on his birthday. 

I could go on talking for hours regarding Anthony Ivins, but I 
think perhaps I have said enough. I wish to say however, that in every 
particular he fulfilled the advice of the mother to her son: 

TO MY SON 

Do you know that your soul is of my soul such a part 
That you seem to be fiber and core of my heart? 
None other can pain me as you, dear, can do ; 
None other can please me, or praise me as you. 

Remember the world will be quick with its blame, 
If shadow or stain ever darken your name. 
"Like mother, like son," is a saying so true 
The world will judge largely of mother by you. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT

Be this, then, your task, if task it should be, 
To force the proud world to do homage to me. 
Be sure it will say, when its verdict you've won, 
"She reaped as she sowed. Lo, this is her son." 

I paid a brief tribute to Brother Hart yesterday, and I wished to 
offer that tribute here. I intended to bring the report of that five-minute 
sermon with me, because I want it recorded in the Conference Pamphlet, 
but I forgot it. One of the truest, noblest, most splendid men that I 
have been associated with, as one of the General Authorities of the 
Church, was Charles H. Hart. You will hear my tribute later, so I will 
say nothing further about him now. 

PRESIDENT IVINS LOVED BY YOUTH 

One of the things to which I wish to call attention with apprecia- 
tion is the wonderful respect shown in the attendance of young people 
of the Church at the funeral of Brother Ivins. If there was one man 
more than another of the General Authorities whom the young people 
admired and who they felt was their true friend, who had a sympathy 
for them and was always charitable toward the mistakes that they made, 
that man was Brother Ivins. This was appreciated, as shown by the 
splendid turnout of young people in his honor at his funeral. 

TRIBUTE TO BROTHER RICHARDS 

It fell to my lot to be associated for many years, during the presi- 
dency of John Taylor and Wilford Woodruff and Lorenzo Snow, with 
Brother Franklin D. Richards. A more gentle, kind, considerate, thought- 
ful man than Franklin D. Richards, I never knew. I remember one day 
getting quite angry at something, and talking pretty loud to Brother 
Richards, and he paid no attention to what I said. I went away and 
came back and apologized to him. He laughed and said : "I knew you 
didn't mean it. It did not affect me at all." 

Franklin S. Richards, like Brother Ivins, was the son of a most 
splendid father, a man of integrity and devotion to the work of God. I 
have known Franklin S. Richards very intimately, from the time I was a 
boy of twenty-two, having become a partner with his brother, Lorenzo 
L. Richards, in the insurance business in Ogden, under the firm name of 
Grant and Richards. I also became his partner under the firm name of 
Richards and Grant, owning a vinegar factory in Ogden. He subse- 
quently engaged in the wholesale dry-goods business, and I bought his 
interests in those two firms. I never met a brighter, more remarkable 
man, in my judgment, than Lorenzo L. Richards. Many is the night I 
have slept in Franklin D. Richards' home, and I became intimately 
acquainted, of course, with the father and the sons and the daughter. 

Franklin S. Richards was all that a father could ask of a son. No 
truer man, no more faithful man, no more humble man and no more 
intelligent man have I ever known. He was a splendid lawyer. During 
all of the dark days of trouble when we were disfranchised he was the 



8 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



"wheel-horse," figuratively speaking, in trying to change the condition 
of affairs in Washington, and he labored unceasingly to the day of his 
death. He had the unlimited confidence, I am sure, of each and every 
one of the members of the High Priests' quorum of Ensign stake over 
which he had the honor to preside at the time of his death. I loved him 
truly. It was a source of regret to me that I had to be absent from the 
city at the time of his funeral. 

GRATEFUL TO PRESS 

I do not feel impressed to say any more this morning, further than 
to extend to the members of the press — The Deseret News, the Telegram 
and the Tribune — my heartfelt thanks for the most splendid and won- 
derful notices and articles that were written regarding Brother Ivins ; and 
when I express this thought I know that I am also expressing the thought 
of gratitude that is in the heart of dear Sister Ivins and her children. 
May God bless and comfort them. May he lead us all to follow the 
example of our beloved fellow member of the Church, Brother Anthony 
W. Ivins, is my humble prayer, and I ask it in the name of Jesus, our 
Redeemer. Amen. 

The congregation arose and sang the hymn, "We thank thee, O God, 
for a prophet." 

ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

I have listened with much interest and appreciation to the remarks 
made by President Grant. I have felt the spirit that came from him to us 
— a spirit of love, admiration and appreciation for our brethren who have 
been called home and for all faithful Latter-day Saints who have fought 
life's battle wisely and well. It was my privilege to know, with some 
intimacy, the three brethren to whom President Grant has referred. They 
were men of God, wise men, kind men, generous men, for whom there 
grew up in my heart a deep and abiding love. I wish to add, without 
multiplying words on this occasion, my own appreciation, my own high 
estimate of these brethren whom we have lost during the last few weeks 
as they have gone to their eternal home. 

NO DEVIATION FROM FUNDAMENTAL TRUTH 

While President Grant was speaking, the question ran through 
my mind, more than any other : Just what made these men great ? What 
made them worthy of the great praise given to them by the President 
of the Church? The thought came in answer that ever since the days 
of the Prophet Joseph Smith, to the present prophet, Heber J. Grant, 
the men who have stood at the head of this Church have taught the 
same doctrine, have left behind the same message. There has been a 



ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 



9 



certainty of declaration on their part. There has been no deviation from 
fundamental principles. Undoubtedly the reason why these brethren, 
who have been held before us as examples today, were great, is because 
they also clung to the fundamental principles of truth which make up the 
foundation and the frame work of the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. 

For a number of years I was engaged in reading the sermons of 
Brigham Young, having in mind a compilation of his wise sayings for 
the benefit of the Saints. I was amazed to note how closely, how care- 
fully, he followed the doctrine laid down by the Prophet Joseph Smith 
who himself only taught the pure, unchanged Gospel of the Lord Jesus 
Christ. As I read on, studying the teachings of those who came after 
Brigham Young, I found the same thing to be true. I have listened in 
this tabernacle, for many years, to the words of President Heber J. 
Grant, and I have found him likewise a teacher of the same doctrine 
that was taught by Joseph Smith, by Brigham Young, and by the others 
who have preceded President Grant in his high office. There has been 
no deviation in his teachings from fundamental truth ; not by a hair's 
breadth. 

In this changelessness of fundamental teaching, lies not only a testi- 
mony of the truth of this great work but also a principle of comfort to all 
who belong to the Church. I belong to various scientific societies. In 
them I find that theories come and go. We all belong to various organ- 
izations, political parties, and we observe that from day to day the prin- 
ciples that guide the membership of these associations seem to vary, to 
change. I can cling safely to the Church, to the Gospel of Jesus Christ ; 
it has steadying power, it does not change nor vary. It is the same today, 
yesterday and forever. 

THE STORY OF MAN'S HISTORICAL DIFFICULTY AND SUCCESS 

I am wondering if in this principle does not lie the real story of 
man's historical difficulty and success. The history of the world indicates 
that any nation, country, or group of people which has set up a righteous 
principle and has lived by it and died by it, has risen to greatness, both 
before their own generation and those that came after. Perhaps the 
greatness of the British people, admired over the world, is due in great 
measure to the fact that for three-quarters of a millennium they have 
clung to a doctrine of human liberty expressed in the famous document 
known as Magna Charta. Perhaps the greatness of the United States 
of America is due, in largest measure, to the clinging to the simple prin- 
ciple that every man is entitled to life, liberty and the pursuit of happi- 
ness. It is by the adherence to such fundamental principles that men 
and families, peoples and nations, grow great and persist among the 
generations of men. 

THE CHURCH NOT STATIC 

■ Do not misunderstand me as I speak on this theme. Every man 
clothes his ideas in his own words. Joseph Smith did not speak as Heber 



10 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



J. Grant speaks. The principles, the ideas were the same, but the words 
used, the forms of expression, belong to the speaker; and every man 
has a right to express as best he can in the words God gives him, the eter- 
nal truths that he may obtain from a divine source. 

Again, do not misunderstand me. I do not mean that this church and 
kingdom is static, that we stand still. I believe in a living, growing 
Church, which is in need of and does receive revelation from day to day. 
Nothing is more certain to me than that we were founded in revelation 
from God, and that we are guided daily by such revelation. We shall 
have revelation for our guidance to the end of time ; but such new rev- 
elations as may come will never supersede, destroy or abrogate the fun- 
damental principles upon which this Church rests its body of doctrine. 
A new revelation merely adds and develops and more nearly completes 
that which has formerly been given. 

APPLICATION OF ETERNAL PRINCIPLES TO PRESENT NEEDS 

The conditions of our people, the Latter-day Saints, in the days of 
Ohio, Missouri and Illinois, were as different from the conditions of to- 
day, almost as night is from day. Our people then lived under pioneer 
conditions, with no knowledge of the things which have given us the 
most remarkable mechanical civilization of all earthly time. We cannot 
expect that the exact application of the eternal principles of the Gospel 
should be the same today as in the days of Ohio or Missouri, but we do 
expect that any new revelation will be very largely the application of 
the eternal principles of truth to present needs. I rejoice that as far as I 
have been able to read the history of this Church and as far as I have 
lived life in the Church I have seen from day to day such application of 
fundamental eternal unchanging laws of the Gospel to the needs of the 
changing, existing today. 

GUIDED BY SPIRIT OF REVELATION 

I speak from a firm conviction, having tried the Gospel. When I 
say that this Church is guided and led today as yesterday by the spirit of 
revelation issuing from God to and through his servants who are called 
from time to time to guide, on earth, the destinies of the Church, I am 
certain that President Ivins possessed the spirit of revelation and was 
guided by it. President Hart, Elder Richards and all other faithful 
people who have lived the Gospel and gone to their honorable reward, 
have lived righteously because they in their respective spheres were under 
the guidance of the spirit of revelation. Every person is entitled to com- 
munion with God and guidance from him in all that has to be done from 
day to day. All officers of the Church, in the Priesthood, or the auxiliary 
organizations in their official labors, have the right to enjoy that spirit 
of guidance which we call the spirit of inspiration or revelation. The 
man who stands at the head of the Church receives such guidance for all 
of us. He is indeed a revelator for the Church. Our safety li-s in 
listening to that which he says, in being guided by what he counsels. We 



ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 



11 



are as nothing, in this Church and kingdom, if we are not founded upon 
revelation and guided by continuous revelation. The urgent need of the 
world is the wisdom that comes by revelation from the Lord. There will 
be no peace on earth, no final solution of man's vexing problems, until 
leaders and followers humble themselves to receive guidance from the 
heavens. 

MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING AND COMPREHENSION 

In concluding this thought let me say that not only must the speak- 
er, standing in this or any other pulpit, be guided by the spirit of 
revelation in what he says — if he is to serve well the cause that he rep- 
resents — but those who listen must also be directed by the spirit of rev- 
elation. The speaker and the hearer together must be guided by the 
voice that comes from God's presence. Then there is mutual under- 
standing and comprehension. That principle was beautifully told to 
the Prophet Joseph Smith at the very beginning of the Church. The 
doctrine is set forth in section 50, of the book of Doctrine and Cove- 
nants, in which it is explained that when both the hearer and the speaker 
are moved upon by the same power and spirit the greatest joy is attained. I 
may be permitted to read at least two verses of that glorious revelation 
which should be known by all Latter-day Saints : 

Wherefore, he that preacheth and he that receiveth, understandeth one another, 
and both are edified and rejoice together; 

And that which doth not edify is not of God, and is darkness. 

THE SPIRIT OF LIGHT AND TRUTH 

Then follows what is to me perhaps the most beautiful saying among 
the many beautiful sayings in the revelations of God in these latter days : 

That which is of God is light ; and he that receiveth light and continueth in 
God, receiveth more light, and that light groweth brighter and brighter until the 
perfect day. 

The day for which we hope, the day towards which we move even 
in this life. 

When apostasy comes, it is because the spirit of revelation departs 
from us. The wire is broken between us and the source of truth. We 
cannot understand, though truth be spoken, since we are not possessed 
of the spirit of truth. We misunderstand and misinterpret. 

There is only one way, brethren and sisters, to obtain and possess 
this mighty spirit which led Joseph Smith into the grove, there to receive 
the first vision, which made him the head of the last dispensation, which 
guides the Church today and enlightens every soul, and that is by obey- 
ing strictly, with all our might, as far as we poor mortal beings are able, 
the laws of the Gospel. If we obey, if we practice in our lives the truths 
given us, then as certainly as we do that, the enlivening spirit of light, of 
revelation, of understanding will come to us, comprehension will enter our 
minds and hearts and we shall know the true joy of being Latter-day 
Saints.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



BEARS TESTIMONY 

I bear witness to you, my brethren and sisters, that President Heber 
J. Grant is called and inspired of God and that he speaks the words of 
God. I bear witness that revelation continues in this Church, that, the 
door of divine communication is as open today as it was in the days of 
Joseph Smith. The great men mentioned here today so lived the Gos- 
pel that they will reap the rich reward of faithful living, and also have 
become examples fit to hold up in a. general conference for us all to fol- 
low. They walked in the light of revelation. 

May God grant us power to understand the principles of the Gospel 
and power to live them, so that we may win for ourselves the abiding 
great joy that all faithful Latter-day Saints have the right to claim, 
I pray, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

As an officer of the Mutual Improvement Association of the 
Church, I desire to speak briefly in this conference of some of the 
ideals we are striving for in this great young peoples' organization. 
This M. I. A. structure of activity, this Mutual Improvement pro- 
gram that means actions noble and high and exalted on the part 
of your young folks, speaks louder than can words that we are 
giving genuine allegiance to the Church. 

M. I. A. SLOGAN 

Our slogan for the present season is : "By my actions I will 
prove my allegiance to the Church." Our young people are re- 
peating it everywhere. Perhaps most of you who are in attendance 
at this General Conference have also repeated it. Judging from 
the spirit of the Mutual conventions which, during the last three 
months, have been held in nearly all of our stakes, our young 
folks, our young men and young women, have been found putting 
forth an effective and commendable effort, they have been strug- 
gling earnestly, and it seems successfully, to live in accordance with 
this practical teaching, this intensely practical doctrine of letting 
their conduct tell of their interest in and their devotion to the 
Church. Their attitude is giving us cheer and encouragement. 

MISUNDERSTANDINGS BETWEEN YOUTH AND MATURITY 

There have always been misunderstandings more or less ser- 
ious between the younger and the older folks and probably this 
condition will always prevail. Maturity always fears for the moral- 
ity, for the faith and for the safety of those who are young; while 
on the other hand, those who are young feel keenly that they are 
not understood by those who are older. In the past, however, youth 
seems always to have gotten along fairly well in some way or 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 



13 



other. Remember we who are the grown-ups of today, we who 
have the gray heads now were the youth of yesterday. 

M. I. A. MANUALS AND BOOKS 

As an evidence of our sincerity in adopting this year's slogan, 
I refer you to our M. I. A. manuals and the books on our reading 
course. I need not name them. They are available to you since 
they are being studied in all your wards. Concerning one of these, 
the manual for the M Men department, written by Dr. Lowell L. 
Bennion and entitled "What About Religion," I understood Presi- 
dent Grant to say that this little volume pleased him greatly, so 
much so in fact that he regards it as one of the best pieces of 
literature the Church has produced. 

But it is not of this but of our Adult Manual that I desire on 
this occasion to say a few words. This publication has been pre- 
pared by our able writer and scholar, John Henry Evans, and its 
title is "The Leadership of Joseph Smith." Realizing that members 
of the Church cannot learn too much of this strong, outstanding, 
divinely guided leader, we have had this manual prepared confident 
that as you read and study it you will find new joy and faith and 
testimony. The more we learn of Joseph Smith the Prophet, the 
greater and grander and nobler as an inspired leader and prophet 
will we discover him to be and the more we will desire to follow 
his inspired leadership. 

A SUBJECT ON WHICH ALL CAN AGREE 

The divinity of the teachings, the revelations and the messages 
ofl the Prophet is one subject on which all genuine Latter-day 
Saints, young as well as old, can and must agree. We have in him 
a man genuinely great. He was made so, we verily believe, by the 
power of God. I have been looking all my days for some one, 
philosopher, statesman or scholar, who could account for the numer- 
ous outstanding accomplishments of Joseph Smith in any way 
other than that he was guided by divine power. Thus far I have 
found no one, scholar, philosopher or other wise man, who could 
account for him and his accomplishments in any other way. 

THE PERSONALITY OF JOSEPH SMITH 

In this outstanding personage, the Prophet Joseph Smith, no 
one was ever disappointed. The fondest anticipations of those who 
had heard of him as a new and modern and marvelous prophet 
were mild indeed compared with the actual impressions that his 
presence, his personality and his individual contact produced. Dr. 
Andrew D. White, outstanding teacher, president of Cornell Uni- 
versity, scholar, diplomat and statesman, told me with his own 
lips that while he had seen the Prophet in Nauvoo for but a 
moment he regarded him as not only a strong personality but as 
a most unusual and magnetic one. 



14 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Joseph Smith aroused the keenest interest in every' one who 
met him. From those who are not members of our own Church, 
he invariably commanded respect and admiration. From his fellow 
churchmen he drew forth an undying 1 love that we might call 
almost adoration. Our outstanding leaders who traveled far to 
see the Prophet soon found themselves tied to him with that affec- 
tion which nothing else can produce but the power of Almighty 
God. Parley P. Pratt came to him from Ohio, Orson Pratt from 
New York, Sidney Rigdon and Edward Partridge from Ohio, John 
Taylor from Canada, Brigham Young from Vermont, Willard Rich- 
ards and Orson Spencer from Massachusetts, Charles C. Rich from 
Ilinois, etc. Many other outstanding scholars, pioneers and great 
men of the Church came from all parts of the nation and not one 
was disappointed in the character, the personality and the leader- 
ship of Joseph Smith. All were glad of an opportunity to follow 
his inspired leadership and considered so doing an outstanding 
privilege. Strangers who came to see him, even from foreign coun- 
tries, invariably looked upon him with admiration. 

TRIBUTES BY CONTEMPORARIES 

"Although in him there was nothing strange or different from other men 
in his personal appearance," said Amasa M. Lyman who came from Massachu- 
setts, "yet when he grasped my hand in that cordial way known to those who 
had met him in the honest simplicity of truth, I felt as one of old in the 
presence of the Lord. My strength seemed to be gone, so that it required 
an effort on my part to stand on my feet. 

But in all this," says he, "there was no fear. The serenity and peace of 
heaven pervaded my soul, and the still, small voice of the Spirit whispered 
its living testimony into the depths of my being that he was a man of God." 
(Joseph Smith the American Prophet, Evans, p. 5.) 

Josiah Quincy has said that it is by no means improbable that 
some future text book will state that the historical American of 
the nineteenth century that has exerted the most powerful in- 
fluence upon the destinies of his country is Joseph Smith the 
Mormon prophet. "Born in the lowest ranks of poverty," continues 
Quincy, "he had, without book learning, made himself at the age 
of 39 a power upon the earth. If the reader does not know what to 
make of Joseph Smith, I cannot help him out of the difficulty since 
I myself stand helpless before the puzzle." (Joseph Smith the 
American Prophet, pp. 4 and 13.) 

A GREAT LEADER AND PROPHET 

It is certain, says John Henry Evans (p. vii) that "no more 
spectacular or strange or dynamic or fascinating personality can 
be found in modern history." Evans further writes : 

Here is a man who was born in the stark hills of Vermont; who was 
reared in the backwoods of New York; who never looked inside a college or 
a high school; who lived in six states, no one of which would own him dur- 
ing his lifetime; who spent months in the vile prisons of the period; who 
even when he had his freedom, was hounded like a fugitive; who was covered 
once with a coat of tar and feathers, and left for dead; who, with his follow- 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 



15 



ing, was driven by irate neighbors from New York to Ohio, from Ohio to 
Missouri, and from Missouri to Illinois; and who, at the unripe age of 
thirty-nine was shot to death by a mob with painted faces. 

Yet this man became the mayor of the biggest town in Illinois and the 
state's most prominent citizen, the commander of the largest body of trained 
soldiers in the nation outside of the Federal army, the founder of cities and 
of a university, and aspired to become President of the United States. 

* * * On the threshold of an organizing age he established the most 
nearly perfect social mechanism in the modern world, and developed a 
religious philosophy that challenges anything of the kind in history, for 
completeness and cohesion. And he set up the machinery for an economic 
system that would take the brood of Fears out of the heart of man — that is, 
the fear of want through sickness, old age, unemployment and poverty. In 
thirty nations are men and women who look upon him as a greater leader 
than Moses and a greater prophet than Isaiah. (See introductory page of 
Evans' book.) 

Is it any wonder that we recommend, in fact that we urge not 
only the youth but all other members of the Church to make a 
more careful study of the outstanding accomplishments, teachings, 
life and doctrines of this great leader and prophet under whose in- 
spired leadership the Church of Jesus Christ has been restored and 
reestablished ? 

Perhaps by reading and studying his life we ourselves may be 
able to acquire in some small degree some of his marvelous traits 
of character. It is certainly our duty as members of the Church of 
Jesus Christ — believers in the Gospel plan restored and established 
by the power of God through this Prophet, to know more of this 
great character. 

SAMPLES OF INSPIRATION 

Listen to a few sentences from some of the revelations which 
have come to us through this modern Prophet : 

Hearken, O ye people of my church, saith the voice of him who dwells 
on high, and whose eyes are upon all men; yea, verily I say: Hearken ye 
people from afar; and ye that are upon the islands of the sea listen together. 

For verily the voice of the Lord is unto all men, and there is none to 
escape; and there is no eye that shall not see; neither ear that shall not hear, 
neither heart that shall not be penetrated. (Doc. & Cov. 1:1-2.) 

And further : 

I the Lord cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance. 
(Doc. & Cov. 1:31.) 

These are but samples of the language and the inspiration 
contained in some of the words given to us by the Prophet, our 
Prophet, the Prophet of the Lord, the Prophet of these last days. 

Behold, verily, thus saith the Lord unto you: In consequence of evils 
and designs which do and will exist in the hearts of conspiring men in the 
last days, I have warned you and forewarn you, by giving unto you this word 
of wisdom by revelation. (Doc. & Cov. 89:4.) 

NOT GOOD FOR MAN 

This Word of Wisdom informs us that tea and coffee and 
tobacco and strong drinks are not good for man. 



16 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



While it is true that on the 7th day of November in the year 
of our Lord 1933, the people of the United States by their votes 
repealed Prohibition, while they repealed the Eighteenth Amend- 
ment, the people did not then nor will they ever repeal that law 
of nature which says that alcohol is a poison. The people did not 
then nor will they ever repeal the Word of Wisdom which says 
strong drinks are not good for man. 

Actions not only speak louder, but they speak much louder 
than do words. He who belongs to the L. D. S. group and drinks 
tea or drinks coffee or uses tobacco in any form or fails to resist 
the temptation to drink his glass of beer or any other beverage 
containing alcohol surely cannot regard himself as being true to 
his own group. Certainly he is not by his actions proving his al- 
legiance to the Church. 

What actions of mine are referred to in this slogan? As I re- 
peat it do I give proper consideration to Church standards and do 
I analyze my conduct with regard to these standards? 

HONESTY AND FAIR DEALING 

First, we believe in being honest. Do we have this in mind 
when we say that by our actions we will prove our allegiance to 
the Church? If we live up to the ideal expressed in this slogan, 
then in our dealings we are to be fair. When we speak we are to 
tell the truth. If by our actions we are to show ourselves to be 
honest, we will not create a false impression by telling only half 
of the truth. In short, our dealings with our fellowmen will be 
so fair and so frank, so honest that we shall have nothing to con- 
ceal. By thus living and thus acting we shall so teach the Gospel 
that by our actions, which speak louder than any words, we shall 
teach our neighbors and our business associates that we* not only 
believe the Gospel as it has been revealed through Joseph Smith 
the Prophet, but we in our very lives are practicing it. We shall 
then be proving by our conduct our allegiance to the Church and 
our faith in the divinity of the message brought to us through 
this outstanding and marvelous modern man, the Prophet Joseph 
Smith. 

IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIGH IDEALS 

Next, we believe in being true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous 
and in doing good to all men. In our dealings with our fellows day 
by day and all the time if we are true to the promise in this pledge, 
this slogan, then we must try unceasingly to live in accordance 
with all these high ideals. Thus we shall prove that we have faith 
in and that we are struggling to live in accordance with the high 
ideals, the standards of the Church of Jesus Christ. 

By being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous and in doing 
good to all men, by going forward literally by the tens of thou- 
sands and thus by our actions proving our allegiance to the Church, 
we are, as our new M. I. A. song by Miss Beesley says, "Building 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 



17 



today the house of youth. Its foundations are strong and secure. 
Faith in God and devotion to truth, honor that shall endure. Its 
walls are adorned with garlands bright," in which "virtue and love 
entwine ; and its structure shall rise till it reaches the skies, gleam- 
ing with light divine." 

It is not by our words only but by our actions, by living in 
accordance with the ideals expressed in this new and noble song 
that we are building a structure that will be great and glorious and 
beautiful. The structure will rise until it reaches the skies and it 
will be lighted with the light and power and inspiration of Almighty 
God. It will indeed "gleam with light divine." 

THE ROAD TO PERFECTION 

I am speaking now of the ideals of our institution, the ideals 
of the Church. As M. I. A. workers we may not be able always 
to live strictly in accordance with these, all cannot reach the top ; 
this would be impossible since our goal is perfection. With us who 
have weaknesses, with us who lack strength to resist temptation, 
I appeal to you to have patience and charity. We pledge ourselves 
that all the time and without ceasing we shall try to do and to be 
better. We have had come into our souls that light and inspira- 
tion which comes with the receiving of the Holy Ghost, we have 
tugging at our feet constantly that pull to do right, that pull whose 
aim is to bring us back into the straight way, that way which is 
narrow. We expect this pull to continue as long as in our souls 
there is that glow of joy and satisfaction that nothing else can 
give but a testimony and knowledge of the divinity of the mission 
of the Prophet. I mean that knowledge and testimony which noth- 
ing else can bring but righteous living and the power of God. 

ELDER SAMUEL O. BENNION 

Of The First Council of the Seventy 

I sincerely hope that I may be led to say this morning that which 
the Lord would have me say for the good of all who are here and for all 
who may listen. This, I think, is a great opportunity that the Lord has 
given his children, to gather together upon occasions of this kind, to give 
a reason for the hope that is within them, and to gain more evidence of 
him and his great plan. 

I am sure that this is the work of the Lord. There is not any ques- 
tion in my mind concerning the truth of his great revelation and his 
organization in these the last days. We are not so sure of the things of 
this world. The mediums of exchange that are used everywhere may 
change. They may lose their value entirely. Principles may prove to be 
valueless in the management of nations. But the plan of God, our 
Eternal Father, will not change. The great institution that he estab- 
lished through his Son, in the days of the Prophet, over a hundred years 
ago, will not change. 



18 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



It is the right and the privilege of all men to become acquainted 
with the plan of life and salvation, which provides for their welfare, not 
only here but in the world to come. There never was a greater oppor- 
tunity than now, I am sure, for the youth of Zion, and all the inhabitants 
of Zion, to become acquainted with this great work of our Redeemer. 

The law of baptism was instituted as the means by which men were 
to gain admission into the Church of God our Father in the earth. The 
mode is indicated by the word from which "baptism" is derived, and 
when this ordinance is administered in any other way we know it is in- 
correct. There, is no other way than by immersion for the remission of 
sins. We may be challenged on this point, but the language itself con- 
cerning the mode of baptism clearly defines the way by which men are 
to be brought into the Church, and no other way could be considered. 
So we. stand, as a church, absolutely sure of our ground. Men have 
changed the ordinance, but our Eternal Father's plan never changes. His 
language pointed out the mode in the beginning. It will be so in the 
end. 

Following baptism is the laying on of hands for the reception of 
the Holy Ghost. This is the birth of the Spirit which completely im- 
merses the souls of men and fills them with the inspiration and power 
of the Eternal Father, bears witness unto them that they have received 
the knowledge that he wished to convey, a knowledge of their Redeemer, 
a knowledge of his great plan for the redemption of his children. It is 
within the reach of the entire human family, if they will but read aright 
and pray unto God, their Father, for understanding. 

The youth of Zion should become acquainted with this ordinance of 
baptism. I am sure that we do not understand it as well as we ought to 
do. Hundreds of young men and young women have not learned, as they 
must learn, the reason why men and women are baptized, the mode of 
baptism, who are to administer it, and what it means to be a baptized 
member of the Church and to receive the inspiration and power of the 
Holy Ghost. 

The things of this earth will pass away as the frost before the sun. 
Men and women will come and go. Great institutions will be organ- 
ized and fail. But the plan of our Eternal Father will always live. It 
will be found in eternity as well as here. It is the thing by which men 
may measure themselves. It is the thing by which they may know where- 
of they speak. It is the thing that will keep them in the straight and 
the narrow way. 

There can be no question at all concerning this great Church. Men 
and women in the Church may fail, but the great Church is the one 
that our Eternal Father established in these the last days, by which men 
and women should return unto him. If men and women will but keep 
the commandments of God as well as they can they need have no fear. 
Life is but a short span. We are here but a few moments of time, 
compared with the great periods of time of our Eternal Father. It is 
your day and it is mine to live in the earth and to obtain a knowledge 
that will take us back into the presence of God, that will give us the power 



ELDER SAMUEL O. BEN N I ON

to overcome, to live down weaknesses that are natural to the flesh. It 
is the great school that our Eternal Father planned for us, and we of all 
people can be most sure of our position, and give unto God, our Eternal 
Father, the praise and the honor and the glory. We can afford to be 
charitable in every way. We can afford to be kind and to be diligent. 
We can extend, every courtesy to others who have not received the light 
that has come to us in this day. 

I have heard that the Gospel is termed "dry" by some people. But 
it is the most interesting thing in all the world. It has a foundation 
and assurance by which every man and woman may know their pos- 
sibilities, as the days come and go and as they advance. It is the great 
plan which our Eternal Father sent from heaven to us. We became 
acquainted with it long before the foundation of this earth was laid, and 
we now have the opportunity of taking part in it. This is a temporary 
world to which there will be an end; the bodies of men will grow cold 
and inactive ; life will depart. But while we are here, away from home 
as it were, our Eternal Father has given us the privilege of proving our- 
selves to him. We are here, to learn the truth, to speak it and to live it, 
and to overcome the power of the adversary, who is in the earth to thwart 
the purposes of God. He challenged God long before the foundations 
of this earth were laid. He went into battle against him, and he has 
renewed it here, every day and every hour while men live in the flesh. 
He will claim as many as he can, and the only weapon by which men 
may reach him and be able to withstand his attack is to learn the paths 
which our Eternal Father has laid out for us. He desires his sons and 
his daughters to know the Church and to enter into it ; and to know its 
principles ; to teach them to others. This is the great plan by which 
men and women may come unto him. 

Our Heavenly Father gave us our own free agency. He taught 
it to us, gave it to us when we walked by sight and not by faith. He 
planned for our redemption, but gave us the privilege to receive or re- 
ject. I am sure that if all men could know the plan of our Eternal 
Father, as he has outlined it in his revelations, they would be able to 
meet the advance of the adversary in every form, and be led to glorify 
God, for great is the work of God, and great are the purposes of our 
Redeemer ! 

This is the day for men to become men, and for women to become 
women. It is the day, as Alma the prophet, said, when men are to pre- 
pare to meet their God. While here in mortality we enter into business, 
into commercial relationships with men, but there is a right way to do it. 
God never i intended that it should be done in a dishonest way, any more 
than he intended that men should be untruthful. He planned the 
greatest scheme by which men should become strong, and by which they 
might come unto him as only real sons can come. He provided a great 
course of study for his sons and daughters in the earth. 

When men can see their way clear to enter into the Church, through 
the door of the sheep-fold, to obtain that witness that comes from him 
that this is his work, it is the happiest and most privileged new birth that 



20 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



they have ever received. There are millions of men in this world who 
need the support of this Church. They need the testimony of men who 
know the truth; they need the explanation of the principles of it. It 
isn't hard; it is easy to understand. The people of the world need it 
more today than they ever did before. The world is in trouble. Trouble is 
everywhere. It is in the family, it is in the nations. The voice of God 
is ready when they are ready to receive it, but they can only receive it when 
they hear it, and they cannot hear it except men be sent to provide for 
their hearing. In the fulness of time every son and daughter who may 
be entitled to the testimony of Jesus in the flesh shall hear it. 

As I see it this morning this is our mission : To provide for the 
welfare of the children of men, to sustain the holy Priesthood of God 
the Father in the earth, vested in his sons, to carry on the plan that he 
intended, to speak the truth and to live it, and to overcome. I think that 
men and women will never be perfect in the flesh. It is not a perfect 
world. But we can go on every day acquiring the power to perfect 
ourselves, and thus be better prepared when we leave here to enter into 
another great school of experience that shall be ours before the time 
comes for men to receive their bodies, resurrected and assigned to a 
glory. 

This is a great life, brethren and sisters and friends. It is a glori- 
ous opportunity to acquire knowledge. The knowledge of this Gospel 
is the most interesting thing in the world. The exchanges of this world 
and their values may pass away in a night and be of no more use to us, 
but the things that God revealed for the benefit of his children shall al- 
ways be useful, as long as the earth stands, and in the eternities to come, 
forever and forever. 

May we keep these things in our minds, and sustain the authority of 
the Church. I tell you those men who stood by the Prophet in the days 
of Nauvoo, and who stood by the Prophet Brigham Young, and who 
have stood by the leaders of this Church, from then until now — they and 
their seed are the ones upon whom the Lord counts. I find them in the 
stakes of Zion where I travel. I have been away from home a long time 
and have rtot had an opportunity to visit the stakes of Zion, but now, in 
these stakes and in these valleys, I find the descendants of these men 
standing valiantly for the great plan of our Eternal Father. I bear 
witness to you, that it is because of the faith and devotion of their 
fathers that was taught them and written in their hearts by those early 
leaders with whom they associated. I hope the men and women of Zion, 
the youth of Zion, will learn the principles of the Gospel, and will love 
them. That this may be our privilege, more now than ever before, I 
humbly pray, in Jesus' name. Amen. 

ELDER CHARLES E. ROWAN, JR. 

President of the Texas Mission 

My brethren and sisters, I feel it is a great privilege to be 
in attendance at this conference. I desire to add my testimony to 



ELDER CHARLES E. ROWAN, JR. 



21 



the tributes that have been paid here this morning with reference 
to the loss that we have sustained in this great church. 

I bring you greetings from the Texas Mission, and am de- 
lighted to say that your sons and daughters, in the main, are well 
and happy. I believe that without an exception they are enjoying 
the Spirit of the Lord, that they are enjoying their labors, and 
that they are anxious to put the message of Mormonism before the 
people in that part of the Lord's vineyard. I am grateful to my 
Heavenly Father for the opportunity of serving among those fine 
people. 

I am happy to say to you, this morning, that the mission, 
so far as I am able to interpret, is going forward. Saturday, as I 
left the office, the secretary of the Sunday Schools of the mission 
handed me his report, and he said all of the Sunday Schools have 
reported the Dime Fund except nine, and ten of them have reported 
more than one hundred per cent collection. I believe that condition 
is reflected in most all of the auxiliaries in the Texas Mission. 

These branches and these auxiliaries are officered by men and 
women who have embraced and accepted the Gospel in the mission 
field. I am happy, my brethren and sisters, I say, to be associated 
with those fine people. We have had some wonderful things hap- 
pen to us during this year. The Lord has been kind in opening up 
the way for our Elders to preach the Gospel. I am sure President 
Bennion will be happy when I tell him that in one of the southern 
cities in which, I believe, we have never been privileged before to 
preach the Gospel, this summer the Elders have been granted the 
opportunity of preaching on the streets, and they are meeting with 
a wonderful reception. As I passed through Dallas Sunday morn- 
ing I met one of the young men who was instrumental in the 
hands of the Lord in securing permission from the mayor and the 
chief of police to preach on the streets in that city, and he was 
telling me of the splendid reception they were having. In this 
city they have a higher school of learning which is operated by 
one of the great churches, and he told me that one of the leading 
professors in that institution had offered him a scholarship if he 
would come and attend that institution. A wonderful spirit is pre- 
vailing and many people are being led into the Church. We are 
grateful for these things. 

I rejoice in the testimony that the missionaries have. I re- 
joice in the power and manifestation of the Spirit of God that is 
present in that mission field. I have here a testimony that I would 
like to read that seems to me to be rather unusual. It is about 
a young man who lives in Evanston, Wyoming. He has been a 
student in the East. I think he spent four years studying to become 
a doctor. After that I understand that he specialized in abnormal 
psychology, and was employed in that profession at the time this 
accident occurred. I am going to just take the time to read the 
story as it was written to me by the sister of this good man.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



With a group of friends Carlton went to Galveston Bay to swim. There 
were many people there enjoying the swimming and diving. My brother became 
separated from his friends, but as he ran along the pier and was about to make 
a dive his feet slipped and he fell, striking the bottom of the Bay, breaking his 
neck (6th and 7th Cervical). Strange as it may seem, he was not knocked uncon- 
scious, and the first thought that came was that he was at the end of his life; 
no one had seen the accident. He was determined to hold his breath as long as 
possible, but just when he realized his end was near, and he had found it was 
impossible to move on account of being totally paralyzed from his neck down, he 
found that someone had found him and was bringing him to the surface of the 
water. Strange as it may seem, one of his companions stopped for a moment on 
the pier and amid those hundreds of people saw this man disappear, and found 
that he did not come to the surface. He dived in after Carlton, and when he brought 
him to the surface found it was his friend. He said: "Carlton, put your arm 
around me. I did not know that I was rescuing you." Carlton replied and said : 
"I can't move : I have broken my neck. Get me to the hospital as quickly as pos- 
sible." 

Arriving at the hospital the best doctors were called into consultation. They 
marveled, when they had Carlton on the operating table, that he helped to diagnose 
his own case. He asked their opinion about the possibility of his living. He was 
informed that it would be impossible for him to live three days. He smiled and 
said: "Well, I just can't die. Life is sweet. I must live for Mother." 

The next morning after the operation the doctors expected him to be uncon- 
scious, but when they opened the door of his room he greeted them and said : 
"Good morning, doctors. I have a hard fight before me, but I am going to win." 

Awaking from a short sleep he saw a minister standing over him and he said : 
"Young man, I have come to have you make peace with God before the end." 
Carlton asked him to please leave the room; that his church had always taught 
him to love God. 

For two weeks after his loved ones arrived from the West they tried to locate 
the Elders, and finally located President Rowan. President Rowan and Brother 
Baxter came to the hospital and administered to Carlton, and from that time on 
Carlton began to improve. So wonderful was his recovery that the doctors 
marveled. They were impressed with the fine young missionaries who came from 
time to time to visit. They were eager to know who the group of fine men were. 
Those doctors did not take credit unto themselves for this miraculous recovery, 
but said : "It is Carlton's faith in God that has accomplished this." Another 
one said : "Give all the credit to God. It is Carlton's fine clean living and his faith 
that has accomplished this." 

I talked with a lady, the sister of the president of that stake, yester- 
day, and she told me that he was continuing to improve. They removed 
him from the hospital in Houston, and he has been brought back to Wyo- 
ming, where he continues to improve. We feel that the Lord was unusu- 
ally kind to; him. 

During the summer we have had a little sickness among the 
Elders. One of them developed heart trouble, circulatory trouble 
of the heart. We took him to one of the best heart specialists in 
the South, and discovered, when we found this man, that he was a 
friend to the Church ; he was a friend to the members of the 
Church. He was born and raised in Canada, a highly educated man. 
He told me with his own lips that in 1907 he spent three months 
practicing in the state of Utah, in a little country town, and that 
his association with the Mormon people had been most pleasant. 
Said he to me: "Brother Rowan, I realize that there is power in 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints." 



ELDER CHARLES E. ROWAN, JR.

This doctor gave a remarkable testimony of a case of healing 
that came under his observation. He said a woman had been at- 
tended by a midwife and she, after several days, had developed 
blood-poisoning and was in a very critical condition. They called 
in this doctor. "Too late," he said, but he worked with all his might, 
with all the power he could muster, and with all of the intelli- 
gence that he had. He said two men came into the home and 
asked him if he would have any objection to them going in and 
administering to this woman, and he said : "None whatever." Then 
he asked these men if they had any objection to his going in with them. 
He said this bishop went in, together with his companion, clothed in over- 
alls, and one of them poured oil on the head of this woman. The other, 
in company with his companion, laid his hands upon her head and gave 
her a marvelous blessing. Then a beautiful smile came over her face 
and she said : "Now I shall live, doctor" ; and she lived. I have his 
letter with me, and he says in this letter that it was a power greater than 
his that restored the life of that individual. 

May God bless you, brethren and sisters. May you live your 
religion. May each of us appreciate our heritage, and may we 
live in such a manner that the Lord our God will continue to 
bless us, I humbly pray, in Jesus' name. Amen.

FIRST DAY 

AFTERNOON MEETING 

The second session of the Conference commenced at 2 o'clock, Fri- 
day afternoon, October 5. 

The Singing Mothers (Relief Society Chorus), under the direction 
of Sister Charlotte O. Sackett, furnished the music for this meeting. 

The Singing Mothers' Chorus and the congregation sang the hymn, 
"Come, come, ye Saints." 

The opening prayer was offered by Elder Zach J. Oblad, President 
of the South Summit Stake. 

A sacred anthem, "God is my Shepherd," (Schubert) was ren- 
dered by The Singing Mothers. 

ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 

First Counselor in the Presiding Bishopric 

For more than a quarter of a century it has been my good fortune 
and cherished privilege to labor with President Anthony W. Ivins, Pres- 
ident Charles H. Hart and Judge Franklin S. Richards. I sincerely hope 
and pray that when my work is finished in this sphere I shall be worthy to 
continue to labor with them. 

During the past month it was my pleasure to accompany the taber- 
nacle choir on an historic venture. After some weeks of negotiations 
and feverish days preparing for the trip, days that those who accompanied 
us little realized were trying, for to make the selection of those who were 
to go and try to pacify those who could not go gave to me and some of my 
associates sleepless and restless nights, and days filled with concern — on 
the 8th of last month the train with more than three hundred people left 
for the East. The joy of that group was increased when they found that 
we were to be accompanied by President Heber J. Grant and President 
J. Reuben Clark, Jr. I believe that the first interesting incident occurred 
when an order was placed by the dining car service for 750 bottles of 
milk. It was an unusual order, and I think the largest that has ever been 
let by the dining car service for one train. It was a tribute to the teach- 
ing of the Word of Wisdom. 

Our trip was uneventful until we reached Chicago, where we quickly 
boarded buses and were taken to our hotel and then to the Fair grounds. 
We were about twelve minutes late with our first concert. It was not 
altogether our fault ; the proper arrangements had not. been made and 
suitable dressing rooms had not been provided for such a large group. 

After the choir began its concert I took my position outside where 
I could see and hear, accompanied by the representative of the Ford Ex- 
position, with whom we had carried on our negotiations, this company 
having assisted in paying the expenses of the trip. He said nothing 



26 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



until the concert was over, and I turned to him and asked what he thought 
of it? 

"It is more than I expected. We did not even dream that we were 
getting anything like this," was his answer. 

Each day, during the time that we were there, their statement of ap- 
preciation was more pronounced. On the first day they invited Presi- 
dents Grant and Clark and their party to a luncheon in the Ford offices 
on the Fair grounds. 

It was an inspiring sight during that week to see the people come 
into the great Ford Gardens, two thousand or more at nearly every 
performance. At night nearly every seat was taken. Several nights 
every seat was taken, and one night nearly a thousand, as near as I 
could reckon, sat for more than a half hour in a rain storm to hear the 
balance of the program. 

During the week we were invited to sing on the street in Chicago. 
We left the hotel where we were staying, in a fleet of Ford cars as the 
guests of the Ford Motor Company, and were escorted through the 
streets of Chicago to the plaza between the Daily News and Chicago Civic 
Opera buildings, where the concert was given. It was a wonderful sight. 
As far as we could see the streets were filled with people anxious to hear. 
And as the choir began to sing the windows of the buildings thirty and 
forty stories high were filled with people. As I stood there and listened 
I thought of the contrast when about ninety years before our fathers 
had been driven from a city in Illinois by mob violence, and now we, 
their children, had returned, and on every hand found the spirit of kind- 
ness, and words of encouragement and praise. 

After the concert we were taken to the Fair grounds, where our 
afternoon concert was given, and afterwards from there to the Ford 
executive offices in their exhibition building, which had been cleared of 
office furniture, and the entire group were seated at tables and served a 
delightful luncheon. 

To my mind, the trip was a most wonderful event. We started on 
it with the spirit of the Psalmist of old : 

But I am poor and sorrowful : let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high. 
I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanks- 
giving. 

This also shall please the Lord. 

The humble shall see this, and be glad : and your hearts shall live that seek 
God. 

For the Lord heareth the poor, and despiseth not his prisoners. 
Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and everything that moveth 
therein. 

For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah : that they may 
dwell there, and have it in possession. 

The seed also of his servants shall inherit it ; and they that love his name 
shall dwell therein. 

On the Sunday before we left on our return trip, through the efforts 
of the Chicago branch presidency, we were permitted to hold services 
in the Rockefeller church on the campus of the Chicago University. The 



ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 



27 



building was filled. During the service President Grant addressed the 
congregation briefly, referring to the Articles of Faith of the Church and 
the Prophet's statement on government. His clear voice carried to all 
parts of the building and was very impressive. It was not the most 
pleasant place to sing in, because of the high ceilings and hard walls, 
which caused the sound to come back at the singers and interfere some- 
what with the tone. But it was a delightful experience and we were 
happy to be welcomed in that way. 

On our return trip we stopped at Independence, Missouri, and other 
places from which our forefathers had been driven. Upon arriving in 
Independence we gathered at the new auditorium of the Reorganized 
Church. We were received in a spirit of great friendliness. As President 
Grant and Frederick M. Smith, president of the Reorganized Church, 
made their way from their seats in the body of the house to the platform 
there was great applause. This, too, was not a pleasant place to sing in, 
for the unfinished condition of the building was such that it was difficult 
for the singers to hear the accompaniment, and the steep incline where 
the seats were placed made it impossible to develop a satisfactory tone 
quality. But the warmth of our welcome I am sure caused all to forget 
the unfinished condition of the building which interfered so much with 
the music. Again we were impressed with the remarks of our President 
as he stated the belief of this people and referred to the revelations of 
Joseph Smith, which should' also be believed in by his descendants, our 
kinsmen, who were entertaining us at that time. In all it was a choice 
occasion, and we came away feeling that it was good to have been there. 

The last stop was at Denver, where Brother Daynes had arranged 
with one of the newspapers for our appearance in the large Denver Civic 
Auditorium. This was an inspiring sight. The place was filled, even 
the gallery back of the drop curtain being fairly well filled with people, 
and the chairs on the stage surrounding the choir also. As the President 
made his appearance on the platform to acknowledge their greetings and 
welcome, there was great applause. He spoke for only a few minutes, 
expressing appreciation, and they applauded him as he left, as they also 
applauded the choir for their singing. It was a most wonderful trip, not 
primarily a missionary trip, but we hope, through the service rendered, 
to draw to the attention of those who were unacquainted with us, some- 
thing of the ideals and purposes of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints ; and I am sure that the fifty or sixty thousand people who 
came to hear us, and the untold numbers who listened in over the air dur- 
ing each concert were well pleased with what they heard. We feel that 
the trip was worth while. 

The choir members had with them the spirit of the Gospel; they 
were exemplary. At times I thought I became a nuisance to them, for it 
was my task to keep them on the job and to see that their concerts started 
on time. They were enthused over the privilege of going and each felt 
that the success of the whole venture rested upon him or her. 

As we left the hotel and were settling our accounts, the hotel man- 
ager said: "I hope you will come again. We have never before had 



28 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



such a gathering in this hotel. The maids have had very little to do. We 
have found no cigarette stumps, no; cigars, no burnt furniture or linen, 
and no whiskey bottles. Your group have been orderly ; iwe have hardly 
known that they were here. It was a pleasure to have you with us." 

I think that through our actions we preached the Gospel. 

On the Fair grounds we were given reduced rates for the choir mem- 
bers. Their badges took them into many of the concessions and many 
invited them in without cost. We found a friendly attitude wherever we 
went and came away feeling that we had performed a wonderful mis- 
sionary service. We had in mind constantly the saying of the Lord : 
"My soul delighteth in the song of the heart ; yea, the song of the right- 
eous is a prayer unto me, and it shall be answered with a blessing on their 
heads." We wanted a blessing. We felt the Lord was fulfilling his 
promise upon our heads, and we pray that his blessings shall continue 
to be upon us, that we may continue to serve him in song, in faith, and 
in a desire to be worthy of the blessings which he has bestowed upon us 
and which he has promised to bestow upon us all through our faithful- 
ness. May he so bless us, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JOHN V. BLUTH 

President of the Canadian Mission 

My brethren and sisters, I rejoice in the privilege of again 
attending conference. Since I was here before I have undergone 
a serious operation, but the blessings of the Lord brought me 
through. Through my own carelessness I have contracted a cold 
which makes me hoarse. 

During the past six months we have had the pleasure of hav- 
ing with us in the Canadian Mission Brother James H. Wallis and 
his wife, he acting as a patriarch in the mission for the purpose 
of giving blessings to the worthy Saints therein. He has been with 
us now a little over three months, and has nearly completed his 
work there. He is now working on the recording of the blessings 
he has given, that they may be mailed out to the respective mem- 
bers. It has been a spiritual blessing to us ; we do appreciate the 
inspiration that came to the brethren to send Brother Wallis into our 
midst. I think that from there he will go into the Northern States, 
the North Central States, and the Southern States missions for the same 
purpose. 

In visiting with the members, talking with them, and going 
confidentially into their lives, much good has been accomplished 
by Brother Wallis in bringing the Saints to a realization that the 
blessings of God can come only from living his commandments. 
All kinds of blessings may be conferred upon us, but to make them 
a reality in our lives depends upon how we live. Many who have 
never thought of it in that light have discovered that, in our 
Church, activity is life and inactivity is spiritual death. Wonderful 
promises have been given, depending upon their living nearer to 



ELDER JOHN V. BLUTH 



29 



the Lord, keeping his commandments, observing the Sabbath day 
and having prayer in their homes, living the Word of Wisdom and 
keeping the law of tithing. Some of them were under the impression 
that when they were in debt they owed no tithing, and there are 
hundreds of our people who are in debt; so, of course, comparatively 
little tithing has been paid under those conditions. But they have 
now become convinced that the Lord expects one-tenth of all that 
he gives unto them, whether or not they are in debt, and that 
leaves them the ninety per cent with which to take care of their 
own affairs, which includes their indebtedness. I think it will mean 
much to the spiritual life of our mission. 

I do not know of any time since I have been in the mission 
when our missionaries were more united, nor do I know of a time 
when they have better understood the responsibility of the position 
they occupy and what is required of them. I feel that to a great 
extent they are working because of their love of the work rather 
than merely measuring up to the regulations, and in so doing they 
are naturally keeping the missionary regulations. 

I pray God that he may bless us, that we may realize that he 
has given unto us the Gospel of his dear Son ; that it is given unto 
us to be lived, not to be stored away as something that is merely 
beautiful and grand, but something that we should live, that it 
may be exemplified in our lives, that we might eventually be fitted 
for an inheritance in his celestial kingdom. 

I bring greetings to you from the missionaries of the Canadian 
Mission. They love their work, they dread sickness and anything 
else that interferes with their work. They are having an enjoyable 
time together. We love the work in the mission field. To me 
there is no more glorious blessing that has come into our lives 
than has come to Sister Bluth and myself in missionary service. 
We rejoice in it, we thank the Lord for the privilege of being in the 
mission field. May his Spirit attend us continuously in our labors, 
that we may serve him faithfully all the days of our lives, that 
we may realize in our lives the things for which we hope and 
aspire, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER JOHN WELLS 

Second Counselor in the Presiding Bishopric 

I have been encouraged this morning and this afternoon with 
the advice, counsel and testimony, and the remarks of my brethren 
concerning our departed dead. The thought occurred to me, what 
a toll has been taken during the last three or four years from 
among the General Authorities of the Church : President Anthony 
W. Ivins, President Charles W. Nibley, Elder Orson F. Whitney, 
Elder James E. Talmage, President B. H. Roberts, President Rey 
L. Pratt, President Charles H. Hart, and Patriarch Hyrum G. 
Smith — almost one-third. But while I have missed them and shall 
miss them and their tremendous influence for good, and the power 



30 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



of their example, what a blessing it is for those on the other side 
where they will labor with the Prophet Joseph Smith and his 
associates, in carrying on the great work of redemption in the 
spirit world, where millions are waiting for the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ. 

And so our loss is someone else's benefit — the law of compen- 
sation still applies. 

I have been thinking very much lately concerning our service, 
one to another, and to the world. 

On the last day of the Master's public ministry he left Bethany 
accompanied by his disciples and made his way to the temple. 
The usual crowd, including those who were opposed to him, met 
him in the temple courts. The Pharisees and Sadducees plied him 
with questions, after which a lawyer or Scribe inquired of him, 
"Master, which is the greatest commandment of all?" The Savior 
quoted verses 4 and 5 of the 6th chapter of Deuteronomy and part 
of the 18th verse of the 19th chapter of Leviticus. It was required 
of every Jew to repeat the words contained in these verses twice 
each day. Therefore, his critics well knew the source of his an- 
swer. This is the answer the Master gave to the lawyer's question : 

The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel: The Lord our 
God is one Lord: 

And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all 
thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength ; this is the first 
commandment. 

And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as 
thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these. 

And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: 
for there is one God; and there is none other but he: 

And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and 
with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbor as 
himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices. 

And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, 
Thou art not far from the Kingdom of God. 

Thus the Master made clear to his audience and to the lawyer 
and to future generations that the first commandments are to love 
God and to love our fellow men. Love translates itself into service. 
The Master himself exemplified his doctrine by service to his fel- 
low men. Again and again did he show that love, indeed, it can 
only be evidenced by service. On another occasion he said to his 
disciples : 

Whosover will be great among you, let him be your minister; and 
whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant. (Matt. 20:28.) 

The Master himself performed the greatest possible service 
to humanity, for he spent three years of his life teaching men how 
to live and how to obtain eternal life, and he laid down his life that 
the resurrection and eternal life might be brought to pass. 

To love God means that we will not only keep his command- 
ments, but that we will qualify ourselves for the duties and re- 
sponsibilities required of all who accept the Gospel to proclaim the 
restored Gospel and the divine mission of the Prophet Joseph 



ELDER JOHN WELLS 



31 



Smith. I like the symbol found on an old Roman coin which bore 
the design of an ox standing between a plow and an altar, thus 
signifying its readiness for either service or sacrifice. No symbol 
could more beautifully represent the attitude of the true servant 
of the Master — ready, when the Master wills, to toil in his service ; 
and just as ready, when a call comes, to sacrifice everything, if 
necessary for the Gospel's sake. 

As to our neighbor, I like the thought expressed by King Ben- 
jamin in the 2nd chapter of the book of Mosiah : He who is in 
the service of his fellow men is in the service of his God. Today, 
men see more clearly than ever before that we are our brothers' 
keepers. How great, therefore, is the need of keeping constantly 
before us the second great commandment, and how far we are 
from observing it as the Lord requires, and we should frequently 
ask ourselves, What manner of men and women are we? 

The Lord has said this in Section 58 of the Book of Doctrine 
and Covenants : 

Verily, I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do 
many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness; 

For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves. And 
inasmuch as men do good they shall in nowise lose their reward. 

But he that doeth not anything until he is commanded, and receiveth a 
commandment with doubtful heart, and keepeth it with slothfulness, the 
same is damned. 

If we are profitable servants, we will go beyond the routine 
requirements of our membership in the Church, and we will devote 
ourselves more than ever to the service of our fellow men. 

Where shall we look for service? We must not repeat the 
experience of the knight in the ancient tale, who left his home 
when a young man to find the Holy Grail, or cup, out of which 
our Savior drank, and came back an old white-haired man, only 
to find the grail in his own house, where it had been all those 
years. 

As Latter-day Saints, there are many avenues for service in 
the organizations of the Church. We can be better neighbors and 
help the poor, the unfortunate, the aged, the feeble, the widow, 
and the orphan, who live around us. Fortunate are we if we have 
learned the great truth that happiness is not determined by how 
much we get out of life, but what we put into life in the way ofj 
helpfulness and service for others. For there is a richness in life 
that will come to every Latter-day Saint once he has experienced 
the joy that is to be found in helpful service to others. The happiest 
people on earth are those who contribute to the welfare of their 
neighbors and friends. 

The General Authorities of the Church, those who preside 
in the stakes and wards and missions, use their time and talents 
in the service of God and their fellow men and for the establish- 
ment of the Church of God for the preaching of the Gospel and for 
the dead. 

There is a wonderful field for all officers and members of the 



32 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



quorums of the Melchizedek Priesthood to increase the faith of 
their members and to see that every person holding this Priest- 
hood is giving service to the Lord and to his fellow men. 

The Presiding Bishopric deeply appreciate the untiring labors 
of the bishops of wards and those associated with them in develop- 
ing and training the youth of Zion who hold the Aaronic Priest- 
hood. The result of their labors is already being noticed in the 
improved standards of the members of this Priesthood. There are 
also under the direction of the bishopric approximately 30,000 
men holding the Priesthood whose duty it is to visit the homes 
of the Latter-day Saints monthly. They go in the true spirit of 
neighborly help to the members of their flock. 

On this Temple Block thousands of men and women hear the 
message of the Gospel, in addition to those who are reached by 
the labor of the missionaries who are out in the world proclaim- 
ing the restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ and the divine 
mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith. By this means the Church 
is exalted and advanced in its great purpose due to the devotion 
and labors of faithful men and women. 

The question might be asked, Is there recompense for all this 
labor? I say, Yes, for the Lord has said: 

And if it so be that you should labor all your days in crying repentance 
unto this people, and bring, save it be one soul unto me, how great shall be 
your joy with him in the kingdom of my Father. 

No person can be happy in this Church unless he is working 
for it, praying for it, and living for it. Service in the Church is a 
safeguard to youth. It is a blessing and protection to those of 
middle age. It is a crown of satisfaction to the aged. Our testi- 
monies and appreciation of this Latter-day work will grow in 
proportion to the service we render our Master, for service in the 
Church will bring joy, satisfaction, happiness, contentment, and 
appreciation. 

I pray that we may keep these two great commandments con- 
stantly in mind and in the spirit and intent of the Master's answer 
to the lawyer on that fateful last day of his ministry. Let us look 
around us for further opportunities to be useful in the communities 
where we live, that we may become more profitable servants in 
the cause of our Master. 

The Gospel of Jesus Christ is my meat and drink. I love to 
serve ; I want to serve ; I want to labor as long as I have the ability 
to do it in the cause of the Master and of my fellow men. 

The Gospel of Jesus Christ is true ; it is the power of God 
unto salvation. God lives. Jesus Christ is our Redeemer. Joseph 
Smith came in these latter days to restore the Gospel and establish 
the holy Priesthood preparatory to the coming of the Son of God, 
when his kingdom shall be established, and he shall reign in God's 
name upon the earth. 

I pray that we may be blessed with this deep sense of service 
and appreciation of our opportunities in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen.

ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

A year ago while occupying this position I advocated patience, 
— forbearance in reaching hasty and ill-considered conclusions re- 
specting the efficacy of the new plans which had been put into opera- 
tion to relieve our distresses and a patient compliance with their 
requirements. I believed then as I believe now, that the quickest 
and surest way to determine the real worth of any newly enacted 
policy is to give it a fair trial. I believe still that patience is neces- 
sary in the appraisement of the forces which have been set in action 
for the country's deliverance. However, I am equally well con- 
vinced that some things other than patience are requisite if we 
would make any real contribution to the ultimate end that every 
one desires. 

PHASES OF RELIEF PROGRAM CAUSE CONCERN 

I have had a limited opportunity to observe at rather close 
range, some of the operations of the great relief program which our 
government is seeking to carry out. There are phases of it which 
give cause for much concern. Some of these items would not be 
appropriate for discussion here, but there are one or two things 
which I feel can be mentioned with propriety and I hope with profit. 
The expenditures for relief, both direct and indirect are enormous, 
and the numbers of recipients almost go beyond the believable. In 
our own state, according to the latest figures obtainable 21.99% of 
the entire state population is on the relief rolls and in some counties 
the proportion of the population receiving relief runs as high as 
46%. Where these figures prevail, it means that nearly one-half 
of all the people have demonstrated to the satisfaction of those in 
charge that they are fit subjects for relief and are actually in receipt 
of the charities bestowed. I have not included in these statements 
vast numbers of people who have been beneficiaries under certain 
governmental emergency measures which have been calculated to 
save to the owners, homes and properties by the extension of extra- 
ordinary credit facilities, I am limiting the number only to those 
who are on the relief rolls of the counties and municipalities. When 
I mention the percentages in our own state I wish it known that 
our numbers are but representative of other states of the union. 

INDICATION OF SUFFERING AND DISTRESS 

I do not see how any thoughtful person can contemplate this 
situation without grave concern. I feel that concern very deeply, 
because this astonishing information indicates such a large meas- 
ure of want, failure, suffering and distress among the people. No 



34 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



one can think of it without having his sympathies touched. My 
first desire would be of course, that the cause of these distressing 
conditions might be removed, that we might immediately have such 
industrial recovery as to give all opportunity for work and a good 
livelihood. This is the desire of all, but how to bring about such a 
recovery is the subject for some of the hottest debates and con- 
tentions we have witnessed in this country for many a year. 

Into these I will not enter. Suffice it to say the conditions are 
here. How long they will last no one knows. We hope not for 
long. While they do last they are the immediate and pressing con- 
cern of every citizen of the country. No conscientious man nor 
woman can ignore them, for even from a selfish point of view they 
affect him. 

I take it for granted therefore, that everyone would like to do 
something to help. I am going to take the liberty of making some 
suggestions which I think can be adopted by almost every one 
who does desire to help. I am not going to speak now of the giving of 
financial aid. I hope to mention that later. 

MAINTAIN SELF-RESPECT 

It is my first suggestion that every man, woman and child ad- 
versely affected by this "depression" be encouraged to maintain self 
respect. I earnestly hope in what I am about to say I shall give 
no offense. I assure you none is intended. I desire only to be kind, 
but I know it is necessary sometimes to be frank and seemingly 
cruel in order to be kind. I know that there have been many hun- 
dreds of self-reliant, self-respecting, proud people who have been 
humiliated to the dust by the hard circumstances which have been 
forced upon them. My heart goes out to them. I pity them for the 
humiliation they have sustained, but strange as it may seem, for 
their own good, I want them to continue to be humiliated in their 
own feelings so long as they continue to be the recipients of char- 
itable relief. I said, mind you, in their own feelings. I ,want no 
undue embarrassment heaped upon them, but I want them to be so 
manly and so womanly in all those terms imply as to be grieved in 
spirit when they cannof be self-reliant and reasonably independent. 

FACTORS IN ECONOMIC AND SPIRITUAL WELFARE 

There is a pride in vanity "that goeth before a fall," but that 
pride in a man which makes him cherish his own good name and 
gives him the courage to work to sustain it, that pride which makes 
him shun the bondage of undischargeable obligations, that pride 
which keeps his head high even in poverty, conscious that he has 
always been honorable and has given the best that was in him, that 
pride I admire. I think too it is essential for the preservation of 
some of the best things within our civilization. Self-respect, self- 
reliance, and the pride of achievement I look upon as highly prom- 
inent factors in our economic welfare and in our spiritual as well. 



ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 



35 



CHARITY SEEKERS 

Unfortunately there has been another class of our citizens who 
have not had so much pride and self-respect and who have not been 
greatly humiliated, perhaps not humiliated at all in the receipt of 
those benefactions which have been bestowed upon them. They 
have been eager to receive. I suppose some of this class will al- 
ways be with us. I am sorry for them too because they lack an 
element of character which is essential to success and enduring hap- 
piness. 

"sponging'" on the government 

Now without mitigation in the least of our sympathies toward 
those unfortunate ones actually in need, the observing cannot help 
but note that there is an ever-growing and deeply regrettable tend- 
ency to "sponge" on the government and take every gratuity pos- 
sible to obtain and this too, sometimes by representation and con- 
nivance, which will not bear the light of truth. It is true also that 
this disposition to "sponge" on the government is not confined to 
those only who are on the relief rolls. 

In the obtaining of benefit loans and crop allocations with other 
concessions so lavishly bestowed it has been manifest in such degree 
and in such people as to be greatly astonishing to those who have 
the inside information. Not infrequently does one hear in pseudo 
justification of these regrettable actions, expressions such as these — 
"Well everybody's getting it, I might as well get my share" — or 
"The government brought on these conditions they should get us 
out." I have been informed of men making application for home 
loans under representations of distress whose regular income for 
one month would be regarded by many families as ample support 
for an entire year. 

CONTEMPT FOR IMPOSTORS 

I am not pointing out these things in criticism of the adminis- 
tration of the government's remedial plans, although I suppose it 
is possible to detect errors. I make allowance for the faults and 
abuses which almost of necessity must creep into the operation of 
such extensive schemes so quickly set up and manned. Nor do I 
particularly criticize the plans themselves, not because I do not see 
deficiencies in them, but because I find it most difficult to discover 
in my thinking or from the suggestions of others, any satisfactory 
substitute measures to take their place. Here is where I feel to 
exercise patience, but I am not patient with impostors on the gov- 
ernment's generosity. I tell you these professional charity seekers, 
these "spongers" on public beneficence are a menace to the morale 
of our country. They have lost self respect, they have lost their 
honor and their influence is pernicious. Any public official or ad- 
ministrator who connives with them or tolerates their practices is 
even more deserving of our contempt. 



36 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



FAR-REACHING RESULTS 

I am not willing to take it for granted that these abuses must 
be. They are too serious and their results too far reaching to go 
unchallenged. I fear them, not only because they are costly to the 
public treasury, the drain on which is a matter of deep concern to 
every American, but for the more important reason which I have 
heretofore indicated, that the practice of "sponging'' on the gov- 
ernment is perverting the finest virtues of American citizenship — 
self-respect, self-reliance and integrity. Furthermore, I cannot but 
conclude that this distortion to the morale of our people makes fer- 
tile ground for the seeds of disloyalty and anarchy which those 
inimical to our form of government are ever seeking to sow. 

THE LATTER-DAY SAINT ATTITUDE 

I said everyone could help. I believe everyone can. I believe 
our Church can help as can every other good agency. That is why, 
my brethren and sisters, I bring this matter to your attention here 
today. No Latter-day Saint can tolerate for a moment an imputa- 
tion against his honor and integrity . No Latter-day Saint can afford 
to be other than self-respecting and as self-reliant and independent 
as the circumstances will possibly permit. We have been taught 
all during our history the gospel of work, of self-support and free- 
dom from debt. It so hurts me to see a man lose the pride of self- 
respect and self-reliance that I could wish that it were feasible to 
take an evidence of obligation for every gratuity bestowed, in order 
that the recipients might say that they had borrowed the money 
and would pay it back and thus not be humiliated by the taking of 
alms. 

TO RESTORE OUR MORALE 

Morale is made by public opinion and public opinion is the 
composite of individual opinions. We can maintain our morale 
and if we have lost it in measure, we can restore it as can the coun- 
try at large by each and every one firmly and definitely resolving: 
first, that uniler no circumstances will he be guilty in the least de- 
gree of the abuses which I have mentioned, and secondly, that to 
the full extent of his ability he will see to it that such abuses are not 
tolerated in others. The cost of administration of the relief pro- 
gram is already so enormous (it seems excessive to us who ad- 
minister relief without cost) that there must not be added to the 
cost any additional funds for more supervision; so it is indispensable 
to the success of the program that everyone assume responsibility. 
By so doing, everyone can help. I do not know how long we shall 
retain our present methods. Whether they should be changed is a 
matter scarcely suitable for discussion here, but I do know that so 
long as we have them, we have a duty to get out of them the best 
obtainable. That is possible only by full co-operation. 



ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 



37 



I earnestly hope that my plea here today will not be misunder- 
stood. It may sound harsh and unfeeling, but I know that in my 
own heart I am not without charity and sympathy and I know that 
my people are generous and kind. When I think of what we give 
for charity and for the support of unselfish and noble causes, I am 
grateful and encouraged. 

LATTER-DAY SAINT LIBERALITY 

I noted the other day from information issued by the Federal 
Department of Internal Revenue, that the deductible charitable con- 
tributions of the rich men of America as shown by their income tax 
returns, did not exceed 2% of their net incomes. We who pay our 
tithing give 10% and to that we add many additional items, so that „ 
when we make our income returns to the government, if we are 
fortunate enough to have incomes sufficiently large to report, it is 
not infrequently the case that the 15% of net income which is de- 
ductible for tax purposes is not sufficient to cover all our contribu- 
tions and we sometimes pay a tax on our gifts. I am glad of this 
because it indicates our generosity and our truly Christian desire to 
help our fellow man. I feel that desire. I want to continue to give, 
not only because of continued need, but because giving is the best 
remedy in the world for contraction of the heart. I recommend it 
to all who suffer from that malady. 

OUTLOOK FOR COMING WINTER 

There is little prospect that the coming winter will not present 
enlarged demands on our sympathies and our resources. It has 
been indicated from Washington that the state and local com- 
munities may be obliged to bear a larger portion of the burden. I 
hope we will do our utmost and I pray that no worthy person who 
is honest and deserving may be permitted to suffer. I pray with 
equal fervor that no person may become so dishonest and disloyal 
as to be an impostor on the generosity of our great merciful gov- 
ernment which is seeking so diligently to relieve our distresses. 

BASIS OF MUTUAL CONFIDENCE 

Common honesty is the basis of mutual confidence. If we lose 
confidence in each other we are lost. We can't trust those who cheat 
the government. It is as dishonest as it is to cheat the Church or 
each other. No one can deceive and cheat and be a Christian. He 
may be called a Christian, but he is not one. Misrepresentation, 
hypocrisy and deceit are as repugnant to the Gospel as is error to 
truth, for the Gospel is truth. 

THANKFUL FOR CHURCH 

I thank God for the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Within it I find the 
true philosophy of life with all the virtues, the encouragements, the 



38 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



restraints, the hopes and the satisfactions that my soul can desire. 
I thank God for the Church of Christ with all its agencies, facilities 
and powers to make the Gospel effective in the lives of men and 
women. I look forward with confidence to the fulfilment of the 
promises of the Lord. In the face of many problems I am not dis- 
couraged — the truth will prevail. We must be patient in all things, 
but we must also be vigilant. Patience and vigilance and integrity 
will see us out. I pray for the blessings of God on the Church, on 
the Government and on all men, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER JOHN H. TAYLOR 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

I humbly pray, my brethren and sisters, that the Lord will 
bless me during the few moments that I am before you, that I 
might say correctly the things that I have a desire to say to you 
this afternoon. 

Our Heavenly Father has greatly blessed us by giving to us 
many books that we might learn of his ways and his desires con- 
cerning us ; that we might be able to find our way safely back into 
his kingdom after finishing our work here. In addition he has also 
given to us his prophet and his servants that they might give us, 
from time to time, additional word and counsel and instruction to 
that which we find written in the standard works of the Church. 

The scriptures have not only been given for our benefit but 
they have been given for the good of all of the children of God 
here upon the earth. They are encouraged to read them that they 
might better understand God's purposes towards them and to- 
wards life ; to make the present finer and more beautiful so that 
the future might bring increased joy and happiness. 

At times it seems to me that because of the many scriptures 
available, they have become very common to us. When problems 
of life come before us we are prone to look to other sources for 
comfort, knowledge, and instruction, rather than going to the 
word of the Lord, where we might be guided rightly in the things 
that he wants us to do. 

We are always having problems of religion before us, and I 
am sure that we always shall. This word of the Lord which has 
been given to us helps us to tread the straight and narrow path 
and keep close to our Heavenly Father. It is interesting, and I 
am sure profitable, that we should be up-to-date ; but it is more 
important that we be right, even at the expense of up-to-dateness. 

As I meet people I find there is a tendency to so interpret the 
scriptures that they will fit into all of the new theories, especially 
the so-called learning and intelligence that has not been estab- 
lished. Very frequently people in trying to fit these theories into 
the word of the Lord make the interpretations of our scriptures 
silly, and in many cases dangerous, leading men and women astray 



ELDER JOHN H. TAYLOR 



39 



because their new interpretation is not what God meant when he 
wrote and spoke to his prophets and gave his words to us in the 
holy scriptures. 

We sometimes wonder why more people are not coming into 
the Church nowadays, and we refer back in kindly remembrance to 
the many people who joined the Church in early days. I think I 
can name one reason. In the early days people of all the earth — 
I mean those who were Christians — were readers of the scriptures. 
They tried to find comfort and knowledge in this holy book, the 
Bible. They believed sincerely in the revealed word of God and 
when the missionaries came to them in their kindness and with 
their explanation of the additional word of God, they could see 
and understand their mistakes and readily adjust themselves to 
the new interpretation that had come in relation to the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ. And so, many people came into the Church. 

Nowadays we are getting away from that. It is not the custom 
to read the word of the Lord, and while we may find testimony, I 
believe that testimony would come quicker if we would be firmer 
in the foundation of the Gospel of Jesus Christ ; if we would be 
frequent readers of God's word to us, and really believe the things 
which he has said and does say to us. 

I believe many of these religious problems that come to us 
can be solved. For example, we have the question of Adam and 
Eve in the Garden of Eden. We know that Adam was an intelli- 
gent man. How do we know it? By the written word of God ; there 
is no question about it. Mark you, I said an intelligent man, and 
not a man who was just evolving from a crude state into one of 
intelligence. All of our reading and all of of our contact with God 
and his prophecies give us to understand that Adam was an in- 
telligent man and was the father of our race. We read of him in 
the Bible, and we read of him again in the Pearl of Great Price, 
where practically the same story is reiterated. We read about him 
again in the Book of Mormon and in the Doctrine and Covenants. 

It seems to me that this question should not bother us as a 
people when we have so much of the revealed word of God concern- 
ing this matter. In the Book of Mormon, Lehi makes the state- 
ment : "Adam fell that men might be ; and men are, that they might 
have joy." 

There is no question about it, you see, as far as we are con- 
cerned. And the continual argument and debate about a subject 
like this it seems to me would be displeasing to our Heavenly 
Father. 

We have the question of the Christ, his virgin-birth, and his 
resurrection. W T e find it contained in all of our books. Yet there are 
men and women and young people who do not believe, and they 
argue the question back and forth as to who he really was, whether 
or not he was in reality resurrected from the dead, and stands at 
the right hand of God. 

Perhaps you remember the occasion when Jacob was debating 



40 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



the question with Sherem concerning the Christ, and Jacob said 
to him, "Believest thou the scriptures?" Do you not see the first test 
— the prophets' test, God's test? It was right there — "Believest 
thou the scriptures?" And when Sherem said, "Yea," Jacob said: 

Then ye do not understand them; for they truly testify of Christ. Be- 
hold, I say unto you that none of the prophets have written, nor prophesied, 
save they have spoken concerning this Christ. 

When the Lord was speaking to the Jews he said : 

Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and 
they are they which testify of me. 

The Jews, with the books before them could not understand. 
Paul said that we can not understand the things of God without 
the Spirit of God. And so even with the scriptures before us ; if 
we will not show the signs of humility and of repentance, and a 
desire to know, we can not understand the things which are writ- 
ten in these books for us. 

In the Book of Mormon we have a challenge, as we have in 
the Bible. The Prophet Moroni said that if the Book of Mormon was 
read with a certain purpose, with the proper attitude towards the 
book, then God, by his Spirit, would enable the reader to under- 
stand whether the book was the word of God or not. 

May the Lord bless us, my brethren and sisters, that we will 
commence to pay more attention to the holy scriptures, that we 
may go to them to solve the problems as they come into our lives, 
because I am confident that within the books of God, in addition 
to what comes to us from our prophet, we can ascertain what 
God wants us to do, how far we shall go, and how we can please 
him from day to day. May he bless us to this end, that we might 
obtain additional light and comfort and blessing and eventually 
find our way into his kingdom, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus 
Christ, our Redeemer. Amen. 

ELDER ANTOINE R. IVINS 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

My beloved brethren and sisters, as I stand before you this after- 
noon I desire an interest in your faith and prayers. I hardly know what 
I shall be able to say, but I thank the Lord for the faith that he has given 
me in the Gospel, of which we are participants. I thank him that I can 
look into the future with reliance and faith, believing that he stands back 
of the purposes of this Church, and that he will guide it through, that he 
will give those of us who are faithful and rely upon him the power and the 
capacity to carry on. 

I believe that there exists in this body of Priesthood that we have 
before us today, a peculiar power and virtue, a reservoir of power, 
from which we derive our authority in doing the things we do as repre- 
sentatives of this people. I believe that it is by virtue of that authority 
which is vested in the people that the officers of this Church conduct its 
affairs in all this world. 



ELDER ANTOINE R. IVINS 



41 



I believe that you have authorized them to do so, and I believe 
that that authorization is borne 'out by God himself. 

There is a principle existent in the Church that the right to govern 
is derived from the common consent of those governed. That extends 
to all the offices of the Church. The bishop is appointed and approved 
by his ward ; the stake president is appointed and approved by his stake ; 
an apostle is appointed and approved by the Church ; and the President 
of the Church is appointed and approved by the Church. And when he is 
so approved as a prophet, seer and revelator, he has the right to stand 
at the head of the Church and determine its policies and practices. 

We have before us the scriptures, to which reference has been made 
this afternoon ; I am thinking especially of the Doctrine and Covenants. 
When the revelations in that wonderful book were given to the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, they were not all at once compiled and bound into their 
present form. The time came when that was done, and to make them 
effective and binding upon the body of the Church they were approved 
and accepted as the revelations of the Lord to the Church, and from then 
on we have deemed them as binding upon us. 

We must not forget, in this day of trial and tribulation and criti- 
cism that we are going through, that we have now at the head of the 
Church the very same authority that we had in those days, and that 
when the prophet of the Lord dictates a policy unto this people and that 
policy is approved by the body of the Church, it is just as binding upon 
.the Church today as at any time in its history; and no minority — no 
•matter how interested it may be in certain other practices that are not ap- 
proved by these policies — has the right to set itself up in direct opposition 
to this body of Priesthood, the representatives of which we are who 
.are gathered here today. 

We are the Priesthood, and together with the Authorities who are 
placed over us, we control the destiny of this Church, and it is the duty of 
the rank and file of the Church to remember this one thing, that the 
Priesthood vested in the President authorizes him, when we support him, 
to dictate the policies that the time demands. 

I for one propose to stand back of the Authorities of the Church 
as long as God will give me power ; and to support every righteous thing 
that they propose, especially when it is approved by the body of the 
Priesthood. 

There are certain changes that have been authorized and approved 
by the body of the Priesthood, which are meeting with opposition at this 
time and, it is my testimony to you that there is no legitimate ground for 
this opposition. 

I trust that the Lord will give us strength to see our duty, to see the 
right, to sustain and uphold the policies of this Church when they are 
founded upon this principle that I have enunciated, for I believe that is 
the principle that should govern the Church. The Lord has told us so in 
the Doctrine and Covenants, and the leaders of the Church have reiterated 
it from time to time; and in promulgating these policies they stand 



42 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



upon that principle, and no other. To me that is justice and right and 
common sense. 

I hope that the Lord will bless me with the power that I may carry 
on, that I may see my duty properly and correctly and be able to fulfill it 
completely. I trust that the same blessing may be meted out to every 
man who holds the Priesthood in this Church, that he may realize the 
tremendous responsibility that rests upon him when he accepts that 
Priesthood, for it is no idle thing to permit a servant of the Lord to lay his 
hands upon your head and ordain you to the Priesthood. You accept 
the responsibility and the duty, and it is your obligation to magnify that 
calling. 

We have different orders in the Priesthood, and the callings of 
all are not the same, but be they great or small, when we accept those 
callings we have no right to refuse to discharge the duties that devolve 
upon us under them. 

I hope that the Lord will bless us, that he will pour out his Spirit upon 
us, that he will give us the power to carry on properly. 

I was especially pleased with what Brother Richards said this af- 
ternoon about the conditions of the time, and I wish to say amen to his 
suggestion. In going out among the people I have learned that, almost 
without exception, those people who have obeyed the instructions that 
have so many times been given from this stand, who find themselves 
free of debt, are not suffering in this crisis. 

We are ambitious, it is true, and many of us desire the power that 
comes from large property holdings, and to get that power we have 
shouldered upon our backs obligations that we are now unable to fulfill ; 
but I find that those people who are content with less, who were out of 
debt when this thing broke, are not suffering now like the people who 
found themselves heavily involved. 

I wish to bear my testimony of the truth of the work in which we 
are engaged, and to take my seat, praying that the Lord will bless me 
always with his Holy Spirit, and you as well. And I do it in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I desire to read my remarks made at the funeral of Brother Charles 
H. Hart, so that they may be in the Conference Pamphlet. They are as 
follows : 

"From my personal association during all the years that Brother Hart 
was one of the General Authorities of the Church I am able to bear wit- 
ness to all of the splendid things that have been said here today regard- 
ing his character. There was no one of the General Authorities with 
whom I traveled from stake to stake, in fulfilling the duties devolving * 
upon us of attending quarterly conferences, that I enjoyed traveling with 
more than I did Brother Hart. The sincerity and honesty, the integrity 
and devotion of the man always impressed me. He was a man whom to 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



43 



know was to love. Love begets love. He was a man who loved the 
people, loved to mingle with them, loved to gather evidences, as has been 
said here, of the divinity of the work in which you and I are engaged, 
and to be in a position to defend it. 

A RIGHTEOUS JUDGE 

It is a wonderful thing to be a judge and to have the reputation 
among all those who knew him that his decisions were absolutely true 
and straight, and what they ought to be according to the evidence pre- 
sented. To my mind the greatest tribute that could be paid to a man is 
that those who know him best love him most, and I am sure that this 
tribute can be paid to Brother Hart and that he is worthy of it. 

ENGAGED IN A NOBLE CAUSE 

There are many of us who make friends and sometimes make 
enemies. If Brother Hart had an enemy I have never heard of it. I 
have always heard people speak of him in the highest terms. To have 
a perfect and abiding knowledge that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, 
the Redeemer of the world, and that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God, 
and to devote the best that is in us to carry that knowledge to others and 
to inspire others to try to obtain it, is the highest labor I believe in which 
any of us can be engaged, and this was the labor of Brother Hart during 
the latter part of his life as one of the General Authorities of the 
Church, and it was a labor thatihe took pleasure in performing. 

RICH BLESSINGS EARNED 

I rejoice in all the splendid things that have been said here today. 
I commend to his wife and his children that they read the seventy-sixth 
section of the Doctrine and Covenants, telling of the marvelous and 
wonderful blessings that shall come to those who embrace the Gospel 
and live it, and of the promises that are made to them concerning the life 
to come. 

I have no hesitancy whatever in assuring the beloved wife and splen- 
did family that all of those marvelous blessings promised to those who 
shall endure to the end and keep the commandments of the Lord, that 
they shall inherit celestial glory, shall come to Brother Hart. There is 
nothing I can urge upon* the family more than to follow in his footsteps 
and walk in the narrow and straight path that he walked in during his 
entire life. 

NOT IN THE GRAVE 

I can never think of my loved ones, my, dear mother and those who 
have passed away, as being in the grave. I rejoice in the associations they 
are enjoying and in the pleasure they are having in meeting with their 
loved ones on the other side. 

May God help each and all of us to so order our lives that they will 
be a proclamation of the divinity of the work in which we are engaged.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



And may that sweet and peaceful influence that comes from our Heav- 
enly Father in times of sorrow be given to the wife and her children. 
May they be comforted, encouraged and blessed in their time of sorrow,

ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 

Of the Council of the Twelve Afbstles 

I desire that I may have the blessing- of the Lord, that the few 
moments I occupy will be profitable to us all. We have had a de- 
lightful time thus far. I have enjoyed the privilege of greeting so 
many of my brethren and sisters that I do not frequently see. Today 
I have come here with a prayer in my heart that we may continue 
to enjoy the favor of the Lord, bestowed upon us so richly in the 
past. 

A MARVELOUS CHANGE 

Sixty-nine years ago today a general conference of the Church 
was held in this building. The first to be enjoyed here. What a 
marvelous change has been wrought during the period of time that 
has elapsed since then ! How the Lord has preserved this people ! 
We have become somewhat popular with many of our Father's chil- 
dren in the world now, but in those days there were few, not mem- 
bers of this Church, who dared to even suggest that they were 
friendly to the Church. But the Lord promised those who came 
out from Nauvoo that if they would migrate into the tops of these 
mountains and live according to his teachings, they would be a happy 
people. That is the promise of our Heavenly Father to all who seek 
him and keep his commandments. 

RECIPE FOR TRUE HAPPINESS 

During these troublous times when so many are in distress, 
seeking happiness and not finding it, I think the finest recipe that 
I could give, to obtain happiness, would be: Keep the command- 



48 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ments of the Lord. That is easy to remember, and if we will do 
that we may be sure of success. 

All down through the ages the Lord has inspired his choice 
servants and they have taught the people the Gospel, they have 
pointed outj the way of true happiness. And yet, by his cunning crafti- 
ness Satan has persuaded the majority of mankind from walking in 
that pathway that will insure happiness, and he is still busy. That is one 
thing you may be sure of, that the adversary of righteousness never 
sleeps. 

Yesterday reference was made to the fact that there are some 
of our brethren and sisters who may be influenced if they are not 
careful, into following unwise leadership in their efforts to obtain 
food, raiment, shelter, etc. Remember one of the oldest of the Lord's 
commandments, "Thou shalt not covet." 

OLD AGE PENSIONS 

A man this morning stopped me as I came down the street, 
and requested me to sign a petition. I asked "What is it?" He said : 
"You believe in old-age pensions, don't you?" And I replied: 
"Well, my brother, I have always believed in caring for old age, 
and I have been making contributions for old age ever since I was 
a wage-earner, in some form or another ; but," I asked, "does your 
petition suggest $200 a month for all those past sixty years of age?" 
He said : "Yes." I said, "Well, that appears to me to be excessive. 
I cannot see any justification for that." 

"Now," I said, "do not misunderstand me. I am not complaining 
at anything that may be done for sixty-year-old people who, by 
reason of indigent circumstances and distresses, are not able to take 
care of themselves. I am not opposed to something being done 
to provide the means whereby they may live and be comfortable, 
but," I said, "this proposition of yours appears unreasonable to 
me." I hope I didn't wound his feelings. I had no desire to do so. 
I have always desired to be kind, especially to those in distress. 
We are likely, if we are not careful, to run off on a tangent, follow- 
ing some new idea, and if we will just pause long enough to consider and 
investigate, we will discover that it is not workable. 

THE LORD'S WAY 

The Lord, in his mercy, has told us much that we should do. 
He has instructed us to be industrious. During this conference 
reference has been made to the fact that we should go to bed early 
and arise early, after being refreshed. That is the Lord's advice to 
us. Among the things that come to my mind just now, that our 
Heavenly Father has suggested to us, is that we honor the Sabbath 
day and keep it holy ; that we observe the Word of Wisdom ; that 
we keep ourselves clean and pure and unspotted from the sins of 
the world ; that we love one another ; that we go about doing good. 
In fact, there are so many things that I will not take time to men- 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 



49 



tion them to you this morning, but you know what I mean, — the Lord's 
way, not man's way. 

That is why this Church was organized, in order that we might 
be directed by the influences of our Heavenly Father. That is the 
purpose of it, to prepare us for eternal life in the celestial kingdom. 
When I think of the great and good men and women who have 
lived in this Church from the beginning, who have gone through all 
kinds of hardships, and have remained faithful to their trust and gone 
home, I think what a marvelous example has been set us ! 

We saw portrayed, last night, in the beautiful pageant present- 
ed here, some of the experiences of Wilford Woodruff, who lived 
to be 92 years of age, retaining his faculties ; and almost the last 
thing that he did was to express his desire to those around him that 
they should honor God and keep his commandments. 

OUR LEADERS TODAY 

We are here this morning in a worshipping capacity, to wait 
upon the Lord. We are assembled under the presidency of the man 
who has been called to direct the policy of this Church, associated 
with his counselors and the other brethren. These are our leaders 
today. My heart is full of gratitude that I am permitted to be here. 
I regret that Brother Joseph F. Merrill, of the Council of the 
Twelve, cannot be with us, but he is in the line of his duty, per- 
forming a splendid service as president of the European Mission. 
I am grateful for the privilege that is mine to mingle my voice and 
associate with my brethren and my sisters in this, one of the great 
semi-annual conferences of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints. 

SHOULD BE INDUSTRIOUS 

We live in perilous times. We need the inspiration of our 
Heavenly Father. We can't expect it unless we keep his command- 
ments. He said long, long ago there were idlers in Zion, and he 
complained at them, and he said, "He that is idle shall not eat the bread 
nor wear the garments of the laborer." I am assuming that he did not 
mean those who cannot find employment, and who are legitimately trying 
to take care of themselves. I am assuming that he referred to the habit 
some people get into of leaning upon their neighbor. Maybe that 
is the wrong interpretation, but that is the way I view it. I feel 
that there has been no justification given to any man in this world 
to feel that he can depend on somebody else to provide him a live- 
lihood. I did not feel when I was a child that somebody would be 
compelled to provide me a means of living. The Lord gave me intel" 
ligence. He directed that I should work, and I began to work 
when I was twelve years of age, and I found joy in it, and have 
earned my living and helped others during more than fifty years. 

I thank God for work, for the joy that comes from doing things 
in the world. I am not indicating any particular kind of employ- 
ment except that it be honorable. But the Lord has indicated that 



50 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



we should be industrious. In ancient times he said that we should 
earn our living by the sweat of our face. There are means available 
today whereby, if we were keeping all of the commandments of 
our Heavenly Father, there would be employment for every one 
of us that would occupy most of our time. 

THE FAULTS OF OTHERS 

' This morning, not in criticism, not in a spirit of fault-finding 
I plead with you my brethren and my sisters, let us be generous 
with one another. Let us be as patient with one another as we 
would like others to be with us. Let us see the virtues of our neigh- 
bors and our friends and speak of those virtues, not find fault and 
criticize. If we will do that we will radiate sunshine, and those who 
know us best will love us. 

I read some time ago, in one of the old records of the Church, 
that from this very stand a sermon was preached in which one of 
the brethren called attention to the fact that in a group of ten men 
and women, assembled together and examined each apart from 
the others, saying, "I would like you to tell me what you think of 
these, your associates," the first one explained that they were good 
people but each had an outstanding fault, and he said each one of 
them found fault with every other one of that group, but they for- 
got to criticize themselves. Out of the ten that had been assembled 
and given an opportunity to talk, nine people could find fault with 
all of the others, but the nine people did not find in themselves any 
fault at all. Now, let us think of that. That was right from this 
very stand years ago. 

Aren't we rather prone to see the limitations and the weak- 
nesses of our neighbors? Yet that is contrary to the teachings of 
the Gospel of Jesus Christ. There is a class of people who find fault 
and criticize always in a destructive way. There is a difference in 
criticism. If we can criticize constructively under the influence of 
the Spirit of the Lord, we may change beneficially and properly 
some of the things that are being done. But if we have the spirit 
of fault finding, of pointing out the weaknesses and failings of 
others in a destructive manner, that never comes as the result of 
the companionship of the Spirit of our Heavenly Father and is 
always harmful. 

FOLLOWING THE NARROW WAY 

If in our own homes we have family prayers and teach our 
children to pray and walk uprightly before the Lord, we are in the 
narrow way. If we teach our children to thank the Lord for the 
food that we have, and feel to appreciate our blessings, we are in 
the narrow way. If we, when we are called upon to do ward teach- 
ing, go into the homes of the Latter-day Saints as servants of the 
Lord, and call the family together and teach them the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ, point them to the pathway that leads to eternal hap- 
piness, we are in the line of our duty and pleasing the Lord. 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 



51 



So I might go on and enumerate many things, little things that 
we see around us every day, but they are important. We should 
attend to our secret prayers. We should live so near to our Heav- 
enly Father that when we bow before him we may know that the 
thing we are asking will be pleasing unto him, and if it isn't grant- 
ed in the way that we ask it we may know that the blessing will 
come to us that we are entitled to and that will really be a blessing. 

IN THE HOMES OF THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS 

I have shaken hands during this conference with a number of 
my brethren and my sisters. How happy I am to have this oppor- 
tunity! I have been in your homes during the last few years, at 
intervals. I have had joy when I have stepped into the homes of 
the Latter-day Saints, and when I went in I found the inspiration 
of the Spirit of the Lord there. I found politeness and kindness 
among the children of the household. I saw cleanliness and good 
order in the house. I felt an influence of appreciation and gratitude 
for the blessings of our Heavenly Father. That made me happy. 
I have had joy and I am grateful for it, and this morning I thank you 
who have been so kind to me for your good care of me and my brethren. 

IN THIS BUILDING 

I have mentioned the fact that here, sixty-nine years ago, this 
building was opened, and from that time until now many marvelous 
instructions have been given to the Latter-day Saints. I have been 
in this house when the Spirit of God has been poured out upon us 
and there were few eyes not moistened by tears. Our souls were 
subdued. We felt to repent of our sins. When we possess the 
Spirit of the Lord we always have the spirit of repentance. When- 
ever our hearts are hard and we can't repent, we may know that 
we have not a proper spirit. So today I am thinking of the teach- 
ings that have echoed in this grand old building that is world- 
famous now because of what has been accomplished here. 

The Tabernacle Choir has called the attention, I might say, of 
the entire world, by now, to the fact that there exists an excellent 
musical organization in the great "Mormon" Tabernacle, accom- 
panied by this wonderful organ. They are preaching the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ, and we are beneficiaries of that blessing. 

THREE MIGHTY MEN 

We have referred during this conference to three mighty men 
recently called home who have discussed the principles of the 
Gospel from this very pulpit and exhorted us to obey our Father in 
heaven, in preparation for life in his celestial kingdom. I am think- 
ing of the praiseworthy things that have been said about our 
brethren who have just left us. We remember them and their 
virtues just as we remember the last conference, and we remember 



52 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



the last conference as the best conference that we ever had be- 
cause we are close to it. How fine it would be if we could remember 
all the truths that we have heard in the other conferences, not 
only remember them now, but if we could treasure them during 
life — retaining the teachings of the Lord which came to us through 
his servants. 

LEADERS WHO HAVE GONE HOME 

Here have stood some of the greatest men that have ever lived 
upon the earth, marvelous men, who have finished their work and 
gone home. I feel impressed to mention the names of some of those 
who from this pulpit have instructed the Latter-day Saints in the 
years gone by. Brigham Young, a mighty pioneer and leader of the 
Church ; John Taylor, Wilford Woodruff, Lorenzo Snow, Joseph F. 
Smith. Think of these men who have passed on, these men that we 
love and venerate. Heber C. Kimball, George A. Smith, George Q. 
Cannon, John R. Winder, Anthon H. Lund, Charles W. Penrose, 
Daniel H. Wells, John Henry Smith, Orson Hyde, Orson Pratt, Ezra 
T. Benson, Charles C. Rich, Erastus Snow. These men were not or- 
dinary men. They were super-men that God called to lead the 
people to the valleys of these mountains and instruct them in those 
pioneer days. Franklin D. Richards, Brigham Young, Jr., Francis 
M. Lyman, George Teasdale, Marriner W. Merrill, Abram H. Can- 
non, Abram O. Woodruff, Charles W. Nibley, John Smith, Hyrum 
G. Smith, Joseph Young, Levi Hancock, Zebedee Coltrin, Albert 
C. Rockwood, Horace S. Eldredge, Jacob Gates, John Van Cott, 
William W. Taylor, Seymour B. Young, C. D. Fjeldsted, John Mor- 
gan, Brigham H. Roberts, George Reynolds, Edward Stevenson, 
Joseph W. McMurrin, Rey L. Pratt, Edward Hunter, William B. 
Preston, Orson F. Whitney, James E. Talmage and many others. 

I will not take time to refer to more. The list is long but as 
I think of the men in the years that have passed, who have devoted 
themselves to the Church until the Lord summoned them home, 
I marvel at the strength of our leadership. I have missed the 
names of some of the leaders who have stood here, but these are 
those that have come into my mind. 

OPPORTUNITY FOR PREPARATION 

This is the Lord's work. This is not the work of man. If we 
desire to be identified with the kingdom of our Lord, the celes- 
tial kingdom, this is our opportunity to prepare, — with love un- 
feigned, with industry, with thrift, with perseverance, with a de- 
sire to do all that is within our power to bless others, to give — 
not to be always feeling we must receive, but desire to give, for I 
say to you: "It is more blessed to give than to receive." The 
Gospel of Jesus Christ is a gospel of giving, not only of our sub- 
stance but of ourselves, and I thank my Heavenly Father that I 
belong to such an organization that has been so instructed. 



ELDER ALONZO A. HINCKLEY 



53 



SUSTAINING OUR LEADERS 

I pray that the Spirit of God may be in your hearts and in 
your homes. Let us hold up the hands of these men who preside 
over us. Vacancies have occurred. They have been filled by serv- 
ants of the Lord, men that he has chosen, and the vacancies that 
will be filled now and henceforth will be filled by men that the 
Lord has selected to be our leaders and our advisers and our coun- 
selors. I hope that we will be found in the line of our duty, praying 
for and sustaining our present leaders, blessing them by our kind- 
ness and our love, and presenting them before our Heavenly Father 
in our daily prayers, asking him that he will give them the richness 
of his love and blessing. 

I am thankful again, from the bottom of my heart, for my 
membership in this Church. I know that this is God's work. I 
know that Jesus is the Christ. I know that Joseph Smith was a 
prophet of the living God. I know that the men that have suc- 
ceeded him as presidents of this Church have been leaders by di- 
vine appointment. I bear you my witness of it and express to you 
again my gratitude to have been associated with this work of our 
Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord, Amen. 



ELDER ALONZO A. HINCKLEY 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles and President of the 
California Mission 

My brethren and sisters, my soul is subdued. I had never dreamed 
of such a thing, never heard an intimation of such a thing as my being 
called into the Council of the Twelve. I stand before you as one who 
needs your supporting power for a few minutes. 

I have thought in the last few minutes of my father, who is dead 
and gone. I have grown up in the Church, known all the Authorities 
since Brigham Young and loved them, sustained them, honored them, 
have been impressed by them, inspired by them. But my father, to 
him is the glory of having taught his family by a noble example, 
by devotion to the truth, by a humble reverence for the Authorities 
of the Church and loyalty to them all. To my father I give credit, 
leading his family, as man should lead, by the eloquent life that he led. 
His words were few but his example was true. No soul, in the presence 
of my father, was ever permitted to lift his voice and speak words against 
the Authorities of this Church, without my father offering an objection. 
I think of him in his teachings, in his prayers. My father prayed; he 
didn't say his prayers. We knew what was in his heart. We knew 
that for which he struggled, and we followed him. 

May I pay a tribute to my mother, who, in the days when my 
father was called away from home, never permitted us to forget our 



54 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



prayers, never failed to kneel in the group. Now I can understand, in 
these more mature years of my life, her spirit when she tiptoed upstairs, 
when all was quiet below and we were tucked away in our beds, and she 
would sit on the edge of the bed and make inquiries, intimate, close in- 
quiries : "Have you said your prayers ?" "Yes." "Did you remember 
your father who is away ?" Sometimes we had to admit thinking father 
was so big and great and strong he could meet any situation, had to 
admit perhaps we had not felt the necessity of praying for him. "Did you 
pray for those who have not comfortable beds as you have ? Did you pray 
for those who have not food to eat nor raiment to wear?" So today I 
pay tribute to that angel mother who left an impression so deep that it 
has never gone out of the hearts of her children. Blessed be her name ! 

Now permit me to pay tribute to the good people with whom I labor. 
I have sat in meditation this morning, as I came away from the bed of an 
Elder who had returned from his mission and been back to his home. His 
friend called up and said : "Could you come down and" bless Elder 
?" I said : "I will come right down before meet- 
ing." As I sat there and looked at him and thought of him as one who 
had served as a district president, now needing help, I asked the Lord 
to give him the faith that I knew he had exercised when he was in the 
mission field, when he could call upon the Lord to heal the sick through 
the laying on of hands. I asked the Lord to remember him. I say I 
came away meditating. I thought: How blessed is my life, associated 
with these young men, pure and undeflled, who go forth in the strength 
of their young manhood, under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, di- 
vinely commissioned to speak in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, fear- 
ful of no man, conscious of their responsibility and conscious of their 
authority, teaching that which they do know to be true. I say I medi- 
tated and thought : What a blessed man am I to be associated with such 
as these. I thought of the Saints down in the mission. How I 
love them ! I thought of the sixty men who preside over the branches 
and direct the destinies of those thirteen thousand Latter-day Saints. 
Oh, what men they are ! I said in my soul : "What hath God wrought !" 
He raised up these righteous people, who, without thought of cost of ef- 
fort or time, offer a consecrated service that commands the attention of 
the world. 

Our greatest sermon in every case, I think, is our manner of life. 
Do we testify with our lives that we have found the truth, that we love 
the truth, that we live the truth, and that the truth and the living of the 
truth brings into our lives, soul satisfactions that cannot be found else- 
where or in any other way? 

I bear my testimony. I also testify of the Saints in the California 
Mission, of their unity, of their love, of their good works. 

Now, all I can say, the Lord being my helper is I will just do my best. 
I think I could quote, with propriety, the prayer of David: "Let the 
words of my mouth, let the meditation of my heart be acceptable unto 
Thee, O Lord, my strength, my Redeemer." Amen. 



ELDER JAMES M. KIRKHAM 



55 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

There are twenty mission presidents here, including those actively 
engaged and those who have been released. I regret that it will be 
impossible to get through our conference in the specified time if we 
give all of these brethren an opportunity to speak to us. We shall call 
on those who have been recently appointed, and ask each mission 
president to not occupy more than ten minutes. 

ELDER JAMES M. KIRKHAM 

President of the East Central States Mission 

I pray that the Lord will bless me while I stand here before 
you. I want to report to you the condition of the East Central 
States Mission. We are happy in our work and the Lord is bless- 
ing us. We need more help in the mission field, and I believe that 
will be true in nearly all of the missions. I know it is in our mission 
field. 

I would like to encourage you, my brethren and sisters, to send 
your sons and daughters into the mission field. I think I can speak 
truthfully and with knowledge, having sent seven of my own chil- 
dren into the mission field, when I say to you that the Lord will 
bless you if you will do it. I know that' he has blessed me. I know 
that he has provided the way, and from that point of view I can 
speak to you sincerely and say to you, if you will exercise your 
faith in our Heavenly Father he will provide the way for them to 
go. 

It is but a short time after these young men and women come 
into our field — even at the door, when we greet them at the mission 
home, — when we feel that we are acquainted with them. It is but 
a day or two until we fairly love them and make them as part of 
our own family. It is wonderful to labor with these young people. 
Their example, their lives, their every word is watched by the 
people with whom they labor. I believe, my brethren and sisters, 
if we would preach a sermon that would be powerful and of great 
worth we must live the Gospel of Jesus Christ, because our lives 
and our actions are watched. I know this from the experience I 
have gained in the short time that I have been away, from people 
who report to us who have visited here in Utah. 

The Saints in the East Central States Mission are very much 
scattered. There are but few places where there are any number 
of our people who meet together. For this reason we have a great 
problem in teaching them spirituality and keeping them active in 
church work. We have been teaching them to pray ; the two breth- 
ren who have preceded me have spoken on this subject, and I want 
to emphasize the power of prayer. I believe that we do not pray 
sincerely enough sometimes. We pray, I know, but "Prayer is the 
soul's sincere desire, uttered or unexpressed." I want you, my 
brethren and sisters, to pray for me, to pray for the missionaries

who are away, because we need your faith and your sustaining 
power. The prayer of the righteous man availeth much. 

May the Lord bless us and help us to carry on, to preach the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ in the world, to warn the people of the 
coming day when our Savior will be here, because I honestly be- 
lieve that that time is not far distant. The prophecies that have 
been made concerning the coming of this event are being fulfilled. 

My brethren and sisters, may the Lord bless you, and help us 
all to so live and conduct our lives that we will be worthy of the 
blessings that we so much desire from him from time to time, is 
my prayer and blessing, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

At the request of President Heber J. Grant the congregation arose 
and sang the hymn "Guide us, O thou Great Jehovah." 

ELDER WILFORD W. RICHARDS 

President of the North Central States Mission 

My brethren and sisters, on this, my first appearance in this 
capacity, I feel indeed my humility. In the presence of that list, 
that great galaxy of leaders of this Church just referred to by 
Brother Smith, who have stood in this pulpit, and who have for 
these sixty-nine years administered the truths of the Gospel here, 
I indeed feel as though I stand upon sacred ground. I have the 
same feeling of humility with respect to the new responsibilities 
that have come to me recently in connection with the North Central 
States Mission, and I pray most humbly that my Father in heaven 
will be kind to me, and magnify those meager powers with which 
I have been blessed to his service and to his good. 

The missionaries and the Saints of the North Central States 
Mission are thoughtful of the Authorities of this Church and of you, 
my brethren and sisters, who constitute the Church at large. They 
send their love, their expressions of loyalty and their good will. 
They desire to be known as energetic workers in the field of serv- 
ice, and interested in the activities and growth of this great cause. 

Just a few days ago Sister Richards and I sat at a banquet 
table in the Minneapolis branch. A survey disclosed the fact that 
we were the only ones in that group who had been born and reared 
in the Church. The remainder were those who had heard the Gospel 
truths in this or other lands and had responded to the call. As we 
discussed with them their growth in the Church and their interest 
in it, their countenances beamed with joy as they enumerated the 
great good that had come into their lives as a result of their re- 
sponse to the truth. 

I have always been interested, my brethren and sisters, in see- 
ing the fruits in the lives of the individuals of the earth who would 
accept the truths of the Gospel and attempt to apply them. I see 
here, in this experience and others of which this is only typical, that 



ELDER WILFORD IV. RICHARDS

great perpetual miracle by which our Father in heaven takes the 
souls of his sons or daughters and remakes them for his service. 
Many of them have given up habits that are unclean, given up 
practices that were injurious, and given their lives and souls to the 
growth, development, and power of the service of God. I have al- 
ways been interested in the spiritual responses that come to those 
who have attempted to apply themselves to the truth, but this has 
impressed me more in the mission field of recent date, I think, than 
ever before. So I desire that we, as members of this great kingdom 
of our Father in heaven, may be ever worthy of that touch of his 
which will inspire in us a desire to grow in the direction of service. 

Today I appreciate the opportunity of gathering with you. I 
appreciate the confidence of my brethren. I appreciate my asso- 
ciation with the missionaries and the Saints of the world. I rejoice 
in the vital fires which the Gospel is able to kindle in the lives of 
those who are willing to serve and to put themselves in harmony 
therewith. 

May God bless us that we may exemplify in our lives that 
thing which the Savior meant when he said : "By their fruits ye 
shall know them," to the end that the fruits of our lives may be 
always the fruits of righteousness, fruits of service, fruits of glory 
unto his name everlasting. 

I bear you my testimony to the divinity of this great work and 
the power of it in our lives, if we will but apply it. May God bless 
us that we may serve him earnestly and humbly, I pray in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER JOSEPH QUINNEY, JR. 

President of the Northwestern States Mission 

I appreciate beyond my power to express the great privilege 
that has come to me in again acting as a missionary in the nations 
of the world. I am grateful that I find myself in full fellowship, 
sustaining and upholding the Authorities of this church, for I be- 
lieve that they are inspired by the light and power of God, our 
Eternal Father, to lead and direct his people in the paths of right- 
eousness, and their appreciation for this great and mighty work is 
inspiring and uplifting. 

I should like to say just a word in reference to my predecessor, 
President Sloan. He has done an excellent work in the Northwest- 
ern States Mission. He has endeared himself to the hearts of 
many people. They appreciate his labors. It is my pleasure to re- 
port that one of the outstanding features since we have been called 
into the ministry is the tour around the mission that we made in 
August with Apostle Reed Smoot and his wife. Everywhere we 
went we were greeted with crowded houses. Our chapels were 
filled with not only our own people, but with many friends and in- 
vestigators. In many places we were favored with the presence of 



58 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



lawyers, judges, business and professional men ; indeed men of af- 
fairs in these respective places came out to hear Apostle Smoot. 
The good that he accomplished in the Northwest I am sure cannot 
be estimated. The reactions since his visit have been fine and splen- 
did. We appreciate very much the wonderful amount of work that 
he did. 

We have found since going into that fine and delightful coun- 
try a warmth among the people. They are responsive. They like 
to visit with you. Their prejudices, if they ever had any, have 
vanished. As a result, we are invited into the homes of many people, 
unfolding to them the Gospel message as revealed ,in these the 
last days. As a result, many are coming into the Church, many 
are investigating, many friends are being made, and we are very 
happy in the prospects ahead. 

We have a small but very intelligent group of missionaries. I 
bring from them their love and appreciation to their fathers and 
mothers who are keeping them in the mission field. They are well 
physically, mentally and spiritually, and are doing their very best 
to promote, teach and preach the principles of the Gospel of our 
Lord and Master, Jesus Christ. It is fine to be associated with 
them, to feel of their spirit, to witness their determination in .their 
labors, and to see the development that is taking place from time 
to time in their lives. They are laboring in a delightful and beau- 
tiful country. 

There is nothing in life, my dear brethren and sisters, that 
gives us so much pleasure as bearing witness to this great and 
mighty work, not only at home, but in the nations of the earth. I 
have thought that to have a testimony concerning the divinity of this 
work is the greatest thing that can come to any Latter-day Saint. 
Our testimonies increase and grow because of our service, because 
of our faith and the quality of prayer that we offer up to God, our 
Eternal Father, day by day. We are dealing with divine truth, and 
the exercise of it brings freedom to our souls, also brings us in touch 
with our Father in heaven. 

Bancroft tells us : 

No truth can perish : No truth can pass away : The flame is undying though 
generations disappear. Whenever moral truth has struck into being, humanity 
claims and guards its greatest bequest. Each generation gathers together im- 
perishable children of the past and increases them by new sons of light alike radi- 
ant with immortality. 

Truth is one. It never contradicts itself. One truth cannot contradict another 
truth. Hence truth is the bond of union. But error not only contradicts truth but 
may contradict itself; so that there may be many errors and each at variance 
with the rest. Truth is therefore of necessity an element of harmony; error as 
necessarily an element of discord. 

The world can advance only through the culture and intellectual powers 
of the people. To accomplish this end by means of the people themselves is the 
highest purpose of government. If it be the duty of the individual to strive after 
a perfection like the perfection of God, how much more ought a nation to be the 
image of duty. 

If I interpret the Gospel of our Lord and Master, Jesus Christ, 



ELDER JOSEPH QUINNEY, JR. 



59 



correctly, we can advance only in our spiritual selves by adhering 
to those everlasting principles of truth that come to us through 
the Gospel of our Savior. He established the code for human be- 
havior which when built upon leads us into an everlasting under- 
standing of the saving graces of his divine Gospel. 

I desire, my dear brethren and sisters, to leave with you my 
humble testimony concerning the divinity of this great and mighty 
work. I know that God lives, I know that Jesus is the Christ, and 
that Joseph Smith was an instrumentality through which God op- 
erated in bringing to pass the restoration of the Gospel with all of 
its saving graces and powers. May he bless us with the spirit of 
appreciation for the great opportunities that are ours, and may we 
always deem it a high privilege to proclaim these truths whenever 
opportunity affords. May we uphold and sustain those who have 
been called to lead and direct us in this day and time. God bless 
them. May they have the light of wisdom and the power of his 
Holy Spirit to ever guide and direct his people, is my humble 
prayer and I ask it in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER LEGRAND RICHARDS 

President of the Southern States Mission 

I deem it a great honor, my brethren and sisters, to be priv- 
ileged to preside in the Southern States Mission of this Church. 
One of the greatest opportunities, I think, that could come to any 
man or woman is the association of the fine young men and women 
who are sent out from your homes to represent this Church in 
teaching the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. I know it is pleasing 
to the Church and pleasing to the parents to know that these boys 
and girls are not only teaching the Gospel by precept, but by ex- 
ample. They are worthy to go and cry repentance to the world, 
because they are sweet and clean, noble young people. I rejoice 
every day in the privilege of their association, and feel that I am 
becoming a better man because of it. 

Roger W. Babson says that statistics show that the greatest 
undeveloped resources in America are not our mines or our forests 
or our streams, but rather the human souls of our men and women. 
I am sure there is no place where the development of human souls 
is more rapid than in the mission field. I am grateful for the won- 
derful contribution made by the auxiliary organizations of this 
Church in preparing our youth for the responsibilities of the mis- 
sion field, so that when they arrive they grow rapidly. 

I was impressed with the statement made by Dr. Widtsoe 
yesterday, wherein he referred to the fundamentals of this Church 
that have stood the test for a hundred years and over, and have not 
been changed. When our boys arrive in the mission field, and go 
out to compare our teachings with the teachings of other people, 
they find an unsettled condition. Men's minds are unsettled with 
respect to the philosophies of life and with respect to religious

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



teachings. Our missionaries soon detect it. We have many men in 
the Southern States who are ministers of the Gospel, who are in- 
terested in the teachings of our missionaries. We had the privilege, 
a few weeks ago, of baptizing one of them with his wife and eldest 
son, and he was delighted with the wonderful truths he found at 
the hands of our missionaries. 

We baptized a young woman a few weeks ago whose father 
is an ordained minister of the Gospel, and we baptized her. with 
the consent of her father. The missionaries are now visiting him 
regularly in his home and teaching him the truth, and he marvels 
at the wonderful interpretation they give of the scriptures. 

In a group of missionaries that arrived a few weeks ago one 
young man seemed to be a little perturbed. I took him apart from 
the other missionaries and asked him what he thought of the 
Gospel ; if there was anything about it he did not understand, and 
he expressed his doubt on a few points of doctrine. After attempt- 
ing to clarify his mind I gave him a fine companion and sent him 
into the mission field. In about two weeks I received a marvelous 
letter from him. He said : "President Richards, I have been here 
long enough to find out the Gospel is true." 

I want to bear testimony to you, my brethren and sisters, that 
these boys and girls are teaching the Gospel by example. An 
article appeared in the July issue of the American Magazine, called 
"Kingdom in the Desert." Many of you may have read it. There 
are some very erroneous statements made in that article, but not- 
withstanding this fact, the writer did acknowledge that in his in- 
vestigation here in Salt Lake City he had found that there was one 
standard of morality, both among the business men and men of 
the shops. One of our very dear friends in Atlanta, Georgia, wrote 
an answer to that article. I would like to read two paragraphs of 
her letter. She said : 

I am a Presbyterian in good and regular standing, strong in the faith, but it 
has been my privilege to know well, over a period of twelve years, the many 
young missionaries of the Mormon faith who have passed through the Southern 
States Mission home at Atlanta. 

If there are any young people today who know where they are going, it is the 
Mormon young people. Brought up to seek education, to love music and the fine 
arts, to do without stimulants of any kind, and to lead clean lives, they have the 
foundation for useful and happy homes, and are certainly not proceeding under 
the momentum supplied by Brigham Young. 

I feel sure this woman was sincere in her statements, because 
she told Sister Richards she wanted her girls to marry Mormon 
boys. Sister Richards said: "Well, the Mormon boys' mothers may 
want them to marry Mormon girls." 

She said, "Of course I would expect my girls to become Mor- 
mons. 

We had the privilege of meeting some fine business people in 
Birmingham, Alabama, recently, and holding a meeting with them, 
lnese people stood high in the business world, and also in their 



ELDER LeGRAND RICHARDS 



61 



own church. After our meeting one of the men beckoned to Sister 
Richards. He wanted to talk with her alone. He had with him that 
night in the meeting a beautiful young daughter and a son, both 
college students, and he asked Sister Richards this question : "What 
about the youth of your Church?" He said: "Have you any mar- 
ried children?" Sister Richards informed him that she had three 
married daughters. He said: "Did they marry Mormon mission- 
aries?" and she acknowledged that they did. He wanted to know 
if she could trust her daughters with these boys. Sister Richards 
said : "Why, those boys were as sweet and clean when they took 
my girls, as my girls were." He said : "I can not understand it." 
And by the way, he stood high in his own church. "I do not know 
a young man to whom I would trust my daughter." Sister Richards 
pointed to a young man standing in the corner, a young man 
twenty-one years of age, president of that district, his mission 
about completed, and she said : "There is a young man as sweet 
and clean as any girl that ever lived." He surveyed him from head 
to foot and said : "I believe it." 

I want to bear testimony in closing, my brethren and sisters, 
that these boys and girls are making an impression upon the world. 
I stood in one of the great railroad stations of the South a few 
months ago, and read some statistics which I think are more alarm- 
ing than all the statistics of finance that we are so greatly con- 
cerned about in this nation today, a statement made by the Bureau of 
Vital Statistics of the United States of America, to the effect that each 
year 770,000 boys reach their majority in the United States, and of that 
number 480,000, or over half of them, are either suffering from venereal 
diseases, or will do, during the course of their lifetime, — and that in this 
great Christian nation. 

No wonder our friend from Birmingham did not know where 
to find a young man to whom he could trust his daughter. Then I 
realized something of the magnitude of the task before us, as stated 
by Mr. Babson, to whom I have referred, in developing the souls 
of America's men and women. I thank God for the Mormon 
boys and girls who have kept themselves sweet and clean, and I 
say : Who in all the world has a better right to cry,, as John the 
Revelator said they should do in the latter days : "Come out of her, 
my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that yt receive 
not of her plagues." Our boys and girls have the right to thus 
cry to this Babylon of today. 

God bless you my brethren and sisters, and your missionary 
boys and girls, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER FRANK I. KOOYMAN 

Former President of the Netherlands Mission 

It certainly is an inspiration, my brethren and sisters, to be here 
with you in conference, and to enjoy the wonderful spirit that is present. 
I was thrilled this morning when I heard President Grant announce 



62 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



that Brother Alonzo A. Hinckley, who many years ago labored in Hol- 
land where I have been presiding for the past four -and a half years, had 
been chosen as one of the Twelve. It was Alonzo A. Hinckley who took 
me into the water and baptized me. I have always looked upon him as 
a real servant of God. When I was in his presence I could understand 
why it was that people testified about the Prophet Joseph and President 
Brigham Young and others, that no matter how much these men were 
slandered, if they could only come into their presence, could feel what 
kind of men they were, all ill feelings would leave them. I have the very 
tenderest spot in my heart for Brother Alonzo A. Hinckley, and I thank 
my Father in heaven for the joy that his service brought to me. I know 
his appointment is by inspiration. 

I have very much enjoyed my labors in Holland. It has been a 
pleasure to try to follow the instructions that were given to us by Pres- 
ident John A. Widtsoe, who was in charge of the European Mission 
while I was there. What a joy it was to teach, especially our young peo- 
ple, through the labors of our auxiliary organizations. The people at 
large there did not seem to be very much impressed with our teachings, 
not very much interested, so we started to labor with our young people, 
to get them into uniform action with all the groups at home. 

What an inspiration it was to receive our young men, our young 
Elders, and train them to work with our local people there, to see them 
develop and take hold of the work, and to hear them sing the songs of 
Zion with the same spirit that we sing them here. 

And by the way, what would our M. I. A. leaders say should they 
be over there and attend a meeting of our young people, an inspiring 
meeting, when the one in charge of the congregation might lean over 
and ask : "What would you suggest we sing ?" 

They might say : "Let's sing 'Carry On.' " 

"Well, we haven't got it in our language." 

" 'True to the Faith,' then." 

"We haven't got it." 

" Tut your Shoulder to the Wheel.' " 

"Oh, no, we haven't got that translated yet, either." 

That was the condition. Then, if the Lord had blessed you, that you 
had, perhaps, a little ability to translate, you would try to put these songs 
into the other language. "Firm as the mountains around us" — what 
does the Hollander know about mountains? Not a thing. "And we 
hear the desert , singing" — they have never seen a desert. So, of course, 
we have our difficulties, but still, with the help of the Lord, we have 
been able to translate these songs, and now the Saints are singing them. 

Our young people are entering their tenth year of Mutual work, 
and they feel that same spirit, that same thrill that we feel when we sing 
"Carry On," when we sing, "True to the Faith," and "Put your Shoulder 
to the Wheel." 

I thank my Father in heaven for my contact with this great latter- 
day work, for my contact with men like Alonzo A. Hinckley and all of our 
leaders— President Heber J. Grant was presiding over the European 



ELDER FRANK I. KOOYMAN

Mission when I was on my first mission. Oh, I thank my Father in 
heaven that I stood next to that man as an interpreter and felt the power 
of God, for I was unable to talk English at that time. I was just study- 
ing the language and in the beginning I could not remember half of what 
President Grant said. Then some time later, when that beautiful inspira- 
tion, that power of God, descended upon both of us, there was the word 
of God,' an interpretation that couldn't be better. Thanks to our Father 
in heaven ! 

I thank the Lord for the opportunity I have had of laboring in 
the mission field, for the opportunity I have now of laboring among the 
people at home, of bearing testimony that God has spoken, that his 
servants are again upon the earth, that we have his Priesthood, that we 
have a living Church. 

May the Lord help us to realize our opportunities, to live such lives 
that his power and influence may be felt through us, I humbly pray, in 
the name of the Lord Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

I have been edified and made happy in the testimonies of my breth- 
ren, as they have been presented at the sessions of this conference. I in- 
dorse all that has been said. I have been in somewhat of a conflict in my 
own mind, feeling that I would be called on, to know just what I should 
say, because so many things have been presented and could be enlarged 
upon. 

THE REVEALED WORD OF THE LORD 

I shall read a passage from the Pearl of Great Price, where the Lord 
says : 

And whoso treasureth up my word shall not be deceived. 

I have been pleading for years with the members of the Church, 
as I have traveled up and down through the stakes of Zion, to get them 
to read the scriptures. I am of the opinion that there are a great many 
members of this Church who would be offended if any one should say 
that they were not in good standing, and yet they are not familiar with the 
revealed word of the Lord. 

I know of no time in the history of this Church, of no time in the 
history of the world, when it has been more important or necessary for 
the people to know the will of God, and to make themselves acquainted 
with that which he has revealed. 

TO ESTABLISH TRUTH OF SCRIPTURES 

In the revelations given to this Church through the Prophet Joseph 
Smith we are informed that the Book of Mormon came forth for the 
purpose of establishing the truth of the Jewish scriptures, in the hearts 
of the people. In a revelation that was given at the time the Church 



64 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



was organized the Lord said, speaking of the coming forth of the Book 
of Mormon and the mission of the Prophet in translating it : 

God administered unto him by an holy angel, whose countenance was as light- 
ning, and whose garments were pure and white above all other whiteness; 

And gave him power from on high, by the means which were before prepared, 
to translate the Book of Mormon; 

Which contains a record of a fallen people, and the fulness of the gospel of 
Jesus Christ to the Gentiles and to the Jew also ; 

Which was given by inspiration, and is confirmed to others by the ministering 
of angels, and is declared unto the world by them — 

Proving to the world that the holy scriptures are true, and that God does 
inspire men and call them to his holy work in this age and generation, as well 
as in generations of old. 

LACK OF FAITH IN CHRIST^ MISSION 

It is a sad thing, but true, that the world today, the so-called Chris- 
tian world, does not stand fundamentally upon the mission of Jesus 
Christ and the revealed word of God. I grant you there are, scattered 
among those who profess the Christian faith, many who do have faith and 
do acknowledge Christ as the Son of God, but the tendency of the times 
is against it. The teachings of our day are against it. The theories of 
men are against it. I think I know what I am speaking about, because 
I have studied them. 

IN CONFLICT WITH GOD's WORD 

Any theory that presents as a fact a statement that man has evolved 
from other forms, and has not always been a sentient being, capable of 
thought, of reasoning, is in conflict with the word of the Lord, as has 
been pointed out already by Elder Taylor in his remarks here yesterday. 
Any doctrine that presents a view contrary to that which has been given 
by revelation, that Adam was placed in the Garden of Eden, that by 
violation of the law he brought death into the world, and through that 
death sin and all the vicissitudes of mortality have come, — such a doc- 
trine is in conflict with the revealed word of God. 

Any doctrine that declares that man has always been a fallen cre- 
ature, or in other words, subject to the mortal conditions as we find 
them today, strikes at the vitals of the Christian faith. Any doctrine 
that will say there was no Garden of Eden, no need of Adam, no fall, 
no transgression by our first parents, also teaches that there is no 
redemption from the fall and that the need of Jesus Christ as the Re- 
deemer is unnecessary. If there had been no fall there would have been 
no redemption ; there would have been no need of Jesus Christ coming, 
as he declared he did come, and as it has been declared by the prophets, 
to repair a broken law and to restore again that which was lost and to 
redeem men from the fallen condition. I think what I say is logical, 
reasonable, and above all, it is scriptural. 

BEARS TESTIMONY OF CHRIST AND HIS MISSION 

I believe in Jesus Christ as the Son of God and the only begotten 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 65 



Son of the Father in the flesh ; that he came into the world as the Re- 
deemer, as the Savior ; and through his death, through his ministry, the 
shedding of his blood, he has brought to pass redemption from death 
to all men, to all creatures — not alone to man, but to every living thing, 
and even to this earth itself, upon which we stand, for we are informed 
through the revelations that it too shall receive the resurrection and come 
forth to be crowned as a celestial body, and to be the abode of celestial 
- beings eternally. 

I believe in Jesus Christ as the Savior of all men who are willing 
to repent and receive the Gospel, and not the Savior to any others, in the 
sense that he will give unto them an exaltation and bring them back again 
into the presence of God the Father. Yet he is the Savior of all men 
and will bless every creature, every soul, as far as he is able to bless, ac- 
cording to their works. 

JOSEPH SMITH AND HIS WORK 

I know that Joseph Smith was called of God ; that he, as the instru- 
ment in the hands of the Lord, introduced again to the world the Gospel 
of Jesus Christ, and by the power of God established anew the Church 
of Jesus Christ in all the world, now called "of Latter-day Saints," to dis- 
tinguish it from the church of former-day Saints. This is my testimony. 
There isn't time, of course, to enlarge upon these things, but I know this is 
true. I know this is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and 
these men who are called to stand at the head do have the inspiration and 
the guidance of the Holy Spirit which is upon them. 

THAT WE MAY WALK IN THE TRUTH 

And I do know that it is a requirement that is made of us, as mem- 
bers of this Church, to make ourselves familiar with that which the 
Lord has revealed, that we may not be led astray, for the Lord has said 
there are many spirits abroad in the land ; some of them are the spirits of 
men, some are the spirits of devils ; but he has given unto us his Spirit, if 
we will receive it, and that Spirit leads and directs in all truth. How are 
we going to walk in the truth if we do not know it ? 

I bear this testimony. May the Lord bless us, guide and protect us, 
I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER OLIVER H. BUDGE 

Former President of the G erman- Austrian Mission 

My dear brethren and sisters and good friends of the Church, I am 
indeed pleased, after an absence of more than four years, to have the 
privilege of attending this one hundred and fifth semi-annual conference 
of the Church of our Lord, and to again be able to associate myself with 
the leading brethren of the Church, as well as with all those in conference 
assembled. 

In reporting the German- Austrian Mission may I say that the work 
of the Lord in that part of his vineyard is progressing, and that the Saints 



66 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



are rejoicing in the blessings of the Gospel. I bring greetings to you 
from all of the missionaries and from approximately eight thousand 
members. The German Saints express the hope that the Latter-day 
Saints here in Zion are appreciating their membership in the Church, 
and that they are true and faithful to the covenants they have made with 
God. 

Upon my arrival in the German- Austrian Mission in October, 1930, 
I discovered that the financial condition of the mission was anything 
but desirable, but with the help of the Lord, the missionaries, the breth- 
ren of the Priesthood, and the Saints generally, we were in a position, 
by July, 1932, to pay all of our indebtedness in the mission, in the vari- 
ous districts, in the branches and in the organizations of the branches ; 
and from that day to this we have been able to meet our obligations 
promptly. 

The auxiliary organizations in the mission are fully organized, with 
a board for each. Each organization has sufficient means to pay for its 
traveling expenses, its circulars, stationery and the like. Since July, 
1932, no auxiliary organization has had as much as one mark from the 
general fund of the mission. The mission is now in a very healthy condi- 
tion, financially and spiritually. 

When I arrived in the mission all of the districts were presided over 
by missionaries from home. Today all of the districts are presided over 
by local brethren of the Priesthood. Thirty per cent of the branches 
were then in the hands of local brethren. Today ninety-seven per cent 
of the branches are presided over by them. In other words, out of 
seventy-seven branches all are presided over by local brethren except 
three. 

I am thoroughly converted to the idea of turning the responsibilities 
of the mission over to local brethren and sisters. They are just as 
capable, just as intelligent, and just as able to conduct the affairs as we, if 
they are properly taught. As with the Priesthood, so with the Saints. 
I think that our work should be taken up principally with the Priest- 
hood ; teaching them proper principles, and why this, that and the other is 
done, and how to do it. They will take care of the rest. 

Upon my arrival there were a hundred and sixty-two missionaries in 
the German-Austrian Mission, and let me say to you this afternoon that, 
with a very few exceptions, I think the Church has never produced bet- 
ter young men than we have had and still have in that mission. They 
are clean and sweet in their habits. They are obedient and humble. 
If we have made any progress worth the mentioning, I desire that the 
credit be equally divided with these missionaries. 

We had the misfortune, during my time, to lose two missionaries in 
the field, Elder Arthur Wright and Elder Dale Read, of Ogden. Both 
of these men came into the mission field with the proper spirit and with 
a determination to serve God, and God only. It was not possible, how- 
ever, for them to devote very much of their time to the work. God'willed 
it otherwise. Elder Melvin A. Ashton, another good missionary, died in 
this city soon after his return home. Brother Melvin Ashton was also 



ELDER OLIVER H. BUDGE 



67 



one of God's choice spirits. He was the secretary of the mission. I tell 
you, my brethren and sisters, that when we witnessed the suffering of 
these men, and finally their death, our heart-strings were pulled, because 
we loved them almost as we love our own sons. 

Sister Budge was of great assistance in the mission, and accom- 
plished much with the Relief Society, the young women, and the Primary 
organization. There had been little or nothing done in Primary work 
up to the time of our arrival. Sister Budge, with her assistants, succeeded 
in enrolling at one time fifteen hundred children in the Primary work. 
Fifty to sixty per cent of these children's parents are non-members of 
the Church. The Primaries were regular and neighborhood Primaries. 
I would that Sister Budge could explain to you just how the work was 
conducted and just how much in this regard was accomplished. 

I am grateful to the leading brethren of the Church for the oppor- 
tunity I have had of filling a mission in that part of the Lord's vineyard. 
I desire to say that the Church owes me nothing. I shall never live long 
enough to repay the Church for what it has done for me. I desire to 
continue to be humble and obedient. The Authorities of the Church 
have never had occasion to ask me if I were willing to do this or that or the 
other ; all they had to do was to tell me to do it. 

I know that the Gospel is true. I know that God lives, that Jesus 
is the Christ, and that the Holy Ghost will lead and direct us in all 
righteousness, if we put ourselves in a position to be led by him. May we 
all so live that we shall be able to say, although the world is full of devils 
who seek to overthrow us, we fear not, for in the end we shall win. Amen. 

The congregation sang the hymn, "Do what is right," after which 
the benediction was pronounced by Elder Henry D. Moyle, President 
of the Cottonwood Stake. 

SECOND DAY 
AFTERNOON MEETING 

Conference reconvened at 2 o'clock Saturday afternoon. 

President Grant announced that the congregation would join in 
singing the hymn, "Prayer is the soul's sincere desire." 

After the singing of this hymn, Elder Heber J. Burgon, President 
of the East Jordan Stake, offered the invocation. 

Sister Bessie Morley sang a sacred solo, "To every heart." 

ELDER REED SMOOT 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

I do not think that I ever attended a General Conference of the 
Church when I have felt a greater portion of the Spirit of the Lord 
and when I have been more in accord with the statements made by those 



68 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



who spoke. There is an echo in my heart to all that has been said, and I 
am quite sure that everyone present has that same feeling of loyalty to 
the Church. 

CHARGES IN SMOOT INVESTIGATION 

I picked up volume three of the "Investigation of Reed Smoot," and 
it opened to page 593. I read these words, which are part of the charges 
made against me by Mr. Tayler, the prosecuting attorney, I may term 
him, at that time : 

Several hundred thousand sincere men and women have believed and now 
believe, as they believe in their own existence, that Joseph Smith, Jr. received 
revelations direct from God, and if anyone ever believed that we must assume that 
Senator Smoot believes it. 

Now a Senator of the United States might believe anything else in the world 
but that and not be ineligible to a seat in the body to which he belongs. He might 
believe in polygamy ; he might believe that murder was commendable ; he might 
deny the propriety as a rule of life of all the ten commandments ; he might believe 
in the sacrifice of human life ; he might believe in no God or in a thousand gods ; 
he might be Jew or Gentile, Mohammedan or Buddhist, atheist or pantheist ; he 
might believe that the world began last year and would end next year, but to 
believe with the kind of conviction that Reed Smoot possesses that God speaks 
to him or may speak to him is to admit by the inevitable logic of his conviction 
that there is a superior authority with whom here and now he may converse, and 
whose command he can no more refuse to obey than he can will himself not to 
think. 

FAITH IN GOD AND HIS REVELATIONS 

My brethren and sisters, in my answer to the charges of Mr. Tayler, 
do you think for a moment that I would admit that I was not to be a 
Senator because I believed in a living God; because I believed that 
Joseph Smith was a prophet of the living God, establishing God's work 
here upon this earth in this dispensation ? No. I wanted every Senator 
and every person in all the world, if it were possible, to understand that 
the charge that was made against me upon that occasion I agreed was 
correct as far as my belief in receiving revelations from God, or that 
Joseph Smith was a prophet of the living God. I never want to live long 
enough that that testimony shall not be burning in my soul. Rather 
would I die than have such a thing happen to me. I know that he was 
a prophet of God. I know that God and his Son Jesus Christ appeared 
to him. I know that this is the work of God, and just as sure as we live 
the world will acknowledge it some time or other. 

TRIBUTE TO THE CHOIR 

I received a letter the other day, and while I have listened to the 
choir and know what a wonderful agency it has been to allay the preju- 
dices of the people against the Church, I would like to read this letter to 
you. It is from 370 Seventh Avenue, New York, and dated August 
26th, 1934: 

For more than a year I have promised myself that I would do what I am 
now doing, to express to you as one of the heads of the Mormon Church our 



ELDER REED SMOOT 



69 



appreciation for the wonderful contribution you folks are making in your Sunday 
presentation of the Mormon choir. 

Vacationing down along the coast during August, eight of us, including our 
organist and director, piled into one car to listen to your choir. The owner of 
that car took out an old radio set and put in a new one because he was warned in 
advance that nothing was to interfere on Sundays at twelve with listening to the 
Mormon Choir. 

I wonder if the members of your Choir realize the sheer, unalloyed joy their 
music is bringing to so many people ! I wonder if Richard Evans realizes how 
gracious and fitting are his announcements and how truly, coupled with the music, 
they do bring peace through the week ! I wonder if Frank Asper realizes that, 
not deprecating the work of a guest organist, we would rather hear him play. I 
wonder if those who pay the bills realize the great gift they are making. 

This letter is not from a gusher or a publicity seeker. We have tasted the 
emptiness of the gusher's words. We don't need any publicity. But when the 
Mormon Choir can make such heathens of Methodist singers, who love to sing, 
that they stay home to listen, what truer tribute could there be? 

Can't someone send us a copy of your Choir's theme song, just one copy, 
words and music? And might we use it in our opening service? If so, we will be 
singing with you. I do not mean for regular use or for broadcasting but just 
occasionally when we must miss your choir. I hope you can read this scribbling, 
but if left until tomorrow to be typed in the office it will be passed by as it has 
been for a year and this "thank you" has waited long enough. 

What nicer tribute could any man pay to our choir than this ? 

WORDS OF ORSON HYDE 

I believe in revelation as every Latter-day Saint must. I picked 
up an old History of the Church the other day and I found these words, 
which I endorse with all my heart. They are from an address made on 
April 6th, 1840, at Nauvoo, by Orson Hyde, one of the great men of 
this Church, one of the pillars of the Church in its early days, one who 
traveled in Europe, in parts of the great countries of Europe, early in the 
forties. I read this from his journal : 

On Sunday morning, October 24, 1841, a good while before day, I arose from 
sleep and went out of the city (Jerusalem) as socn as the gates were opened, 
crossed the brook Kedron and went upon the Mount of Olives and there in solemn 
silence, with pen and ink and paper, just as I saw in the vision, offered up the 
following prayer to Him who lives forever and ever. 

LAND OF PALESTINE BLESSED 

I quote one or two paragraphs only from that lengthy prayer: 

Grant, therefore, O Lord, in the name of thy well beloved Son, Jesus Christ, 
to remove the barrenness and sterility of this land, and let springs of living water 
break forth to water its thirsty soil. Let the vine and olive produce in theic 
strength, and the fig tree bloom and flourish. Let the land become abundantly 
fruitful when possessed by its rightful heirs ; let it again flow with plenty to feed 
the returning prodigals who come home with a spirit of grace and supplication; 
upon it let the clouds distil virtue and richness, and let the fields smile with plenty. 
Let the flocks and the herds greatly increase and multiply upon the mountains and 
the hills ; and let Thy great kindness conquer and subdue the unbelief of Thy people. 
Do thou take from them their stony heart, and give them a heart of flesh ; and may 
the sun of Thy favor dispel the cold mists of darkness which have beclouded their 



70 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



atmosphere. Incline them to gather in upon this land according to Thy word. Let 
them come like clouds and like doves to their windows. Let the large ships of 
the nations bring them from the distant isles ; and let kings become their nursing 
fathers, and queens with motherly fondness wipe the tears of sorrow from their 

Let the nation or that people, who shall take an active part in behalf of Abra- 
ham's children, and in the rising up of Jerusalem, find favor in Thy sight. Let 
not their enemies prevail against them, neither let pestilence nor famine overcome 
them, but let the glory of Israel overshadow them, and the power of the Highest 
protect them ; while that nation or kingdom that will not serve Thee in this 
glorious work must perish, according to Thy word — "Yea, those nations shall be 
utterly wasted." 

He then states : 

It was by political power and influence that the Jewish nation was broken 
down, and her subjects dispersed abroad. And I will here hazard the opinion that 
by political power and influence they will be gathered and built up ; and further, 
that England is destined, in the wisdom and economy of heaven, to stretch forth 
the arm of political power, and advance in the front ranks of this glorious 
enterprise. 

PROPHECY FULFILLED 

Now let us see if that has been fulfilled. On November 5th, 1914, 
England declared war against Turkey. General Allenby, in command of 
an army of English soldiers, began his triumphant march to recover the 
Holy Land, driving the Turks before him and destroying their power of 
conquest and possession forever. He captured Gaza on November 7, 
1917; Jerusalem, December 9, 1917; Nazareth, September 22, 1918; 
Damascus, October 1, 1918; and proceeded to Aleppo October 26, thus 
sweeping Palestine from Beersheba to Dan. This campaign was mar- 
velous in many ways. It was led by an Englishman who is reported to 
be a man of faith and prayer. The favor of the Lord was made manifest 
in the comparative ease with which it was accomplished and in the few 
casualties of the English. The Turks were completely defeated and the 
surrender of the Turkish Empire followed October 30th, 1918. 

INSPIRED UTTERANCES 

My brethren and sisters, for the last few months I have been read- 
ing the old prophecies as recorded in our Millennial Star, and it seems 
to me that no human being could read them and know the history and 
look at it as it is today without acknowledging that those men were in- 
spired of the living God, and spoke as they were inspired to speak by a 
higher power than man. 

I wanted to call attention to that, my brethren and sisters, for I think 
sometimes we who are living in this material world are so busy working 
hours and hours into the night— and I was going to say that ninety-five 
per cent of us have but one goal in view, and that is gathering to our- 
selves the things of this world. Most of these ninety-five per cent think 
of God but a few hours perhaps once a week. 

WORK OF GOD 

So, my brethren and sisters, I want to testify to you that I know that 



ELDER REED SMOOT 



71 



this is the work of God. I know that all that has been promised will be 
given if we but fulfil the requirements made by the Father. May 
God's blessings ever attend you in your every-day life. May his choicest 
blessings be upon the brethren who have been appointed to responsible 
positions in the Church this day. I know them, I know that our Heavenly 
Father knows them. I know they are worthy, and I am sure that God 
will be with them, and they shall have influence wherever they go, not 
only among our own people, but among the peoples of the world with 
whom they come in contact. 

PRAYS FOR PRESIDENT GRANT 

Father in heaven, bless President Grant. Thou knowest his labors 
and his devotion to thy cause. May he be beloved by all men for his great- 
ness and his goodness and his love for thy cause, and may I ask the same 
prayer, the same blessing upon every man who is serving God in any 
way. May his Church grow and increase. No matter how soon the day 
comes when the world shall end may we all be prepared for the salvation 
of the children of men, I ask in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

We have sung this afternoon that beautiful hymn, "Prayer is 
the Soul's Sincere Desire." With the Latter-day Saints, prayer is 
a sacred form of worship. We are all taught to observe prayers — 
in secret, prayers in the family, prayers in our public worship. The 
prayer of an honest, faithful man availeth much with the Lord. 
Prayers of many faithful men and women, centered upon the same 
object and purpose, must avail much more -with the Lord. 

INSPIRED APPOINTMENTS 

I have prayed earnestly that the President of the Church would 
be inspired of the Lord in the selection of men to fill the vacancies 
in the councils of the General Authorities. No doubt you, my breth- 
ren and sisters, have prayed just as earnestly. Our prayers have 
been answered and our souls are made to rejoice in the selections 
that have been made. With all my heart I sustain each one of these 
brethren, and thank the Lord for them, as I sustain and thank the 
Lord for those who were already members of these councils, all of 
whom I know to be men of God, who are devoted to the work of 
the Lord, and who are willing to do anything that they may be 
called upon to do, always acknowledging those in authority who 
may make these appointments from time to time as being the Lord's 
representatives, they having authority to speak and act for the Lord. 

In responding to such calls to the ministry we answer the call 
of the Lord to engage in his work, and when thus engaged we are 
performing the greatest service that it is possible for a person to 
give to God and to his fellow men.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



THANKFUL FOR RESTORED HEALTH 

I rejoice in being here today. Six months ago I had a lameness, 
an illness, which prevented my attending the General Conference. 
The prayers of the Saints have been offered in my behalf; the bless- 
ings of the Lord have come to me and effected my recovery so that 
I am able now to carry on my work. I praise and thank the Lord, 
and thank the Saints for their faith and prayers in my behalf. 

Believing that I have your confidence, your love and faith, I 
desire to say something pertaining to this Gospel that we have re- 
ceived, which is of more worth than anything or everything else 
with which we have to do. 

THE GOSPEL WHAT IT IS 

We read in the Scriptures a definition of the Gospel given by 
the Apostle Paul to the Romans wherein he says: "I am not 
ashamed of the Gospel of Christ : for it is the power of God unto 
salvation." To enlarge a little upon that definition, we might say 
that the Gospel is the plan of the Gods in the councils of heaven 
before the world was, for the existence of this earth upon which we 
live and of man upon the earth, for the fall of man, for the redemp- 
tion of man, and his exaltation through the atoning blood of Jesus 
Christ and obedience unto the laws and ordinances of the Gospel, 
and for the glorification of the earth. This plan involves also the 
acceptance of certain principles, the receiving of certain ordinances, 
the keeping of the commandments of the Lord, obeying his laws, 
rendering service to the Church, service to the Lord, service to fel- 
low men, public service and private service, financial aid and spirit- 
ual blessing, and whatever else can be done for the blessing of man- 
kind. 

MUST BE TAUGHT THE LAW 

The Gospel requires the keeping of oneself free and unspotted 
from the sins of the world, and the living of a God-like and Christ- 
like life. It is the law by which all mankind are to be judged, and 
by which they are to be condemned or justified, according to merit. 
The scriptures tell us that until the law, sin was in the world, but 
sin is not imputed where there is no law. 

VVe read in the Book of Mormon also that where there is no 
law given there is no condemnation. Therefore, in justice, the law 
of the Gospel must be taught unto all men. No man can be judged 
by that law until it is taught to him and to his understanding. 

There are but few people, comparatively, who have had the Gos- 
pel in its fulness and simplicity taught to them so that they could 
conscientiously receive it, — very few of the teeming millions of our 
Father's children who have lived upon this earth down to the pres- 
ent time. 

MUST BE BORN AGAIN 

What is going to become of those who have not subscribed to 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 



73 



these conditions? The Savior said to Nicodemus, a ruler of the 
Jews : "Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom 
of God." Also he said: "Except a man be born of water and of 
the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.'' The ex- 
pression, "being born again," Nicodemus could not understand. 
There are many people today who do not understand this "birth,'' 
but we have an explanation in the vision of Moses contained in the 
Pearl of Great Price, which makes plain the meaning of this Scrip- 
ture. For the benefit of those who have not understood it let me 
read a few paragraphs : 

Therefore I give unto you a commandment, to teach these things freely unto 
your children saying : ' 

That by reason of transgression cometh the fall, which fall bringeth death, and 
inasmuch as ye were born into the world by water, and blood, and the spirit, which 
I have made, and so became of dust a living soul, even so ye must be born again 
into the kingdom of heaven, of water, and of the Spirit, and be cleansed by blood 
even the blood of; mine Only Begotten; that ye might be sanctified from all sin, 
and enjoy the words of eternal life in this world, and eternal life in the world 
to come, even immortal glory; 

For by the water ye keep the commandment ; by the Spirit ye are justified, and 
by the blood ye are sanctified. 

THE ONLY TRUE MODE OF BAPTISM 

Does "being born again" mean a sprinkling of water? Hardly 
Let me read further from the Book of Moses : 

And it came to pass, when the Lord had spoken with Adam, our father, that 
Adam cried unto the Lord, and he was caught away by the Spirit of the Lord, 
and was carried down into the water, and was laid under the water, and was 
brought forth out of the water. 

And thus he was baptized, and the Spirit of God descended upon him, and 
thus he was born of the Spirit, and became quickened in the inner man. 

And he heard a voice out of heaven, saying : Thou art baptized with fire, and 
with the Holy Ghost. This is the record of the Father, and the Son, from hence- 
forth and forever. 

Herein is described the mode of baptism originating with Adam, 
the first man. God has never authorized any other kind of baptism 
by water. And baptism by water is not complete until the individ- 
ual has been baptized by fire, or the Holy Ghost, or, in other words, 
has had hands laid upon his head for confirmation to membership 
in the Church of Christ and the bestowal of the Holy Ghost, as was 
the order of things in the Primitive Church. 

BY ONE HAVING AUTHORITY 

I shall read from the 20th section of the Doctrine and Cove- 
nants, verses 73-74: 

The person who is called of God and has authority from Jesus Christ to baptize 
shall go down into the water with the person who has presented himself or 
herself for baptism and shall say, calling him or her by name : Having been 
commissioned of Jesus Christ, I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the 
Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen. 



74 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Then shall he immerse him or her in the water, and come forth again out of 
the water. 

Brethren and sisters, observe that the person baptizing must 
be "called of God" and have "authority from Jesus Christ" to per- 
form this sacred ordinance; for no other authorization is accepted 
of God. Note also that the officiator and the applicant for baptism 
are to "go down into the water," which, obviously, does not con- 
template or justify baptizing in a bath tub, with the baptizer stand- 
ing outside of the tub. 

There is no justification in any of the scriptures, ancient or 
modern, for any other mode of baptism ; and the ordinance must be 
administered by one having authority. 

CONDITIONS PRESCRIBED 

In the 20th section of the Doctrine and Covenants, we have the 
direct word of the Lord in regard to this principle of baptism, verse 
71: 

No one can be received into the Church of Christ unless he has arrived unto 
the years of accountability before God, and is capable of repentance. 

This means that baptism is not necessary for little children who 
are not capable of repenting. The Lord has informed us by rev- 
elation that the normal child eight years of age is to be regarded as 
being accountable, and therefore should be baptized. 

The Lord has said concerning the qualifications necessary to 
receive this ordinance, Doctrine and Covenants, section 20, verse 
37: 

All those who humble themselves before God, and desire to be baptized, and 
come forth with broken hearts and contrite spirits, and witness before the Church 
that they have truly repented of all their sins, and are willing to take upon them the 
name of Jesus Christ, having a determination to serve him to the end, and truly 
manifest by their works that they have received of the Spirit of Christ unto the 
remission of their sins, shall be received by baptism into his church. 

Mankind everywhere must subscribe to these conditions. There 
are no other conditions prescribed by the Lord by which we may 
obtain entrance into his kingdom and obtain salvation. These re- 
quirements are very plain, simple, and easy to be understood. 

What we may read in the Pearl of Great Price, and in all of 
the other standard Church works regarding these principles and or- 
dinances is a confirmation and a making plain of the statements 
which are set forth in the King James translation of the Bible — the 
Old and the New Testaments. 

"judged according to men in the flesh" 

Now what are we going to do with these teeming millions who 
have not entered the Church and Kingdom of God by receiving this 
sacred ordinance and other sacred ordinances which are just as 
necessary for man's exaltation as are baptism and confirmation, and 
which men and women must receive ? Those who have not had the 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 



75 



privilege of hearing the Gospel in this life will have the privilege of 
hearing it hereafter. Otherwise they could not be judged by the 
Gospel law. Hence we read in the scriptures : 

For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that 
they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God 
in the spirit. 

Peter says : 

For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he 
might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the spirit : 
By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison. 

A VICARIOUS WORK 

So that the preaching of the Gospel to the spirits in the spirit 
world is not a new doctrine ; it is a Bible doctrine. But what are 
they going to do when the Gospel is preached unto them and they 
become converted, if baptism is necessary and they have not been 
baptized? The Lord has made this provision, that a vicarious work 
may .be done for them ; and he has laid the responsibility directly 
upon the members of this Church, who have received these sacred 
ordinances, to officiate for their kindred dead. 

We have no right to go into other people's lines to do temple 
work without permission from them. We may receive or give 
assistance in temple work, either gratuitous or paid-for service. 
President Wilford Woodruff received gratuitous assistance from a 
number of the Saints in doing his temple work in the St. George 
Temple. President Heber J. Grant has set the Church a wonder- 
ful example in this respect, both by going to the Temple himself 
and by taking his family with him to do ordinance work, and also 
by employing additional help in order to discharge the sacred duty 
resting upon him pertaining to his kindred. 

SAVING OUR DEAD 

The Lord has said, through the Prophet Joseph Smith, that no 
greater responsibility has he placed upon us than that we look after 
our kindred dead. 

There are many faithful Saints who are out of employment. 
Why not spend some of our means in paying them to assist us in 
doing our temple work, and by so doing be a blessing to both the 
living and the dead? 

I desire here to make an appeal to the Latter-day Saints not 
to overlook this responsibility. We should awaken, go forth, and 
do our duty. God expects it of us. Saving the dead is just as im- 
portant as preaching the Gospel abroad and bringing the living into 
the fold. 

In the temple we are prepared to take care of the Saints, who 
may come at almost any hour of the day, — from early morning until 
late at night, as they have a few hours to spare, and surely their 
work outside of the temple ought not to take all of their time. 



76 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Come to the temple; redeem your dead; and be blessed. 
May God help you and me to this end I pray in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

At the request of President Grant the congregation arose and sang 
the hymn, "O say, what is truth ?" 

ELDER HOLGER M. LARSEN 

Former President of the Danish Mission 

I appreciate, my brethren and sisters, this opportunity of re- 
porting conditions in the far-oft' land of Denmark. It has been my 
good fortune, for the past five years, to labor as a missionary in 
the Danish Mission, and to endeavor to preach the Gospel unto that 
people. I want to tell you that the condition of the Danish Mission 
at the present time is very good. 

We may not have made very many converts during the past 
few years, but we have tried to teach the people how to take care 
of themselves. The call came to us through President John A. 
Widtsoe, of the General Authorities, at the time that I arrived in 
the field, to try to install local branch presidencies, to try to give 
all the responsibility we possibly could to the local brethren and 
sisters. We have tried to do that and the result has been most won- 
derful. 

The people of the Danish Mission have commenced to feel a 
greater interest in the Church, they have commenced to feel that 
they really belong to the Church ; they feel that there is something 
for them to do. Many of the missions had almost got into the same 
condition as is existing in the other churches — we had ministers to 
do almost everything for us. But when the local brethren and sis- 
ters learned that it was necessary for them to do something for 
themselves, they really appreciated their membership in the Church. 

Through the generosity of the brethren of the General Authori- 
ties at home we have been able to erect in the city of Copenhagen 
one of the finest chapels the Church has anywhere in Europe. It 
has been a great asset to the Church, inasmuch as we now have a 
beautiful building in which to meet. 

I want to tell you, brethren and sisters, that we have appre- 
ciated the missionaries that have come into the mission field from 
time to time. We have appreciated the brethren who have been 
sent to us, and we have tried to help them in every possible way. 
There is no better work, there is no work that will give a person 
more joy and more satisfaction than that of trying to bring souls 
unto God. 

The missionary life is the life that is giving joy and satisfac- 
tion to the membership of the Church. One of the stake presidents 
whom I met this morning told me that his stake had more mis- 
sionaries in the field than any other stake in the Church. I told 



ELDER HOLGER M. LARSEN 



77 



him I could see that that would be an asset to his stake. When we 
receive the good reports from the missionaries, when we receive 
their letters full of the spirit of the Gospel, full of the missionary 
spirit, we cannot help but try to live better lives. 

Although the Danish Mission is perhaps one of the smallest 
among the European group, we were the first mission in the Euro- 
pean group to install complete local boards for the different auxili- 
ary organizations. We are having the same kind of church in Den- 
mark at the present time as we have in the stakes of Zion. Although 
small in numbers, we try to carry on the same lessons and the same 
work that we have at home. The Elders who have been sent to 
us are splendid young men, and I would like to commend the 
parents who have sent their sons into the field; and I would also like 
to say to the fathers, that the crying need in the European missions at the 
present time, and particularly some of the missions where we have been 
accustomed to having middle-aged men, is that some of the fathers of 
these boys come into the field and do missionary work. 

Sometimes I am afraid we have grown into a condition where 
we are not depending upon our Heavenly Father as much as we 
used to do, we have not the faith we formerly had. We fear that 
he will not help us and bless us in doing missionary service. We 
would rather send our boys into the mission field. In many places 
some of the older brethren could do much more good. 

We are not complaining; we are grateful, and we are thankful 
for the young boys, but it would be a great help to the mission 
presidents to have some brethren a little older who could help 
steady these boys along. 

I want to testify to you of the truthfulness of the Gospel, and 
I want to tell you that the Lord has been merciful and has blessed 
us during the past five years in the missionary work in the Danish 
Mission. We are grateful for the degree of success that we have 
had, and we are willing to give the honor and the glory unto our 
Heavenly Father. It has been through his Spirit and through the 
united efforts of the missionaries who have labored in that field 
that we have been able to do anything to further this work. 

I want to testify to you that I know the Gospel is true ; had 
it not been for that testimony, I do not believe that anything could 
have persuaded me to go back to my native land and try to induce 
people to join the Mormon faith. 

I am grateful for this testimony. I am grateful more than 
words can express for my membership in this Church. I am grate- 
ful for the association I have had with you, my brethren and sisters. 
It is a pleasure to come back home and to attend the conference 
sessions. That is one thing that we very much miss when we are 
in the mission field. We can read the report of the conference, we 
can read of the talks that have been given, but it is not like asso- 
ciating with you brethren and sisters. 

I ask the Lord to bless the Presidency of this Church and 
every member of the Church. I want to testify to you that I know 



78 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



that our leaders are men of God, I know that they are working 
day and night in order to fulfil and magnify the calling which has 
been placed upon them. The Lord bless us all, I ask in the name 
of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER ARTHUR WELLING .... 
Former President of the North Central States Mission 

I am grateful, my brethen and sisters, for the opportunity of 
again joining in testimony that this is verily the Church and King- 
dom of God, and of making final report of my labors in the North 
Central States Mission, over which I have had the honor to preside 
during the last five years. 

I rejoice that I have membership in what I believe to be the 
most perfect instrument for individual development, mutual im- 
provement, social service and moral and spiritual welfare upon 
the earth today — The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints— 
whose maker and builder is God. 

I join and rejoice in the testimony that the mission field offers 
one of the richest of these opportunities for development. Mission- 
aries soon learn to rely upon the truth announced by Nephi that 
the Lord requires nothing of his servants but that he provides the 
means by which that which is required may be accomplished ; also 
the truth of the Savior's assurance that he that seeketh his life 
shall lose it ; but he that will lose his life for my sake shall find it." 
And so, realizing his dependence upon the Lord and his partnership 
with him in a great cause, he serves unselfishly and well himself 
and fellow men. 

The first time I was called to make this report five years ago 
it was near the end of the final session of the conference. As I ! 
waited a moment for my turn, that peerless leader and teacher, 
since gone to his reward, Dr. James E. Talmage, said impressively 
to me: "You used to be a student of mine. Don't waste any time 
explaining that the time is short." 

I have greatly appreciated that lesson and the spirit in which 
it was offered. The time is short, here, in the mission field, every- 
where. My five years in the field were all too brief, and I am glad 
now that I did not wait until the end to appreciate that fact. Travel- 
ing approximately forty to fifty thousand miles a year, over an 
area a thousand miles square, and holding not quite an average of 
one public meeting a day, but more than one every other day. I 
enjoyed every minute of it. The other missionaries were equally 
busy and happy in their work, and the Lord blessed our efforts ; and 
he blessed the people that they bore with patience our imperfec- 
tions, and we were all happy in service. But that is over ; and we 
return, "with glad heart and cheerful countenance," to the work 
awaiting us here, for which also I am grateful. 

I rejoice in the appointment of my successor, President Wil- 



ELDER ARTHUR WELLING

ford W. Richards, who now presides in the North Central States 
Mission. Already the people love him ; and I bespeak for him and 
them the further favor and blessing of the Lord in rich abundance. 

I am glad to find myself in complete harmony with the Spirit 
of divine guidance which is manifest in the selection of brethren 
to fill important vacancies at this conference, Presidents Clark and 
McKay, and Elders Hinckley and Hardy. I have always wor- 
shipped from afar the General Authorities of the Church ; and the better 
I get acquainted with them the more I love them. I know and bear 
record they are men of God. 

A final word of testimony I wish might reach the youth of 
Zion^ everywhere: I believe in God as our Father and in mankind 
as his children ; in the ultimate triumph of truth and righteous- 
ness ; and in prayer as a source of spiritual strength. I like a story 
one of the brethren tells about prayer : 

A little boy was going to bed without saying his prayers. 
"Haven't you forgotten something?" inquired his father. 

"No father, I haven't," said the boy. 

"Aren't you going to say your prayers?" 

"No. I've quit." 

"Quit?" 

"Yes, I've quit. You know father, you used to tell me, and 
mother did too, that if I would ask God for things I needed badly, 
he would answer my prayers and grant my requests ; but when 
mother was sick and I prayed that she might get well, God didn't 
hear nor answer our prayers, but took her away instead ; and so 
I don't see the use of praying any more, and I've quit." 

How would you have answered that little boy? 

Do we remember that one sad night the Son of God himself 
knelt in the garden of Gethsemane and prayed : "Father, if it be 
possible, let this cup pass." Was he answered? Did the cup of 
which he prayed pass? We know it did not. On the contrary, Son 
of God though he was, he drank and saved a world. 

But there was another part to the prayer he prayed in Geth- 
semane: "Nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done." Possibly 
the little boy did not know or had forgotten that part of the 
Savior's prayer, as likewise have too many of our Father's children, 
who, like the little boy, have "quit." 

The greatest need of the world today, I believe, is a dispo- 
sition to concur in that second half of the Master's prayer: "Thy 
will, O God, not mine, be done." 

To which humble report and testimony may the Lord add his 
blessings, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER WILLIAM R. SLOAN 

Former President of the Northwestern States Mission 

For seventeen successive conferences of the Church it has been 
my happy privilege to stand before a congregation such as this and give a 



80 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



report of the Northwestern States Mission, over which Sister Sloan and 
I had been called to preside. We were called to this responsibility on 
the 19th day of October, 1926. A few days later we were set apart, and 
the latter part of November I went to the mission and toured it with my 
predecessor, President Brigham S. Young. 

I am happy to say, in your presence that our life has been tremend- 
ously happy, and if you brethren and sisters, in your homes, have enjoyed 
life as much as my companion and I have done during the past thirty 
years, you have tasted a little of the joys of heaven, I am sure. We be- 
lieve that the heaven received in the hereafter will be commensurate with 
what we make it here, and the first place to establish those heavenly rela- 
tions, I believe, is in the home. 

Had it not been for the help of the Lord, the faith and prayers of 
my brethren, and the untiring support of my good wife, my success in 
life would have been greatly diminished from what it has been, if there 
has been any success. Oh, we are not half so appreciative of the blessing 
of good companionship as we should be. 

We have enjoyed the work of the mission; we are happy that 
Brother and Sister Joseph Quinney, Jr., have been chosen to succeed 
us. We have known these good people many years, they are not going 
to be found wanting in their responsibilities, I am sure. They are 
presiding over one of the finest missions in the world, and they are meet- 
ing a wonderfully fine people. I am sure that success will crown their 
noble efforts. 

I am grateful, above all, to you good fathers and mothers who have 
trusted your sons and daughters with us. Oh, what an enrichment has 
come into our lives in the companionship of those noble young men and 
women. Finer men and women do not live in any part of the world than 
those among whom we have labored in the Northwestern States Mission, 
and if I might ask only one favor of my Heavenly Father today, it would 
be that those young men and young women might be as loyal to this 
Church all the days of their lives as they were while they labored with 



us. 



May God grant that we too, Sister Sloan and I, may never find our- 
selves becoming soured, may never find ourselves disappointed, may never 
find ourselves in a condition or position where we have aught to complain 
about regarding our brethren in this Church. 

I love the leadership of this Church. I am in strict accord with 
them. I am happy to say that we have had almost five hundred young 
men and women labor with us in the mission field. Tens of thousands of 
copies of the Book of Mormon have been distributed in that mission 
almost twenty-five hundred baptisms have been performed during our 
term of office ; and so we have watched the mission grow Many new 
chapels have been erected, the people have prospered and developed and 
they are enjoying the spirit of the Gospel of Jesus Christ today 

I am happy, upon our release, to cast my lot with the people of the 
Northwest. I am happy for the favorable comments that have been made 
concerning our work. I was delighted a few weeks ago to be invited 



ELDER WILLIAM R. SLOAN 



81 



into a meeting of the leading business men of Portland, among them a 
former governor of the state, the mayor of the city, and other noted 
men of Portland. I sat at a luncheon with them. At the close of the 
luncheon they said: "Mr. Sloan, would you object to giving us a brief 
resume of your life." 

This I did, and they said : "You are the man we are looking for." 
I was offered then a very fine position with those gentlemen, and I am 
happy to tell you that I have accepted it. 

A few days later I was in the presence of one of these men, and 
during the course of our conversation he said these words : "Mr. Sloan, 
do you know why you were invited into that meeting ? Do you know why 
you were given this position?" 

I said, "I have no idea. Probably it would be interesting to me to 
know." 

He said: "I will tell you, then. Mr. Sloan, the reason you were 
given this position was the fact that you are a Mormon.", 

Oh, how my heart leaped with joy. "You are a Mormon." What 
greater heritage could I ask for ? 

God bless this Church, its manhood and its womanhood. As this 
gentlemen said those words the face of my mother was pictured in my 
mind and I remembered her teaching from infancy: "Son, your moral 
character is worth more to you than all life itself." 

Standing before you today I bear witness that the teachings of my 
mother and the teachings of this Church have carried me on, and now 
to stand and look honorable, virtuous men and women in the face, this is 
the heritage of this Church. Be not ashamed of it. Let us emulate 
the teachings of this Church. 

You brethren holding the Priesthood, I commend to you the reading 
of the book of Doctrine and Covenants. I commend to you that you ob- 
tain a knowledge of that book. 

May we cherish this work above all else in the earth, for it is not 
the work of man, it is of God. He is at the helm and it shall never fail. 
This is my testimony ; I leave it with you, in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

ELDER HAROLD W. PRATT 

President of the Mexican Mission 

My very dear brethren and sisters : Words cannot express the 
humility and the thankfulness with which I stand before you. I have 
not vocabulary sufficient to express to you the happiness, the honor, and 
the gratitude that Sister Pratt and I feel in having the opportunity of 
representing you, in representing the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter^ 
day Saints, in the mission field, among the Mexican people. 

I bring you greetings from the southern republic and from the 
thousands of Saints who have accepted the Gospel there. I should like 
to have time to tell you of the work we are doing. You have been told 



82 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



this afternoon of the work that has been accomplished in Europe in 
organizing the branches there and in placing the local Priesthood in 
charge. 

That work is being undertaken in the Mexican Mission today. In 
part it has been accomplished, through necessity, in the central part 
of the republic, due to the fact that our missionaries cannot work there 
on) account of the religious laws. Those people have responded wonder- 
fully, and even in our branches along the border today we are following 
the example of the European missions, and find that everywhere the local 
Priesthood, our Mexican brethren, are responding to the call of duty, 
and taking an active part in the management and self-government of 
their branches. 

As has been expressed regarding the European Saints, the same is 
true regarding the Mexican Saints. They feel more interest in the work, 
they feel that they are now becoming real members, participants in the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 

Much has been said, my brethren and sisters, during this conference 
in tribute and honor to those who have passed recently from our midst. 
I should like to take time to express just one more thought of appreciation 
of President Anthony W. Ivins. I knew him intimately when I was a 
lad. He and my father at that time were closely associated, and it is thus 
that I remember him best, expressed in the thought that he was a man to 
whom I could go, even then, with any questions that might arise, confident 
that I would get an answer. He was my ideal then and has been through- 
out my life. I have watched him and watched his career ; I have watched 
the reports regarding him, and have failed to find one point in him which 
I might criticize. 

I only wish that I might emulate his example, and might be as good 
a Church-man as he. It has been difficult to see who could pick up his 
burden, but I feel that the Lord has made the proper choice. I testify to 
you this afternoon that this is the Lord's work, and it does not depend up- 
on any one man. The Lord can always supply a man to pick up the duties 
laid down by any man whom he sees fit to call home. 

I testify unto you, my brethren and sisters, that I know that God 
lives, and that this is his work. I know that the General Authorities of 
this Church are called of him ; I testify that Joseph Smith was a prophet 
of God, and further, that Heber J. Grant is today our prophet and seer, 
the representative of God upon the earth. 

We today have held up our hands sustaining him and sustaining 
those called to assist him in presiding over us. As for me and mine, I 
hope that we shall always be able to sustain him and those associated 
with him in very deed. 

May the blessing of our Father be poured out upon the Church 
throughout the world. May his blessings be poured out upon the world, 
may the serious times of which we have been told, and of which we know, 
pass by, and may his directing hand guide the nations of the earth 
and the peoples of the world, that his will may be accomplished, I ask in 
his name. Amen. 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON

ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 

Presiding Bishop of the Church 

I am grateful, my brethren and sisters, to have the privilege of par- 
taking with you of the spirit of this session, and of the preceding sessions 
of this conference. I am happy in the selection of the splendid men who 
have been called into these positions in the Church. I support them with 
all my heart, just as I support all of the General Authorities of the 
Church. Likewise, I sustain and have faith and confidence in the stake 
and ward authorities and the mission officers and all of the members 
of the Church. I rejoice in the spirit of faith that has been evidenced 
in the sessions of the conference. I have been greatly edified, strength- 
ened and encouraged. I rejoice in the progress that the Church is mak- 
ing in every direction. 

INCREASE OF RESPECT FOR THE CHURCH 

Recently I had occasion to visit throughout the East, and also in the 
West; and everywhere I have gone I have found that the Church is 
growing in respect and recognition among the people who are not of our 
faith. There are many things that are helping to bring about this condi- 
tion. I am sure that we have a power in this Church that we scarcely 
appreciate . That is the power of righteousness, of dependability, of in- 
tegrity. Through the coordination, cooperation and united effort of 
the Latter-day Saints, even greater progress and greater recognition 
can be brought to pass, not only in this nation, but throughout the na- 
tions of the world. As people of the world come to understand our 
actual motives and efforts, they are bound to give greater consideration 
to our message. For the real purpose of this work is to promote the 
welfare of mankind here and hereafter — to bring them unto truth and 
the way of eternal life. 

A BALANCED BUDGET 

The Church is progressing financially as well as spiritually. I may 
say to you that the Church has a balanced budget. The First Presi- 
dency, and those associated with them, have made estimates of income and 
expenditures for the Church as a whole for the year. For the first six 
months of this year the expenditures have been less than half of the 
budget set-up. The income of the Church has increased this year, 
the tithes, as well as the number of tithepayers, showing a material in- 
crease, and this in spite of the fact that we have had drouth and other 
unfavorable conditions. Whether it is an evidence of improvement in 
financial conditions or not, I am not able to say. But I am grateful that 
the Latter-day Saints are appreciating in larger measure the divinity 
of this principle, as well as of other principles of the Gospel, and are 
endeavoring to live in accordance therewith. May I say to you that the 
tithes are being expended entirely in accordance with the revelations 
of the Lord as contained in the 119th Section of the Doctrine and Cove- 
nants and with the general Church policy. They are being disbursed with 



84 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



economy and with care for those purposes that are of great concern, not 
only to the Latter-day Saints, but to the people of the world, for whom 
so much is being done because of the responsibility that is upon us to 
preach the Gospel and promote this message with which we are charged. 

BUILDING IMPROVEMENTS 

Among other things, the Church is doing more this year in the way 
of building improvements in the various wards and in a number of the 
missions. I believe that more commodious and more convenient build- 
ings are being erected at less cost than has been the case almost ever 
before. I hope to see the time come, as conditions will permit, when 
every ward throughout the Church, and every branch in the various mis- 
sions that warrants such a thing, shall have the conveniences of a suit- 
able meeting house which will provide the facilities necessary to carry 
out the various activities of the Church, as well as the proper condi- 
tions for divine worship. 

CEASE FAULT FINDING 

I was impressed when President Grant read certain parts of a 
section of the Doctrine and Covenants while referring to President 
Ivins and his outstanding habits and characteristics. He referred to a 
statement made in that revelation to the effect that we should cease to 
find fault with one another. That reminded me of an axiom 
with regard to fault-finding. "Nothing is easier than fault-finding ; 
no talent, no self-denial, no character, no brains are required 
to set up in the grumbling business." It is true that all of us 
have weaknesses, none of us has reached perfection, we are all sub- 
ject to, criticism, and we are all able to improve. If people are fair, if 
they are honest, and if they have criticisms to make, they will make them 
to the ones of whom they complain. They will tell them either person- 
ally or in writing, with their names signed to that which they write. If 
they have the courage and the honesty to do that, then the one who is 
criticized has the opportunity either to admit that their criticisms are right 
and profit thereby; or prove to them that their criticisms are wrong, 
in which case it is the critic's business to apologize. That is, I think, the 
only fair way to criticize. But to go about fault-finding and undermining 
the character or influence of those who are engaged in constructive 
activities, is a very unfair and cowardly method. 

EXAMPLES OF HONESTY 

Referring to the tributes that have been paid to the great men who 
have recently passed away in the Church, I am impressed with the 
fact that prominently among all the qualities they possessed was their 
unquestioned honesty and integrity. I think it was Pope who said : "An 
honest man is the noblest work of God." President Anthony W. Ivins 
and Elders Charles H. Hart and Franklin S. Richards were men of 
strict honesty. The statement made by the president of that great 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 



85 



life insurance company to President Grant, when he was selected a 
member of the Council of the Twelve, that because he recognized him to 
be fundamentally honest he changed his opinion regarding the other 
General Authorities of the Church, was impressive. I know of no man 
who is fundamentally more honest, whose honesty is less questioned, 
than that of President Heber J. Grant. That has been true of all the 
leaders of this Church from the beginning. They have set outstanding 
examples of trustworthiness. 

IMPORTANCE OF HONESTY 

Reference has already been made to the last Article of our Faith, 
that refers largely to the cardinal virtues, which are just as much a part 
of the Gospel and a part of our lives, as any principle. "We believe 
in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing good 
to all men," and so forth. This tenet expresses the importance of prac- 
ticing these fundamental virtues. Honesty lies at the very foundation 
of our individual and community life, our civilization, our organizations 
of government, and the membership of the Church. If we live the Gos- 
pel we can not be anything but honest ; if we are good citizens of this na- 
tion we can not properly be anything but honest. If honesty is lacking 
in the government, then it will gradually disintegrate. If graft, if rack- 
eteering, if other dishonest practices prevail, then there is bound to be 
lack of confidence, and there will develop an increasing attitude of dis- 
respect for law and for those who are called to administer the laws. 

HONESTY IN GOVERNMENT 

We are entitled to expect from every officer of the government that 
he be honest in his dealings ; and when he has the direction of employees 
of the government, that he shall require honesty and honest service from 
them ; and that in the handling of funds there shall be strict honesty, and 
great care and accuracy maintained. Honesty is a disposition to con- 
form to justice and honorable dealing, especially in regard to the rights 
of property. Likewise, it involves a determination to conform to justice 
and fair dealing in all our relations one with another. We can apply 
honesty to our actions as well as to our words. That is, of course, truth- 
fulness and straightforwardness. 

HONESTY AND TRUTHFULNESS IN POLITICS 

We are now engaging in a campaign for political purposes. It is 
important that every one who engages therein shall be careful to be hon- 
est and truthful in the statements! that he or she shall make, so that we 
may not indulge in acrimonious discussion and develop antagonism and 
ill feeling which is contrary to proper principles of political activity and 
of government. Our statements should be matters of fact and not of 
assumption. Our political views should be constructive and not destruc- 
tive. Any candidate who makes wild promises or advocates specious 
plans impracticable of fulfilment, or who has not previously proven him- 



86 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



self worthy of trust, should be rejected. Honest, dependable and capable 
citizens should be sought for positions in government. It is our business 
as voters to analyze carefully the character of the candidates and their 
viewpoints on public questions. 

HONESTY IN OUR LIVES 

It is expected of every one of us who are engaged in Church work, 
whether as members or as officers of the Church, that we shall exemplify 
in our lives the principle of honesty just as we do every other cardinal 
virtue, and every other principle of the Gospel. Thereby the Church 
will grow and thereby the faith and confidence of the people will be 
increased. I am happy to say that so far as my experience goes, almost 
without exception, the officers of the Church are thoroughly straight- 
forward and honest in their dealings. While it is true that, in large 
measure, I think in larger measure than in any other religious organiza- 
tion, men are called upon to handle trust funds in this Church, they are, 
generally speaking, very careful and strict. I think it is of great im- 
portance that we should stimulate in even larger measure this condition 
among the younger members of the Church who are growing up, that 
they may also develop that spirit of honesty, fair dealing and justice in 
their lives. 

BREAKDOWN OF HONESTY AND FAIR DEALING 

There is a trend in the world and throughout this nation in large 
measure, because of adverse conditions that have developed in the last 
few years, to break down the spirit of honesty, fairness, justice and 
truthfulness. There is a tendency to repudiate debts, whether interna- 
tional or local. There is a tendency sometimes to go into avoidable 
bankruptcy, whether it be in a municipal or in a private capacity. It is 
important that we, as parents, in our homes, and as officers of the 
Church, should fulfil the responsibility to teach and inspire in thei young 
people of the Church an appreciation of the worth of honesty ; and to 
inculcate in the lives of every one who has to deal with funds and who has 
to deal with his fellow men, an appreciation of the spirit of honesty, fair- 
dealing and justice. 

I have been astounded in hearing reports that come from business 
men of misconduct on the part of young men and possibly older men. 
There are, unfortunately, all too many instances in business life of 
young men, supposedly of good character and trustworthy, who have 
embezzled funds from their employers. In a number of such instances 
employers have protected the losses and protected their employes from 
prosecution. But, of course, having been found unworthy of trust, they 
and their families have to suffer through loss of employment and loss 
of confidence. Honesty is not only the best policy, it is the only policy 
that can bring peace and satisfaction to every individual. Concealment 
of misdeeds may be possible for a time, at least, but sooner or later any- 
one who fails to practice those virtues of trustworthiness and fair dealing 
will lose the confidence of his fellowmen and fail in those qualities 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 



87 



that lie at the very foundation of character and progress. Men may 
succeed, by devious means, in taking property that does not belong to 
them, but such practices will destroy the moral fiber of their being. Right 
of property is guaranteed to us under the constitution. It is true we 
are subject to the government and to its regulations; and it is true also 
that we must cooperate in sustaining the government, but at the same time 
the rights of property can not be made null and void without destroying 
the spirit and appreciation of fairness among mankind. 

DIVINE INJUNCTIONS 

From Mt. Sinai, many centuries ago, came the injunctions which 
are just as binding for our welfare at present as at that time : "Thou 
shalt not steal," "Thou shalt not bear false witness," and "Thou shalt 
not covet." The prophet Micah, at a later period, made the statement : 

What doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, 
and to walk humbly with thy God? 

Upon every one of us rests that obligation to endeavor to be fair, 
just, honest, straightforward and respectful of mutual rights in our 
association with our fellow men. If we take advantage of others by 
fraud, we are just as guilty as one who steals. If we are employees, it is 
our place to give full, true service for the compensation we receive ; if we 
are employers, to deal justly and fairly with our employees ; if we have 
the handling of trust funds or funds belonging to others, that we man- 
age them strictly and carefully, with a full sense of our responsibilities, 
and not for a moment touch one cent for our own purposes. 

NEEDS DO NOT JUSTIFY DISHONESTY 

It is true that in some instances people are greatly in need. Some- 
times there is real suffering. But there are ways and means whereby 
needed relief can be obtained, without taking that which does not belong 
to them. The Church is doing, and will do, that which is necessary 
for the welfare of; its members who may be in need. Besides, the gov- 
ernment and the other agencies that have the handling of relief funds 
are prepared to do that which is right, proper and fair, according to 
actual needs. 

HONESTY OF INDIVIDUAL AT HEART 

Unless there is ingrained in the "heart of the individual a real de- 
termination to be honest and straightforward, the trials and temptations 
which he or she will encounter in life will be such as to almost, if not 
quite, overpower their better motives. Therefore, the importance of 
thorough home training by the parents by example in their every act 
and by wise and frequent teaching of their children. At a certain age 
in childhood the desire to have that which they see is great, and the 
sense of propriety or ownership is lacking. So the careful training by 
parents, especially during such period of life, is particularly vital. As 
Shakespeare very aptly makes one of his characters, Polonius, say to his 



88 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



son Laertes: "This above all, to thine own self be true, and it shall 
follow as the night the day, thou canst not then be false to any man." 
In like manner, the officers of the Church can be very helpful in stimu- 
lating constantly an appreciation of the necessity of strict honesty in 
all matters pertaining to Church membership and activity, and to the 
affairs of life. 

HONESTY WITH THE LORD 

Just as we should undertake to be true to ourselves and in our 
relations with our fellow-men, so we should determine to be honest with 
the Lord. If we have faith in him and in the divinity of this work, 
we shall endeavor to be true to every principle and seek to practice 
every virtue which will help us to improve in right living. If we recog- 
nize our stewardship here upon the earth, we shall strive to be honest 
in our donations for the advancement of God's purposes. I believe 
that any man or woman who is a faithful tithepayer, who lives in ac- 
cordance with the spirit of that principle, will be honest in his or her 
dealings with his fellow man. I know it has been said by a banker here — 
not a member of our Church — that he was willing to trust a faithful tithe- 
payer. I am sure that viewpoint is correct. Rarely, if ever, can you 
find one who, is faithful in the spirit and practice of that principle who 
would act dishonestly or unfairly, so far as his understanding goes, with 
regard to other things. 

The Apostle Paul says: 

Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, 
whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are 
lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if 
there be any praise, think on these things. 

May the Lord help us in this respect, and in all other efforts to serve 
him, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The congregation sang the hymn, "How firm a foundation," after 
which Elder Walter K. Barton, President of the Franklin Stake, offered 
the closing prayer. 

Conference adjourned until Sunday morning, October 7, at 10 
o'clock. 



THIRD DAY 



MORNING MEETING 

Sunday, October 7. 

When the time arrived for commencing the fifth session of the 
Conference, every seat and available space in the great Tabernacle audi- 
torium and galleries was occupied by the people who had gathered from 
the stakes and missions of the Church. The large Assembly Hall on the 
Temple Block was also filled with people who could not find accommoda- 
tion in the Tabernacle, and hundreds of others assembled on the Taber- 
nacle grounds, where they were able, by means of amplifying equipment 
that had been installed, to listen to the Conference proceedings as they 
were broadcast from the Tabernacle. 

The Tabernacle Choir, under the direction of Professor Anthony 
C. Lund, furnished the music for this session. 

The meeting commenced promptly at 10 o'clock. 

The choir sang an anthem, "An Angel from on High," duet by 
Cyril Martin and Ida Hepworth. 

Elder Asael E. Palmer, President of the Lethbridge Stake, offered 
the invocation. 

The choir sang, "Lead kindly light." 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I would like to announce, as many of you may not be informed, 
that Brother Rufus K. Hardy is now presiding over the New Zealand 
Mission, which is the reason he does not appear on the stand. 

I wish to say for Brother Hardy that he is a man who is loved by all 
who know him. The older members of the Council of Seventy have 
nominated Brother Hardy, and we are very pleased indeed to approve 
their nomination. He is a tried and true Latter-day Saint. He had 
one of the most remarkable and splendid mothers. All of the rest of 
us have been talking about our mothers, so I will talk about his. 

Annie K. Hardy was an outstanding woman. 

PRESIDENT DAVID O. McKAY 

Second Counselor in the First Presidency 

My beloved brethren and sisters, if it were possible I would have you 
interpret my feelings this morning by looking into the depths of my soul, 
and thus save me the seeming impossibility of describing them to you. 
Needless to say I am overwhelmed. During the past few days I have 
had difficulty in keeping my thoughts and feelings under control. The 
light heart, the buoyancy of spirit that should accompany the high 
appointment that has come to me has been somewhat counter-balanced 



90 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



by a heaviness incident to the realization of the great responsibility that 
comes with the call to the First Presidency. 

PRESIDENT GRANT A TRUE FRIEND 

I love President Heber J. Grant. He has been to me a true friend; 
more than that, since my father died I have felt free to go to President 
Grant for help and counsel as I would go to my own father. His nature 
is as open, as pure and clear as a faultless crystal — open, loyal, true. I 
esteem it indeed the highest compliment and privilege to have this ex- 
pression of his confidence. With all my soul I pray for strength that I 
may not disappoint him, and that I may be true to the trust that he and 
my Heavenly Father have thus reposed in me. 

LOVE AND ADMIRATION FOR PRESIDENT CLARK 

I have known President Clark since my school days in the Uni- 
versity of Utah. 1 admired him then. I considered him one of the 
choicest young men I had ever seen or had ever known. His ability 
was evident even to his schoolmates. He and the sweet girl who later 
became my sweetheart and wife, were graduated with their A. B. degrees 
on the same day. We have followed him in his work in Washington, we 
were thrilled when we learned of the responsibility that he carried there, 
and the trust which the members of the Senate of the United States 
placed upon him even before his name was generally known. I love him 
as a friend, and to be associated with him now in this high quorum, the 
highest in the Church, makes me feel very happy and thankful, but also 
very humble. 

LIVES CONSECRATED TO SERVICE 

And so if you could look into my soul you would see sincere gratitude 
and deep appreciation. You would find there also a regret that I am 
leaving the immediate association with the members of the Council of 
the Twelve. For twenty-eight and one-half years it has been my privilege 
to work side by side with these good and able men. President Clawson 
I love with all my soul. His worth and ability are not generally known. 
He is retiring, he is quiet in his labors, a perfect gentleman, genial, kind, 
and considerate. As the president of the Council he is prompt in attend- 
ing to questions and problems referred to the group, as loyal and true 
in his testimony as the polar star, unwavering, undeviating in the dis- 
charging of duty and trust. It is not easy to disentwine my soul directly 
from his, my president. That entwinement is just as binding with the 
hearts of these brethren with whom I have worked daily, at times in com- 
mittees, considering the welfare of the Church at large, and the welfare 
of individuals. I want to bear witness today that you may travel the 
world over, you may read your histories of men devoted to great under- 
takings, and noble problems, but you cannot find a group of men whose 
lives are more consecrated, whose desires are more noble in the interests, 
the happiness and peace of mankind, than are the lives and desires of 
these, my associates in the Council of the Twelve Apostles of this Church. 



ELDER DAVID O. McKAY 



91 



You must live with them to know them. You must be in daily contact 
with the burdens they are carrying, with their concerns and anxieties 
for the youth, their willingness to go to the ends of the world at a 
moment's call if need be to establish better conditions, to make the world 
happier, more peaceful, more just, and bring about more amicable condi- 
tions and relationships in human society. And so it is not an easy task, 
I say, it is not without regret that I withdraw my membership in that 
Council. 

APPRECIATIVE OF TRUST 

I appreciate the trust you, my brethren and sisters, have manifested 
in me. It is a wonderful thing to be trusted. I said last night to the 
brethren of the Priesthood that I agree with him who says that to be trust- 
ed is a greater compliment than to be loved. Love is the sweetest thing in 
the world, but to be trusted throws upon him who receives that trust 
an obligation that he must not fail to discharge. And so I pledge you 
here, my fellow workers in the First Presidency, you my brethren of 
the Priesthood, in whose company I have spent so many happy hours in 
Priesthood and auxiliary work, I pledge you, my brethren and sisters, 
to give my best in the service of God. 

I uphold before you this morning the President of this Church 
as God's representative, divinely appointed, and say to all Israel, stand by 
your chief. Let that spirit of unity and oneness for which our Lord and 
Savior prayed on the night of his betrayal, be characteristic of this his 
Church : Father, keep them one, as thou and I are one. 

' MAN DESTINED TO BE HAPPY 

I am happy when I know that my associates are happy. We cannot 
be happy if our loved ones are discouraged or ill. We are social beings 
and our lives are intricately woven one with another, and we progress as 
a body when individuals in the body progress. I have noted recently 
something which has given me concern. I have thought that I 
have detected in men and women who have called upon me and whom 
I have met in my travels just a little evidence of discouragement, and yet 
it is our right to be happy. It is the destiny of man to have joy, and I 
ask, during the few moments that I further stand before you that you 
direct your attention with me along some lines which may help us to keep 
that joy, notwithstanding the economic conditions and the failures that 
have brought about many moments of discouragement- and sadness. 

DISTRESSFUL CONDITIONS 

Difficulties and sorrows have recently been dominant in our lives. 
The unprecedented crises in the financial world have dislodged men from 
their old moorings and set them adrift in confusion and in many cases 
despair. Land owners have seen their farms pass to others' hands, while 
they themselves distractedly seek new arid strange employment. Families 
have lost their homes with which are associated the tender memories of 
half a lifetime. Young men and young women recently graduated from 



92 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



college, eager to start out in a chosen vocation or a profession, find 
avenues that were formerly open and inviting now closed against them, 
and they seek advice and guidance, and sometimes we find difficulty in 
pointing out to them an encouraging road. 

To these and other distresses has been added the sorrow associated 
with, the passing of loved ones and to the Church the loss of great and 
able leaders. I had the privilege and honor through the kindness of 
President Ivins' family to express my feelings towards that great leader 
and I sense with you all that his passing means to this Church. 

SUNSHINE NEEDED 

But notwithstanding these conditions I feel like pleading with my 
brethren and sisters to set their faces firmly to the front and decide 
to enjoy the blessings with which our Father has blessed us. 

There are seeds of happiness planted in every human soul. Our 
mental attitude and disposition constitute the environment in which these 
seeds may germinate. There is as much need for sunshine in the heart 
as for sunshine in the world. Today as perhaps never before mankind 
needs encouragement and cheer. One writer says : "Not having enough 
sunshine is what ailed the world. Make people happy and there will 
not be half the quarreling nor a tenth part of the wickedness there is." 

It is a duty to seek to acquire the art of being cheerful — "A cheerful 
spirit is one of the most valuable gifts ever bestowed upon humanity by 
a kind Creator. It is the sweetest and most fragrant flower of the 
spirit that constantly sends out its beauty and fragrance and blesses every- 
thing within its reach." I think the writer goes to a little extreme. Cheer- 
fulness is but one quality, but it is a wonderful strength in time of 
distress. 

THE PURPOSE OF WORLDLY POSSESSIONS 

If the experience of the past few years has taught us anything it 
has taught us that it is unwise to seek happiness in worldly possessions 
only. I say only because I do not minimize the value of material things 
of the world as contributing factors to man's peace, joy and contentment. 
The Lord himself has said that if we worship him with rejoicing and 
prayer, with glad hearts and cheerful countenances, the fulness of the 
earth is ours. 

In the Doctrine and Covenants he says plainly: 

The fulness of the earth is yours, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the 
air, and that which climbeth upon the trees and walketh upon the earth; 

Yea, and the herb, and the good things which come of the earth, whether 
for food or for raiment, or for houses, or for barns, or for orchards, or for gardens, 
or for vineyards; 

Yea, all things which come of the earth, in the season thereof, are made 
for the benefit and the use of man, both to please the eye and to gladden the 
heart ; 

Yea, for food and for raiment, for taste and for smell, to strengthen the 
body and to enliven the soul. 

And it pleaseth God that he hath given all these things unto man; for unto this 
end were they made to be used, with judgment, not to excess, neither for extortion. 



ELDER DAVID O. McKAY 



93 



However, to seek happiness or even contentment in the acquisition 
of these worldly things alone is to lose sight of the higher purpose of 
life. And that is one reason why there is discouragement and why there 
is despair generally in the world. The seeking of these material things 
has been the end, and now that they seem to be suddenly wiped away, 
men are distracted: 

A PROPER SENSE OF VALUES 

In "The Simple Life" by Charles Wagner, he writes upon this 
theme and says, referring to material things : "Let your needs rule you, 
pamper them — you will see them multiply like insects in the sun. The 
more you give them the more they demand. He is senseless who seeks 
for happiness in material prosperity alone." 

Recently I re-read an excellent book written by one of our educators, 
Dr. R. V. Chamberlain, as a tribute to his departed brother. It is a treat- 
ise on the philosophy of a good man's life. From it I quote the following : 

The world has progressed because of people who cared but little for material 
rewards, people who knew that mortal self-denial is the only path to self-realization. 
By sacrificing our ideals we do not throw ourselves away, but achieve the higher 
sides of ourselves. Civilization has come from the struggles of men and women 
in the past who risked all for ideals, for spiritual values that they might become 
the common possession of the race. We who see the path today are unworthy if 
we do not take up the burden. The race goes down when it loses its sense of values, 
and the success of democracy depends upon the people's living in the understanding 
of the spirit and the obligations of righteousness. In the world today men have 
not advanced their ideals with an intensity commensurate with economics and 
material expansion. Wisdom has not kept pace with learning, nor righteousness 
with power. 

So many people have lost the proper sense of values, and have 
sought peace and happiness in vain in the acquisition of wealth at the 
expense of spiritual growth. 

THE SECRET OF HAPPINESS 

Wherein then does the secret of happiness lie ? The Savior gives us 
the key to it when he says : "The kingdom of God is within you." The 
power is within man to choose the right or to choose the wrong. Happi- 
ness is not an external condition, it is a state of the spirit and attitude of 
the mind. 

It's no' in titles nor in the rank, 
It's no' in wealth like Lun'on bank, 
To purchase peace and rest. 
It's no' in makin' muckle mair, 
It's no' in books, it's no' in lear 
To make us truly blest, 

If happiness ha'e not her center i' the breast. 
We may be wise or rich or great, 
But never can be blest — 

Nae pleasures, nor treasures can make us happy lang, 
The heart aye's the part aye 
That makes us right or wrang.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



FUNDAMENTAL CONDITIONS 

Let us consider this morning four conditions in which we can always 
find happiness, conditions which are to the little seeds of joy in our 
souls what the ray of light and moisture are to the flowers and growing 
plants. 

First is Trust in God. To have faith that God is our Father is the 
safest anchorage of the soul and brings peace and solace under any 
condition ; and the second is Confidence in Our Fellow Men. You note 
at once, of course, how these go back to those two great commandments : 
"Love the Lord with all thy might, mind, and strength, and thy neighbor 
as thyself." 

Now let us not consider these merely as orthodox principles. They 
are fundamental in our happiness and salvation here. I know that it is a 
little difficult today to keep confidence in certain groups of men. It is 
dreadfully discouraging to lose confidence in an associate. When we 
see and read about human jackals who are preying upon society, we find 
it hard sometimes to keep our poise and let the sunshine of confidence 
enter our souls, and yet I believe it is true that mankind generally are 
growing better. This I do know that often when we misjudge a brother 
and seem to lose confidence in him, if we will go to him and find his point 
of view our confidence will be restored. The poet was right when he 
said : 

Have you ever sat down and talked with men in a serious sort of way, 

Of their views of life, and pondered then on all they had to say? 

If not, you should, in some quiet hour ; 

It's a glorious thing to do, 

For back of the wealth and back of the power 

Most men have a goal in view. 

Associate that thought with the fundamental teaching of our Lord 
and Master, who said: "If ye have aught against a brother, go to him." 

COUNT YOUR BLESSINGS 

Brethren and sisters, with debts piled upon you, with difficulty to 
pay your taxes, with the loss of your home pending, if you would still be 
happy, look to yourself and count your blessings, and keep confidence in 
your God and in your fellow man. 

Another source of joy within your reach is the proper evaluation of 
blessings. You have your health. Next to life itself that is one of the 
greatest blessings that can come to you — the second blessing that we 
mortals are capable of receiving, a blessing that money cannot buy. If 
you have it, thank the Lord night and morning that he has given it to you. 

In addition to this he has given you ability to appreciate his glorious 
Gospel, the sunshine, the voice of nature speaking to you. Do you open 
your eyes and see it? I have rejoiced during this conference to hear the 
brethren acknowledge the blessing of our environment, the products of 
the field, scanty as they are, in some sections of the country, the flowers 
blooming, the sunsets, and above all the realization that we are living in 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY 



95 



God's world and that he is the Creator of it. If you stop to think you 
still have the power and ability to appreciate and to enjoy things which 
no one, no depression can take from you. 

There is something else which we sometimes do not properly evalu- 
ate. That is our family. I know it hurts us if we see our loved ones 
hungry. As President Grant so impressively said, there is no need of any 
child being hungry in this Church. Let us thank God for the organization 
and say we will buckle to and make our contributions so that these 
conditions will be removed, and thank him for our loved ones, ours for 
time and all eternity. 

SOCIAL INTERCOURSE 

Finally, you have the opportunity for social intercourse, an ever 
present condition of happiness. If you affiliate with your quorum and 
other organizations, meeting regularly with your fellow men, you will 
know what that brotherhood is to which I have referred in my association 
with these brethren in the Council of the Twelve, a brotherhood which 
is eternal, a family relationship and social contact which will drive sorrow 
away under any conditions, and you have too the realization that even 
if death should come you have the assurance that death is now victorious 
but has been overcome in the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
Count these blessings. They are within the reach of every soul, no mat- 
ter how humble or how great. 

Admire the goodness of Almighty God. 

He riches gave, He intellectual strength to few, 

Nor now commands to be nor rich nor learned, 

Nor promises reward of peace to these. 

On all he moral worth bestowed, 

And moral tribute asks from all, 

And who that could not pay ? 

Who born so poor of intellect, so mean 

Who born so poor as not to know what seemed the best, 

And unknowing might not do? 

And he who acted thus fulfilled the law eternal 

And its promises reaped in peace. 

That means that you know what is right. If you have lived true to 
that prompting of the Holy Spirit and continue to do so happiness will 
fill your soul. If you vary from it and become conscious you have fallen 
short of what you know is right, you are going to be unhappy if you 
have the wealth of the world. To do that is to "seek roses on the 
cheek of death," "grapes 'neath the icy pole," "substance in a world 
of fleeting shades." 

A GUIDE 

And so, brethren and sisters, what if we do have economic distress, 
universal almost? Let us ever keep in mind that life is largely what we 
make it, and that the Savior of men has marked clearly and plainly just 
how joy and peace may be obtained. It is in the Gospel of Jesus Christ 
and adherence thereto. Do your duties no matter how humbly, and resolve 
even in the face of difficulties and discouragements to be : 



96 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Like the man who faces what he must 
With step triumphant and a heart of cheer; 
Who fights the daily battle without fear ; 
Sees his hopes fail, yet keeps unfaltering trust 
That God is God. 

Happy the people whose God is the Lord, says the Psalmist 

— that somehow, true and just 

His plans work out for mortals ; not a tear 

Is shed when fortune, which the world holds dear, 

Falls from his grasp ; better, with love, a crust 

Than living in dishonor ; envies not, 

Nor loses faith in man; but does his best, 

Nor ever mourns over his humbler lot, 

But with a smile and words of hope, gives zest 

To every toiler ! he alone is great 

Who by a life heroic conquers fate. 

And the Holy Ghost, to which each one who has obeyed the first 
principles of the Gospel is entitled will give him or her that heroic soul 
and bring peace, peace even in the midst of disaster. 

May God bless us all with power to keep our post, to do our duty, 
and under all circumstances to be true to him and to each other, I pray 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir and congregation joined in singing the hymn, "Praise 
to the man who communed with Jehovah." 

PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 

First Counselor in the First Presidency 

My brethren and sisters, once more I stand before you, the ben- 
eficiary of your trust and confidence. You have honored me as I have 
never been honored before. You have placed upon me a responsibility 
which I never before had. I can only say to you that every atom of 
strength which I possess will be used so to live that I may merit the 
trust and the confidence which you have indicated, and that I may re- 
ceive the inspiration and the blessings which I must ask you to ask the 
Lord to give unto me. 

We are missing today the face, perhaps not the presence, of one 
who has been with us during a long life, President Ivins. For his great 
work, for the lesson of his life, for his faith, for his counsel, we are all 
devoutly grateful. The most earnest hope that I myself have is that 
while it shall please the Lord to have me in the place which he held, I shall 
be measurably able to do the work which he performed. 

CONFERENCES TO IMPART SPIRITUALITY 

I missed this morning, speaking personally, the broadcast of the 
choir. It has seemed to me, in the times that I have been here, that 
nothing has given us more of the Spirit with which to begin a session than 
their beautiful singing. I accompanied them to Chicago. I rejoiced in their 



PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 



97 



success. I congratulate them in their excellence. I pray the Lord to 
continue to bless them. 

We are met today in a general conference. Sometimes, I hear, 
the people feel, some of them, that perhaps we are not quite as "peppy" 
as we ought to be. But this is not a Church convention. This is a gen- 
eral conference where we meet for general counsel and advice. It is a 
place to which we come for the results of the reflective operations of our 
minds. We expect to hear reflective discourse. It is a sort of spiritual 
stock-taking for us. It is not so much the mechanics of the operation 
of the Church, that is concerned in a general conference, as it is the 
spirituality with which each and every one of us shall approach his re- 
spective duties in the Church. 

I want to approve, with all of my heart, all that has been said during 
this conference. This morning, if the Lord shall so lead me, I want to 
follow along the lines that were drawn by Brother Stephen L. Richards 
and referred to by Brother George Albert Smith, and in doing that I 
wish to assure you that I have in my heart nothing but the deepest sym- 
pathy for those who are in distress. And yet, as Brother McKay 
has beautifully pointed out to us this morning, there are other things 
in life than those material blessings to get which so many of the world 
have solely set their hearts. 

LATTER-DAY SAINTS SHOULD SET EXAMPLE 

Eighteen months ago, when first I stood before you I called atten- 
tention, as earnestly and seriously as I knew how, to what looked to me 
to be the dangers that were ahead, and I urged you at that time to practice 
the old virtues of thrift, of honesty, of truthfulness, of industry, and so 
on through the list of those I named. All that I said then I say again. 

One year ago, on this occasion, I called your attention to the abuses 
that had crept into the distribution of our public funds, and I urged you 
and pleaded with you that, so far as the Church and its membership 
were concerned, we do not soil our hands with the bounteous outpouring 
of funds which the government was giving unto us. I renew that plea 
now. My brethren and sisters, for the sake of the government which we 
love, for the sake of the government which we believe was divinely 
inspired, be honest with it. Be honest, just ordinarily gold honest. That 
is all I ask. 

Do you know that all of the money that we are spending, that the 
government is spending, must come from you ? The government has no 
great pile of gold to which it can go to -get what it gives you. The gov- 
ernment has not one cent that it does not take from your pockets. Do 
not imagine, do not believe, do not go on the theory that you are not to 
pay this bill, unless the fundamentals of our government are to be over- 
turned. 

What we get, we members of the Church, compared with the total 
mass that is distributed, is almost microscopic, but the spirit in which 
we might take it, the spirit in which we might spend it, is the leaven that 



98 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



might leaven the whole lump. Let us be patriotic ; let us love the govern- 
ment under which we live. 

I am persuaded, from all the facts that have come to me, that it 
would have been possible, if we had functioned as the Lord intended 
us to function, if we had paid our tithes and our offerings as the Lord 
intended us to pay them, we might have gone on without one dollar 
from our federal government. And has it ever occurred to you what a 
mighty influence we should have exercised for good and for respect and 
for all of the virtues that we have been taught, and that God has com- 
manded us to exercise and cultivate and practice, if we had just fol- 
lowed along what he has asked us to do ? 

DESPOTISM, DESTRUCTIVE TO RELIGION AND GOVERNMENT IDEALS 

My brethren and sisters, there are abroad in the world forces — 
and this I have been saying to you on every occasion that presented itself 
for the last fifteen years, here in this pulpit — there are forces abroad 
that do not come from God. There is no dictatorship in the world 
today, whether that dictatorship be of one man or of a group exercising 
such control as exists in Russia, that is not striking first and foremost 
at religion. They are trying to tear down the worship of God and to 
substitute something else in its stead, and I regret to say that in some 
parts of this country, in some states of this Union, the issue now seems 
to be between an ordered, law-governed society and a despotism destruc- 
tive of religion and of all that our government stands for. I assume 
this because of the past record of those who are advocating the measures 
to which I refer. 

May I say this : We believe that Christ will come and reign per- 
sonally upon the earth. But that is no reason why I should advocate the 
establishment of a monarchy to overturn the government of the United 
States. We believe in the United Order, something that was taken away 
from us because we could not live it, and the lesser law was given, the law 
of tithing — which we are not living either ; but our belief in the United 
Order is no reason why we should support a movement for Communism, 
to the overturning of our government. These two propositions are abso- 
lutely parallel, the one as rational and reasonable as the other. When the 
Lord wants his people to move into the United Order he will use his 
anointed servant to direct the way. 

SUBSTITUTION 

My brethren and sisters, this same element of which I speak — 
small, I feel sure, and I thank God for this — this same element would 
substitute for the law that has come to us for over thirty-five hundred 
years, "Thou shalt not steal," and "Thou shalt not covet," they would 
substitute the opposite "Steal from those who have. Covet all that 
your neighbor possesses." 

The Lord has spoken very clearly about these things. He has not left 
us in darkness on these matters. I am going to read a few verses 
from Section 56 of the Doctrine and Covenants, given in connection 



PRESIDENT 7. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 



99 



with the rapacity, the pride, and the selfishness of one of the early 
members of the Church: 

Behold, thus saith the Lord unto my people, you have many things to do 
and to repent of; for behold, your sins have come up unto me, and are not par- 
doned, because you seek to counsel in your own ways. 

And your hearts are not satisfied. And ye obey not the truth, but have pleasure 
in unrighteousness. 

Wo unto you rich men, that will not give your substance to the poor, for your 
riches will canker your souls; and this shall be your lamentation in the day of 
visitation and of judgment, and of indignation: The harvest is past, the summer 
is ended, and my soul is not saved ! 

RELY ON THE LORD'S PLAN 

I refer to the words of Elder Richards, and I tell you that any 
Latter-day Saint who does pay an income tax, and who at the same time 
pays his tithing, his fast offerings, his donations, his help for the poor, 
will never be able to get the full benefit under the fifteen per cent which 
the tax income provides for. In other words, those men among us who 
have the Spirit of the Lord, and who obey his laws, will always spend 
more than fifteen per cent of their income for the Church and its work 
and people. That is one reason why I say to you as I said a few 
moments ago, that if we had but hearkened to the Lord and obeyed 
his commandments there would have been no occasion for us to have 
drawn on the federal government. I also say to you that in my opinion, 
reached after mature reflection, this people would have been better off ma- 
terially and spiritually, if we had relied on the Lord's plan and had not 
used one dollar of government funds. 

This revelation goes on: 

Wo unto you poor men, whose hearts are not broken, whose spirits are not 
contrite, and whose bellies arel not satisfied, and whose hands are not stayed from 
laying hold upon other men's goods, whose eyes are full of greediness, and who 
will not labor with your own hands ! 

Those are not my words, my brethren and sisters. Those are the 
words of the Lord, a commandment to this day and generation. 

For behold, (the revelation continues) the Lord shall come, and his recompense 
shall be with him, and he shall reward every man, and the poor shall rejoice; 

And their generations shall inherit the earth, from generation to generation, 
forever and ever. And now I make an end of speaking unto you. Even so. Amen. 

THROUGH HONESTY COMES POWER AND DIGNITY 

My brethren and sisters, once more I appeal to your patriotism, I 
appeal to your integrity, I appeal to your standing in the Church — in 
your dealings with the government be just plain, simple, money honest. 
Then there will come among this people such a spirit of power and dignity 
and of uplifting, that has not been known in my generation at least. 

I thank you for those of you who are faithful — and you are the great 
majority — for those of you who are trying to follow after the foot-steps 
of the Master, for those of you who are doing your utmost to live the 



100 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Gospel of Christ, for those of you who can say, as did Paul of old to 
Timothy, — and I want to read it : 

For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. 
I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith : 

Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, 
the righteous judge, shall give me at that day; and not to me only, but unto al] 
them also that love his appearing. 

Again, my brethren and sisters, in this hour, filled with love and 
with respect for this government of ours, which if men do not change 
their greediness and their avarice and their covetousness, stands in 
gravest danger, — again I plead with you, be money honest with our 
government. 

May God give us his Spirit at all times and in all circumstances, 
and enable us to live as he would have usl live, always true and faithful 
to his principles, I ask in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAWSON 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

My brethren and sisters, this great gathering is an amazing sight. 
The Tabernacle is filled to its utmost capacity. Last evening it was 
reported there were five thousand of the Priesthood assembled here. 
Later word came that the number was seven thousand. I presume there 
are some people who would interpret this to mean that Mormonism is 
failing. I have been thrilled with the spirit of this conference ; the testi- 
monies and exhortations that have been given were powerful, and the 
singing has been most excellent. 

I desire to speak a word of appreciation for the Singing Mothers 
who have done so well during the conference, under the direction of 
Mrs. Charlotte Sackett, a capable leader. As to the Tabernacle Choir, 
I need only to say its work is "par excellence." 

INTELLIGENCE NECESSARY TO ACCEPTABLE WORSHIP 

Brethren and sisters, the moments are precious, and in order to 
conserve the time, I jotted down a few thoughts that have been running 
through my mind during the conference. This is the fifth session of the 
conference. We are assembled here to worship the Lord, but we cannot 
worship him intelligently and acceptably without some knowledge of just 
What kind of being he is. 

Paul, the apostle, said: "This is life eternal that they might know 
thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent." There 
are some people in the world around us who contend that God is a being 
without body, parts or passions, and is incomprehensible. Truly such a 
God is incomprehensible. 

ATTRIBUTES ASCRIBED TO GOD 

The) God of the Bible, that being whom the Latter-day Saints wor- 



PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAW SON 



101 



ship, it is evident, has a body, parts and passions, for in the beginning 
he said : 

"Let us make man in our image, after our likeness." And the rec- 
ord goes on to say that God did make man in his own image and after 
his likeness. It is disclosed in Holy Writ that Moses saw God and 
talked with him face to face. It is also recorded that Christ Jesus was in 
the express image of God his Father. 

The attributes of God which in combination go to make his character 
are glorious to contemplate. The Lord is a God of mercy, a God of truth, 
a God of justice and a God of love. In respect to these great attributes 
God is unchangeable. In Malachi the following scripture is found : 

For I am the Lord, I change not ; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed. 

In one of the Psalms we read "The Lord is merciful and gracious, 
slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy." These references clearly indi- 
cate that God has passions. 

And on the other hand, my brethren and sisters, the Lord refers to 
himself as a God of vengeance, and I am going to read to you now a 
few words from the book of Doctrine and Covenants. Let me 
emphasize the importance of this record. It is a great book. It con- 
tains revelations of God in latter times, given to Joseph Smith the 
Prophet, and others. I refer to Section 133, and the words there re- 
corded are extremely important and impressive : 

And it shall be said : 'Who is this that cometh down from God in heaven with 
dyed garments ; yea, from the regions which are not known, clothed in his glor- 
ious apparel, traveling in the greatness of his strength? 

And he shall say : I am he who spake in righteousness, mighty to save. 

And the Lord shall be red in his apparel, and his garments like him that 
treadeth in the wine-vat. 

And so great shall be the glory of his presence that the sun shall hide his face 
in shame, and the moon shall withhold its light, and the stars shall be hurled from 
their places. 

And his voice shall be heard : I have trodden the wine-press alone, and have 
brought judgment upon all people; and none were with me; 

And I have trampled them in my fury, and I did tread upon them in mine 
anger, and their blood have I sprinkled upon my garments, and stained all my 
raiment; for this was the day of vengeance which was in my heart. 

And again, in the same great section : 

And also that which was written by the prophet Malachi: For, behold, the 
day cometh that shall burn as an oven, and all the proud, yea, and all that do 
wickedly, shall be stubble ; and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the 
Lord of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch. 

WICKED WILL HAVE OPPORTUNITY 

The great mercy of the Lord, however, is shown by the fact that 
he will withhold his final judgment from overtaking the wicked till after 
the Gospel has been preached to them, the message reaching every nation, 
kindred, tongue and people. The responsibility of putting over the Gos- 



102 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



pel message rests with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 
through its important missionary system. 

The contrast between the destruction of the wicked and the salva- 
tion of the righteous is set forth in impressive language in Section 133 
also. Now, listen, my brethren and sisters, to these wonderful words 
of the Lord : 

And now the year of my redeemed is come ; and they shall mention the loving 
kindness of their Lord, and all that he has bestowed upon them according to his 
goodness, and according to his loving kindness, forever and ever. 

In all their afflictions he was afflicted. And the angel of his presence saved 
them ; and in his love, and in his pity, he redeemed them, and bore them, and 
carried them all the days of old. 

Yea, and Enoch also, and they who were with him ; the prophets who were 
before him ; and Noah also, and they who were before him ; and Moses also, and, 
they who were before him ; 

And from Moses to Elijah, and from Elijah to John, who were with Christ 
in his resurrection, and the holy apostles, with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, shall 
be in the presence of the Lamb. 

And the graves of the saints shall be opened ; and they shall come forth and 
stand on the right hand of the Lamb, when he shall stand upon Mount Zion, and 
upon the holy city, the New Jerusalem ; and they shall sing the song of the Lamb, 
day and night forever and ever. 

And for this cause, that men might be made partakers of the glories which 
were to be revealed, the Lord sent forth the fulness of his gospel, his everlasting 
covenant, reasoning in plainness and simplicity. 

And then this further: 

For since the beginning of the world have not men heard nor perceived by the 
ear, neither hath any eye seen, O God, besides thee, how great things thou hast 
prepared for him that waiteth for thee. 

THE TWO ROADS 

It will be seen, from the foregoing impressive and stirring words 
of the revelation given to the Latter-day Saints, that in the great scheme 
of life there are two roads to travel, and it is the privilege of every human 
soul to determine, under the God-given right of his free agency, which 
road he will elect to follow. If he chooses the road of wickedness it will 
lead him down to certain destruction. If he chooses the road of right- 
eousness it will lead him up to everlasting life in a kingdom of glory. 

Brethren and sisters, Latter-day Saints, you have elected to follow 
the road of righteousness. So continue, but remember this : "The race is 
not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, but to him that endureth 
to the end." 

CHANGES IN PRESIDING COUNCILS 

Within three and one-half years, as was mentioned in one of yes- 
terday's meetings, some nine of the General Authorities of the Church 
have gone hence. Death came and took them. There were two mem- 
bers of the First Presidency, President Anthony W. Ivins and President 
Charles W. Nibley. There were two members of the Council of the 
Twelve, Brother Orson F. Whitney and Brother James E. Talmage. 



PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAWSON 



103 



There was the Patriarch, Brother Hyrum G. Smith ; and four members 
of the First Council of Seventy, Brother Rey L. Pratt, Brother Joseph 
W. McMurrin, Brother B. H. Roberts, and last week, Brother Charles 
H. Hart. These were great and good men. They were valiant for the 
testimony of Jesus. They did a good work and kept the faith, and thus 
it was that they followed the road to righteousness. They will come 
forth in the morning of the first resurrection and enter into immortality 
and eternal life. 

Now the gap that has been made by death in the ranks of these 
leading quorums has been closed. We will greatly miss Presidents 
Ivins and Nibley and these brethren of the First Council who were strong 
in testimony and wise in exhortation. Others have come to take their 
place, and it must be a satisfaction to the Latter-day Saints, to the 
Church generally, that there is now no rent, no gap in these higher coun- 
cils of the Church. 

Brother David O. McKay has gone from the Council of the Twelve 
and is now sustained as Second Counselor in the quorum of the First 
Presidency. He is a man that we have truly loved. He has had our ut- 
most confidence. As a member of the Council of the Twelve he accom- 
plished a great and a good work that will follow him throughout life 
and throughout all eternity. 

BEARS TESTIMONY 

In conclusion permit me, my brethren and sisters, to bear my 
testimony. I love the Lord God because I can comprehend him, because 
I know that he has a body, parts and passions, and is in the form of 
man. I love him because of the glorious attributes of his character, and, 
thus loving him, I feel that I can approach him, can worship him ac- 
ceptably and intelligently. I love Jesus Christ because he is the Son of 
the living God and is in the likeness of his Father. I can comprehend 
that. I love him particularly for the great atonement that he wrought 
out through the shedding of his precious blood. He is your Savior 
and he is my Savior. I love Joseph Smith because he was and is a true 
prophet of God, who stands at the head of this great last dispensation. 
I know that this is the work of God and that it will never be overthrown. 

I pray God the Eternal Father to bless the Latter-day Saints, to 
bless the Presidency of the Church and the Twelve and the First Coun- 
cil of Seventy, to bless all the leaders of the Church down through the 
various ranks of the Priesthood. This I do in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

A TRIBUTE TO PRESIDENT IVINS 

The Apostle Paul revealed the secret of the grandeur of his life when 
he said : "Yet not I, but Christ liveth in me." President Anthony W. 



104 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Ivins with equal truth could bear the same testimony. We who have 
listened to the counsel and the words of wisdom that flowed from that 
great man's heart have felt that we were in the presence of the spirit of 
Christ. 

His life was gentle, and the elements 
So mixed in him, that nature might stand up 
And say to all the world, "This was a man!" 

All that has been said of the late President Charles H. Hart and 
Judge Franklin S. Richards I indorse with all my heart. 

INSPIRED APPOINTMENTS 

President David O. McKay has been elevated to the high position 
of second counselor in the First Presidency. His remarkable training 
in the Church indicates "there's a divinity that shapes our ends." One of 
the best things that can be said about him is that his religion made him. 
David O. McKay is a chivalrous Christian gentleman. 

When I think of the selection of President Alonzo A. Hinckley to 
the office of an Apostle, the words of the Lord come to me : "Behold an 
Israelite indeed in whom is no guile." I have labored with this fine man 
in the mission field. I know his worth. His aim in life, wherever he is, 
is to work for the glory of God. And let me say in public what is in 
my heart, that President Grant was certainly inspired in appointing these 
men, and also in appointing that good and able man, President LeGrand 
Richards, to succeed me as President of the Southern States Mission. 

THE VALUE OF THE SCRIPTURES 

The Lord said : "Search the scriptures, for they are they which 
testify of me." In some of the current literature there is manifested a 
spirit to make light of, belittle and even ridicule the holy scriptures. The 
Bible is undervalued. Slurs are cast upon the inspiration of the word 
of God. But it is heartening to know that the eclipse of faith is not total. 
The people generally are not underestimating or undervaluing the scrip- 
tures — those true riches given to mankind. God has not left himself 
without witness. 

The British Museum recently purchased for over half a million 
dollars a fourth century manuscript of the Bible, one of the only two of 
that era known to exist. This is the greatest price ever paid for a book. 
It is one of the most notable events of history. The purchase of this 
precious biblical treasure shows a rare sense of value that the English 
people place on the Bible. It is a never-dying book. It is read by more 
people every year. Books may come and books may go, but the Bible 
goes on forever. 

ORIGIN OF ANESTHETICS 

Dr. Crawford W. Long, of Georgia, was the first man in history, as 
far as known, to make use of the anesthetic in ether. He was one of 
Georgia's most distinguished citizens and one of the world's greatest 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 



105 



benefactors. The idea of producing insensibility to pain by surgical 
anesthesia by the inhalation of ether was first put into practice by this 
physician March 30, 1842. 

In Statuary Hall, beneath the great dome of the Capitol in Wash- 
ington, stands the statue of Dr. Long. On the base of it a quotation from 
the reverent physician reads as follows : "I regard my profession as 
a ministry from God." 

In Genesis 2 :21 we read that "The Lord God caused a deep sleep to 
fall upon Adam and he slept : and he took one of his ribs and closed up the 
flesh instead thereof." A skeptic compared this verse and the succeeding 
one to a fairy tale, but Dr. Crawford W. Long declared that it was while 
reading this very passage in Genesis that the idea of the anesthetic ether 
occurred to him. Could such a boon to humanity come from a fairy 
tale ? 

THE SAVIORS SPOKEN WORD 

Dr. John Watson in "The Life of the Master" says : "Were a parch- 
ment discovered in an Egyptian mound, six inches square, containing 
fifty words which were certainly spoken by Jesus, this utterance would 
count more than all the books which have been published since the first 
century." In fulfilment of the prophecy of Isaiah and also other proph- 
ets, the ancient record of nations long since dead, who dwelt on this the 
American continent, was taken from the hill Cumorah by angelic direc- 
tion Sept. 22, 1827. The contents of this, record were translated by the 
prophet Joseph Smith by the power of God and the aid of the Urim and 
Thummim, and the Book of Mormon is the fruit of this translation. The 
history of the men and women on this continent ages ago was shrouded 
in seemingly impenetrable darkness, but God said: "Let there be light," 
and there was light. 

The Book of Mormon contains more than fifty words which were 
certainly spoken by the resurrected Lord, for after his ascension into 
heaven he appeared to his people on this continent and gave them the 
true points of his doctrine. He established his Church on American 
soil and placed within the Church organization prophets, apostles, pas- 
tors, teachers, etc. He brought peace to the laboring conscience, eye- 
sight to the blind, and granted the prisoners of sin sweet relief through 
repentance. The Redeemer healed the sick. He restored unto the 
people the joy of his salvation and blessed them with the precious gift of 
the Holy Ghost. 

The Latter-day Saints most surely believe, and know for a certainty 
that the Book of Mormon contains words certainly spoken by the Son 
of God. 

If any man will do the will of the Father he shall know that the 
Book of Mormon is true. Moroni gives this promise to all men : "And 
if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, 
he will manifest the truth of it unto you by the power of the Holy 
Ghost. And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth 
of all things."

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



DIVINITY OF CHRIST APPARENT 

When men speak disparagingly of the divinity of Christ there is a 
great deal of affectation in what they say, because they cannot help but 
see the nobility, godliness and sacredness of the Savior's life. Sooner 
or later these scoffers will come to themselves. Without Jesus Christ 
there would be no hospitals, paintings, sculpture, or any of the arts 
or real science. For all those who have contributed to the culture, happi- 
ness and instruction of mankind have received their inspiration from 
the Redeemer. And when modernists have sought to bury the divine 
Christ beneath a mountain of modernistic chaff, behold, the cry is heard 
throughout the land "Christ is risen." 

Only a few months ago many of the leading journals in the world 
paid a fabulous price for the right to publish "The Life Of Our Lord," 
by the celebrated Charles Dickens. God has not and never will leave 
himself without witness. Dust storms of criticism may arise and meteors 
may fall about us, but the grand constellations in God's heavens, display- 
ing his power, still burn there, a perpetual witness to every soul beneath 
the spangled heavens that Jesus is divine. In the lives of men whom we 
love for their uprightness, the ideals of the Savior are finding expression. 
More men and women, and they would be the best of Adam's race, would 
die for the Son of God, who gave all for us, than for any other cause 
under the spacious firmament. 

RAYS OF LIGHT HARNESSED 

In Job 38 :32, 33, we read : "Canst thou guide Arcturus with his 
sons?" Arcturus is a far-off star, of the first magnitude, one of the 
brightest in the entire heavens. It supplied the current to start the illu- 
mination of the grounds of the Century of Progress Exposition. Well, 
over a year ago science accepted this God-given challenge, — and through- 
out the scriptures God is challenging science to come up higher and devise 
ways and means for the amelioration of the state of mankind. Science, 
true science, is nobly responding to this challenge. 

More than forty years ago, according to astronomers, Arcturus threw 
off a beam of light which has been on its way ever since, arriving in time 
to start the World's Fair in Chicago. Think of that light beam which 
has been traveling through millions of miles of space for the last forty 
years. Scientists, so we are told, constructed "delicate electrical mechan- 
isms and installed them in astronomical observatories which transformed 
the beam of light into current to be transmitted over special wires to 
Chicago to throw the master switch and illuminate the grounds of the 
Century of Progress Exposition." Thus scientists harnessed and used 
this ray of light, one of the sons of Arcturus, to put the grounds of the 
World's Fair in a blaze of glory. The works of God are wonderful. 

RAYS OF LIVING LIGHT 

I testify to you, my brethren and sisters, that rays of living light 
have come down out of heaven — rays of pre-existence, which throw a 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 



107 



flood of light upon the origin of mankind ; rays of a glorious resurrec- 
tion, and the eternity of the marriage covenant, which destroy the sting 
of death and the victory of the grave. Moreover, there have come the 
rays of faith in the true and living God and his Son ; repentance, which 
means a change of heart ; baptism by immersion for the remission of 
sins, which baptism foreshadows the glorious truth that we shall rise from 
the dead "in the likeness of his resurrection", the gift of the Holy 
Ghost which angels enjoy, which enables us to say "so nigh is grandeur to 
our dust, so near to God is man." Angels speak by the power of the 
Holy Ghost. 

The Almighty created an instrument in the world to receive these 
rays of living light, and Joseph Smith was the foreordained instrument 
placed on the earth by divine wisdom to receive this glorious light. 
Through the Priesthood, by the preaching of the plan of salvation, these 
beams of light have been transmitted to the uttermost parts of the earth 
and the hearts of men and women are ablaze with the light of the ever- 
lasting Gospel. 

The mission of the Church is to prepare the world for the second 
coming of the Son of God. With countless millions who, with stream- 
ing eyes, are praying for his glorious advent, I pray: "Surely I come 
quickly. Even so, come, Lord Jesus." Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem, "Great is Jehovah," solo by Sister 
Margaret Hewlett. 

Elder Don B. Colton, President of the Eastern States Mission, 
offered the closing prayer. 

Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock p. m. 

THIRD DAY 

AFTERNOON MEETING 

The closing session of the Conference convened at 2 o'clock Sunday 
afternoon, October 7. 

Once more the Tabernacle was crowded to capacity, and thou- 
sands who could not find accommodation in that building assembled in 
the Assembly Hall and on the Tabernacle grounds, where they listened 
to the Conference proceedings as they were broadcast by radio from 
the Tabernacle. 

The opening number was a sacred solo, "The Publican," by Sister 
Jessie Williams. 

Elder Elias S. Woodruff, President of the Western States Mission, 
offered the invocation. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

It is four years ago since Evan Stephens became sick while at con- 
ference, returned to his home, and passed away. We will now sing his 
anthem, "Let the Mountains shout for joy."

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



I feel that we owe a deep debt of gratitude to Evan Stephens, 
George Careless, Joseph J. Daynes, and many others, for the splendid 
music they have prepared for our hymns and our anthems. 

The choir then sang the anthem, "Let the mountains shout for joy." 

ELDER RULON S. WELLS 

Of The First Council of the Seventy 

I desire at the beginning to express my delight in the selection of the 
men who have been chosen to fill the vacancies occasioned by the death 
of President Anthony W. Ivins, of the First Presidency, and Brother 
Charles H. Hart, of the First Council of Seventy, and also in the filling 
of the vacancies occasioned by the promotion of our brethren in the 
Council of the Twelve and in the First Presidency. I love these men, as 
I do all of, the General Authorities of the Church. I have always sus- 
tained them ; I have personally known them for many years. 

Two of the brethren who have been thus chosen have been, my inti- 
mate missionary associates ; Elder David O. McKay and Elder Alonzo 
A. Hinckley were fellow missionaries with me in the European Mission. 
I rejoice in the honor that has come to them and feel in my heart to 
uphold and sustain them, and ask God's blessing upon them. 

At the opening of this morning's session of the conference the 
choir sang : "An Angel from on High," and that led me to thinking 
of the mission of the angel Moroni, and of the scriptures which foretold 
his coming; when to John, on the Isle of Patmos, the visions of the 
future were opened unto his mind, as expressed in this quotation from 
Rev. 14 \6,7: 

And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, h'aving the everlasting 
gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and 
kindred, and tongue, and people, 

Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of 
his judgment is come; and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the 
sea, and the fountains of waters. 

As I contemplated this oft-repeated passage of scripture, many 
thoughts came into my mind. 

I have just been attending the German conference in the Assembly 
Hall, and as I realized that these Swiss and German Saints, whom I was 
addressing in their own language, had been gathered here in response 
to the message of that "Angel from on high," I gave expression, in part, 
to these thoughts ; but I desire to still further give expression, during 
the few moments that I have before me, to the thoughts that came 
to me in contemplating that wonderful message to the world. 

First of all, it is the promulgation of this Gospel, that it is to go to all 
nations, kindreds, tongues and peoples that dwell upon the face of the 
earth. This Gospel message — not a new Gospel, but the everlasting 
Gospel, the Gospel that was proclaimed from the very beginning of the 
world unto the children of men — that same everlasting Gospel must 
be carried to all of the various nations of this earth. 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS 



109 



That is some work to accomplish, the fulfilment of that prophecy, 
which prophecy must be fulfilled by carrying the Gospel to every nation. 
We are told in a revelation given to the Prophet Joseph Smith (Doc- 
trine and Covenants, Sec. 90:11) that the time is to come when every 
man shall hear the fulness of this Gospel in his own language and in 
his own tongue. Think of the immensity of that work, what a prodigi- 
ous undertaking it is to carry the Gospel to all the various nations, and 
that too in their own language. 

We have made some headway, but there are many nations that 
have not heard the word of the Lord, the Gospel in its fulness and purity 
as it has been restored in this day and age by the coming of that mighty 
angel which John the Revelator saw flying in the midst of heaven. 

There is one country alone with its 163,000,000 people speaking a 
foreign tongue, and probably many dialects of that tongue. The Gospel 
in its purity has not been preached to them. The scriptures have not 
been translated — those that were given to the Prophet Joseph Smith, the 
Book of Mormon, and many others in defense of the faith and explain- 
ing the Gospel in its purity have not been brought to the understanding 
of that people. Many of the children of Israel are there and must hear 
the Gospel and be gathered into the fold. And there are also other 
nations to whom likewise this Gospel must be| preached. I merely men- 
tion this as an illustration of the prodigious work that lies before us in 
carrying the Gospel to every nation, kindred, tongue and people. 

We must not forget that when it first came to us it came engraven 
upon golden plates uncovered by the Angel Moroni, for : 

Lo ! in Cumorah's lonely hill 
A sacred record lies concealed 

This record, containing the fulness of the everlasting Gospel, was 
engraven upon the plates of gold in a foreign language, which no one un- 
derstood but which nevertheless was translated by Joseph Smith, through 
the gift and power of God, into the English language. How fortunate 
for us that we were born in a country where the English language is 
spoken and that we have the privilege of hearing it in "our own tongue, 
in our own language." Well this same privilege must come to "every 
nation, kindred, tongue and people" before the words of that prophecy 
can be fulfilled. By whom shall this Gospel message be delivered to the 
nations ? Surely by those to whom it has been committed — by the Lat- 
ter-day Saints. — None others. And for this we must prepare ourselves 
by learning their languages and translating into them the written word. 
And what is the message we have to bear? We must declare the 
restoration of that everlasting Gospel through the coming of holy beings 
from the realms above — declare that the Church of Jesus Christ has 
again been set up on the earth and has been endowed with power from on 
high — even the power of the Preisthood, which gives to men the authority 
to administer the saving ordinances of the Gospel. 

There are two methods by which the Lord endeavors to save his 
people and bring them to a knowledge of the truth. One of these methods 



110 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



is based upon fear and the other upon love. Both are good and the Lord 
employs them both. 

There is much wickedness in the world, for "the earth is denied un- 
der the inhabitants thereof," and the warning voice must be given: 
"Fear God and give glory to him for the hour of his judgment is come," 
calling upon all men to repent and be baptized and be warned that the 
time is drawing near when the judgments of the Almighty shall be 
poured out upon the nations, "when sin and iniquity shall be banished 
from the face of the earth, and righteousness shall predominate and 
cover the earth, even as the waters cover the mighty deep." That is the 
warning that goes out. It is based upon fear, it is wholesome fear, 
and all the nations who give heed and listen to that everlasting Gospel 
rendering obedience to it, shall escape the judgments. 

But there is still another method given which is based upon love. 
First let me say of the wickedness — and there is much of it in the world — 
some people have said, and tried to shift the responsibility upon nature, 
that men are by nature sensual and devilish. I wish to challenge that 
statement. I do not believe a word of it. It is not true ; we are not by 
nature sensual or devilish. We are the children of God, and we have 
been formed and fashioned in his image — not only in his bodily image, 
but have been endowed with his divine attributes. We are by nature 
then the children of God, divine, not sensual and devilish. 

We read an explanation of these things in the book of Doctrine and 
Covenants, wherein the statement is made that in the beginning we were 
created in the image of God, and that God gave commandments unto the 
children of men, but through transgression of those holy commandments, 
men became devilish and sensual. (Doc. and Cov., 20:18, 19, 20.) 

But there is a difference in saying that men have become sensual 
and devilish, and saying that they are by nature so. They are not ; they 
are God-like, formed in his image, endowed with his divine attributes. 
The devil is exercising influence over the children of men, and the Lord 
has given us our free agency and freedom of will to think, to determine, 
and to do the thing that we will. Some have made a mistake by imagin- 
ing that the power to do these things is salvation. Nothing of the kind — 
that is free agency. 

We have the privilege of choosing. If we choose to do right, 
it will lead to our salvation, very true. But., if we exercise that freedom 
of will and that free agency in doing evil it will just as surely lead to our 
damnation. 

But we are not by nature vile. I know that many people in the 
world justify themselves by blaming it on to their nature. Poets have 
written so ; even the poet Byron in summing up the character of men, 
after paying his tribute to his Newfoundland dog, pays, a very question- 
able compliment to mankind, in an epitaph he wrote on that dog's tomb- 
stone. Said he : 

Oh man ! thou feeble tenant of an hour, 
Debased by slavery, or corrupt by power, 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS 



111 



Who knows thee well must quit thee with disgust, 

Degraded mass of animated dust ! 

Thy love is lust, thy friendship all a cheat, 

Thy smiles hypocrisy, thy words deceit ! 

By nature vile, ennobled but by name, 

Each kindred brute might bid thee blush for shame. 

I think that is a pretty good explanation of the present condition of 
the world, to a very large extent. But it does not apply to all. There is 
one statement in it that I take exception to, that is : "By nature vile." It 
is not so. Men became vile by transgressing the laws, therefore they 
should repent and be baptized every one of them that they might not be 
overtaken by the judgments of God. 

The other method is based on love. How can we look out into 
this natural world and behold the beauties of nature, how can we look 
into the starry heavens, how can we behold the blazing sun at noonday 
without being impressed with the divinity of God's work? How can 
we contemplate those things without being filled with love for God 
and worship him who made the heavens and the earth and the sea and 
the fountains of water, who made the stars and the sun. He is in the 
sun and is the light of the sun, and is the power thereof by which it was 
made. He is in the stars and is the light of the stars, andi the power 
by which they were made. Worship him ; love him with all your heart. 
Adore him ; think of him grandly as the Creator of the heavens and 
earth and all that in them are. And worship him who made the sea and 
the fountains of water. How can we look upon them without being 
overwhelmed with the goodness of God unto us, for he made the sea 
and the fountains of water. We see the water come trickling down 
the mountainside into the canyon creeks, and from the creeks into the 
rivers, and from the rivers to the sea ; there to be caught up through 
evaporation into the clouds and wafted by the winds back to the moun- 
tain tops to begin its course anew. We may divert those streams from 
their natural channels onto our arid lands and produce an abundant 
harvest, or we may harness them and propel the machinery of the 
world, illuminate our streets, our public buildings and our homes; but 
the water thus diverted seeps back into its natural channels, in its down- 
ward course to the sea and back to the mountains, to feed the ever- 
flowing fountains of water. Surely in these times of drouth we ought 
to appreciate the value of the sea and fountains of water. 

Therefore, worship him in spirit and in truth, and then in the 
abundance of your love for God, keep his commandments, and he will 
surely lead you, not only to escape the judgments which are to come, but 
lead you into the celestial kingdom, to come forth in the resurrec- 
tion of the dead, clothed upon with immortality and eternal life. These 
are the promises of the Father to those who love the Lord and who 
worship him in spirit and in truth. 

Then let us worship the Lord, keep his commandments, and so live 
that we may have part in his glorious work and be numbered among 
those who shall receive the crown of eternal life, I pray, in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

When President Holger M. Larson spoke yesterday concerning 
the work of the Saints and missionaries in the Danish Mission, I 
recalled the time when I wandered through the campus and build- 
ings of the University at Copenhagen. Above the gate of that great 
institution is an eagle sculptured in marble, and underneath an 
inscription in Latin which translated into English says: "The eagle 
is looking toward the celestial light." Every student takes off his 
cap as he passes through the gate, on his way to the lecture hall, 
and he keeps in mind for the day that lovely .thought : "We will 
keep our eyes toward the celestial light." What a beautiful ideal 
for the youth. 

On the 17th of September, 1887, a great celebration was held 
in front of Independence Hall in Philadelphia in honor of the 100th 
anniversary of the adpotion of the Constitution of the United States. 
The President of the United States, Grover Cleveland, and other 
distinguished guests were present on that occasion. A chorus of one 
thousand people rendered the beautiful poem of the German poet Schil- 
ler, entitled "An Appeal to Truth," which had been put to music by 
Mendelssohn. As they sang the lines of the poem: "Upon the divine 
truth of the freedom of man and the knowledge of God, does our civiliza- 
tion stand," the guests stood with bowed heads in gratitude for the bless- 
ings of the Lord. Then President Cleveland arose and among other 
things said : "When we look down one hundred years and see the origin 
of our Constitution, when we contemplate all its trials and triumphs, when 
(ve realize how completely the principles upon which it is based have 
met every national need and every national peril, how devoutly 
should we say with Franklin, 'God governs in the affairs of men,' 
and how solemn should be the thought that to us is delivered this 
ark of the people's covenant and to us is given the duty to shield 
it from impious hands . . . Another centennial day will come, 
and millions yet unborn will inquire concerning our stewardship 
and the safety of the Constitution. God grant that they may find it 
unimpaired." 

Today, there are forces at work to undermine this sacred gift 
of our fathers. These forces are expressed in acts and words of 
disrespect for law, order, and authority. Lord Macaulay feared for 
our democratic institutions, and once expressed the thought that 
institutions purely democratic "must sooner or later, destroy liberty 
or civilization, or both." In reply to this thought of the great Eng- 
lish essayist, we can only say that we hope that the citizens of our 
great republic will have from age to age a finer reverence and 
greater love for the principles of human rights which are set forth 
in the Constitution of our country. 

When our fathers wrote the Declaration of Independence and 
gave us the divine thought : "We hold these truths to be self-evi- 
dent, that all men are created equal ; that they are endowed by 



ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 



113 



their Creator with certain inalienable rights ; that among these are 
life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness," we must ever remember 
that there are no rights that are not duties. The Declaration of 
Independence was not justified if it was not obligatory. So this 
is true with the still greater document of government, the Consti- 
tution of the United States. "There are no rights that are not 
duties." 

The Prophet Isaiah once wrote: "Look unto the rock whence 
ye are hewn," and the ancient Psalmist of Zion warned us when 
he said: "Remove not the ancient land-mark, which thy fathers 
have set." I believe that the life of America depends upon the re- 
ligion of America, and if this our government is to be preserved, 
it will be because America is pervaded, inspired, and controlled by 
the spirit of a faith in Almighty God. Our country was settled by 
people imbued by deep religious convictions. When the Pilgrim 
fathers came and landed at Plymouth Rock in 1620, they drew up 
the Mayflower Compact which in part reads : "In the Name of God, 
Amen. We whose names are written, the loyal subjects of our 
Lord, King James, by the Grace of God King . . . having under- 
taken for the glory of God, and the advancement of the Christian 
faith . . ." "In the name of God" those Pilgrim fathers brayed 
the terrors of the deep to plant homes in America and to establish 
religious freedom. The Quakers came to Pennsylvania, the Catho- 
lics to Maryland, and the Methodists to the Carolinas. James Ogle- 
thorpe who brought colonists to Georgia required that his people 
draw up a form of government based on the fundamentals that were 
given by God to Moses on Mount Sinai: the Ten Commandments. 
This nation must naturally be pervaded by a spiritual life, and we 
have today no more important duty than to inspire the youth with 
a true religious spirit. When the First Continental Congress met 
in Carpenters' Hall in Philadelphia in September, 1774, Dr. Jacob 
Duche was called in to offer prayers, and as he prayed, John Adams 
of Massachusetts tells us that tears "gushed into the eyes of all 
present." This prayer I want to quote to you in full : 

O Lord our Heavenly Father, high and mighty King of Kings, Lord of 
Lords, who dost from Thy throne behold all the dwellers upon the earth, 
and reignest with power supreme and uncontrolled over all kingdoms, em- 
pires and governments, look down in mercy, we beseech Thee, upon these 
American States who have fled to Thee from the rod of the oppressor and 
thrown themselves upon Thy gracious protection, desiring to be henceforth 
dependent only upon Thee. , , , • , f • <r„ 

To Thee have they appealed for the righteousness of their cause, lo 
Thee do they now look up for that countenance and support which Thou 
alone canst give. Take them, therefore, Heavenly Father, under Thy nurtur- 
ing care Give them wisdom in council and valor in the field. Defeat the 
malicious designs of our cruel adversaries. Convince them of the unrighteous- 
ness of their cause, and if they still persist in their sanguinary purpose, U 
let the voice of Thine own unerring justice, sounding m their hearts, con- 
strain them to drop their weapons of war from their unnerved hands in the 
dav of battle. , , ~ ., f 

Be Thou present O Lord of Wisdom, and direct the Council of the 
honorable Assembly. Enable them to settle things upon the best and surest

foundation, that the scene of blood may speedily be closed; that^ order, 
harmony and peace may effectually be restored, and truth and justice, re- 
ligion and piety, prevail and flourish amongst Thy people. 

Preserve the health of their bodies, the vigor of their minds. Shower 
down upon them and the millions they here represent, such temporal bless- 
ings as Thou seest expedient for them in this world and crown them with 
everlasting glory in the world to come. All this we ask in the name and 
through the merits of Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our Saviour. Amen. 

We are right in saying that our government had its beginning 
with a people who had faith in God and his work. After the Ameri- 
can Revolution, people began to cross the mountains to the West, 
and after 1800 they read the Bible and had deep faith in its teach- 
ings. In 1830, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was 
organized as a result of the Priesthood of God which was restored 
from heaven to Joseph Smith. Then came the march across the 
continent, which ended in the settlement of the far West. Metho- 
dists and Presbyterians went to Oregon ; Catholic priests carried 
the message of the Cross into all parts of the northwest ; the 
Latter-day Saints redeemed the desert waste of the Great Basin. 
Every one of the migrations was inspired by the belief that God 
and the message of the Redeemer of the world must be taught to 
the Indians. 

I believe that in the heart of the average American there is 
a deep religious conviction. Our nation has a religious life which 
must be maintained in determining national questions and con- 
trolling national policy. The spirit of mutual respect and good 
will, of justice and peace, of human brotherhood, is the spirit of 
the Christian religion, and this spirit teaches us one and all that 
the object of political activity is not merely to vote or to take sides 
in elections, but to direct our thoughts and deeds to noble actions 
and Christian principles. For this reason, we must educate the 
youth in an understanding of freedom and democracy ; we must 
teach them that the perpetuity of our government depends on a 
deep conviction of the reality of the kingdom of God and the spirit- 
ual quality of life. We Latter-day Saints believe implicitly in the 
kingdom of God and that in time it will be established upon the 
earth with Christ our Lord as King. No more beautiful ideal of 
government can be known than this. The unity of Christianity is 
dependent upon the teachings concerning the kingdom and the life 
of the Savior — the divine birth and the atonement ; the resurrec- 
tion and the assurance that Christ our Lord will come again. In 
this teaching is envisaged the kingdom of God which becomes our 
vision. So America has a dream, a vision, the purpose of which is 
to cause us to understand the spiritual quality of life, for all our 
civilization must be a spiritual achievement. "Look unto the rock 
from whence ye are hewn, and remove not the ancient land-mark 
which thy fathers have set." May the Lord help us to look to the 
rock and to stand by the land-marks of justice, faith, and the 
knowledge of the living God. May the Constitution of the United 
States be preserved and sanctified in the hearts of all Americans. It 



ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 



115 



was George Washington who replied to a question as to whether 
or not the people would support the Constitution. "Let us raise 
a standard," said he, "to which the wise and just can repair ; the 
rest is in the hand of God." 

May we live for the right ; and do what we can to live nearer 
the kingdom of God. May we do everything we can to preserve 
the integrity of the Constitution of the United States. May we 
look toward the celestial light. Amen. 

The choir and congregation joined in singing the hymn, "O ye moun- 
tains high." 

ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

Jesus said : 

Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that receiveth whomsoever I- send receiveth 
me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me. 

And again : 

Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that believeth on me, the works that I do 
shall he do also ; and greater works than these shall he do ; because I go unto my 
Father. * * * * 

He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: 
and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him^ and will 
manifest myself to him. 

Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest 
thyself unto us, and not unto the world ? 

Jesus answered and said unto him, if a man love me he will keep my words ; 
and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode 
with him. 

A LESSON FROM A LIFE SERMON 

I believe that the most powerful sermon any of us shall ever preach 
will be the sermon of our lives. I should like to draw a lesson that I 
feel is needed just now, from the life sermon of President Anthony W- 
Ivins. I recall that one of the most impressive things that touched my life 
was an act of his years ago. If I refer to something that is personal it 
is but to teach the lesson that I should like to present to you. 

Years ago, as a young man, I was active in the same political party 
to which President Ivins belonged. From a convention about the time 
Utah became a state an invitation was sent to President Ivins to accept 
the nomination as Governor of the state. He could have it by unanimous 
vote, but he declined it and turned aside from that very inviting offer 
full of promises and hopes, to accept a call from his Church to break up 
his home in southern Utah and go to Old Mexico and suffer financial loss 
through colonizing in that very difficult place. This act of this man 



116 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



made a more profound impression upon my life than the act of any other 
man," and I owe to him today, by reason of that/ act, most of what I am. 

AMBITIOUS FOR AN EDUCATION 

That is the tribute I want to pay to him, because it was just shortly 
after this that I had graduated from the Brigham Young College at 
Logan and was planning to go East and continue my work at Harvard, 
for I had aspirations and hopes to acquire a higher education. I found 
myself without funds to accomplish that; so, having an offer to teach, 
I accepted it and taught for two years. I thought I could save enough 
to take me through at least a year of school. 

In my second year of teaching there came into my class a very 
charming young woman. I taught her that winter, and she has been 
trying to teach me ever since. 

AN IMPORTANT DECISION 

Two weeks before that school closed and the happy event of our 
marriage was to take place, I received a call from President Wilford 
Woodruff to go with Brothers B. H. Roberts and George D. Pyper to 
open the missionary work in the large cities of the United States. That 
was a crushing blow to all my hopes and aspirations as I had worked so 
long and planned and saved to get the means to continue my education. 
We debated the question but a short time, and before night came the 
answer had gone back, bidding good-bye to our hopes, then, of further 
education; and the means we had saved, which would put us through 
the first year of college, we used on that mission. It is true we got mar- 
ried all right, but she stayed home — the bride of two weeks. That was 
no small trial to me. She volunteered to teach school and assist me in 
the completion of that mission. 

WONDERFUL WOMEN 

I want to pause here to pay tribute to the wives of these General 
Authorities of the Church, and to the wives of you stake presidents and 
you bishops, for these women are all the same kind. No men in any 
part of the world have been blessed with such wonderful women as the 
wives of the men who have been leading and directing the affairs of this 
work. How willing they have been to make their sacrifice, to stand 
in reflected glory and "play second fiddle," and let us go on while they 
perform the great service, often as father and mother in the home. God 
bless them for it. 

DISAPPOINTMENT AND TEMPTATION 

I was not in that mission long, however, until the greatest disap- 
pointment of my life came in the release from the particular work we 
were doing, and an assignment to become a traveling missionary, and it 
came at a time when I was alone. I wept all night about that, and the 
devil tempted me to quit and come home. But I thank the Lord that I 
turned to him for aid and help. Before morning came I had mastered 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 



117 



my own spirit and had written a letter accepting the disappointment. 
It was then I found the song that I have been singing for all these thirty- 
eight years, and which I brought into the literature of the Church. I 
found it in a little book called "Make His Praise Glorious" : 

I'll go where you want me to go, dear Lord; 
I'll be what you want me to be. 

It was like a message from heaven to me, and what a joy it has brought 
to my life to try to live up to the sentiments expressed in it. 

I also recall being impressed when the call came to leave the business 
that I had built up, and that was so profitable, to go out to the North- 
west. I suffered financial loss, and some of my associates thought it was 
foolish. I remarked that had the sacrifice been ten times as great, it 
would be no sacrifice for me to leave it, because I owed the Lord more 
than I could ever pay him if I gave him my whole life. 

I thank the Lord that the example of this man that I have always 
admired, and whose course' and conduct impressed me at that early period 
of my life, has influenced me right through until this day. 

AT HARVARD THIRTY-FIVE YEARS LATE 

I got back to Harvard later but I was thirty-five years late. I was 
installing a mission president and it was vacation time. As I stood 
on the threshold of that great institution I saw myself as I might 
have come thirty-five years earlier, with hopes, with successes that might 
have been; and notwithstanding I appreciate titles and degrees I was 
not disappointed. I saw on the other hand what had happened to me: 
Eleven years as a bishop's counselor and high councilor ; fourteen years 
as a missionary of the Church ; fifteen years as a member of the Council 
of the Twelve — forty years of glorious living ! The joy that had come 
out of it, the honors and the favors of the Almighty, I would not change 
for all the titles and degrees that Harvard offers, much as I admire them, 
if I had to sacrifice for them the joys and the happiness that came to 
me through yielding obedience. 

AN IMPORTANT LESSON 

This is the lesson that I learned : If I do what the Lord wants me 
to do I shall live to fulfil my life in the fullest and the most glorious 
way. I cannot always see what he wants me to do, but he often inspires 
those whom he has called and appointed to direct the labors of my life, 
so that if I am obedient to them and listen I shall come to find myself 
prepared. 

Oh, how grateful I am that when these responsibilities came I had 
had some training for them! How grateful I am for the example of 
President Ivins ! Was it profitable to him? Do you think President 
Ivins ever would have stood in the Council of the Twelve, or as First 
Counselor to the President of this Church, if he had not accepted the call 
of the Lord ? Never ! I wouldn't be standing here today if I had not 
followed his example. I thank God I had strength to do it. 



118 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



NOT BLIND OBEDIENCE 

I am not asking for blind obedience. One day the angel of the Lord 
commanded Adam to build an altar and offer sacrifice, and he did it, not 
knowing why. But on another occasion, when the angel came and said : 
"Adam, why do you do this thing?" he gave that majestic and sublime 
answer : "I know not, save God has commanded it." It was enough that 
the Lord had required the sacrifice. But what did it yield Adam? It 
brought from the lips of the angel the first explanation concerning the 
coming of the Messiah, the Lamb that was to be slain. His obedience 
brought knowledge. I am not pleading for blind obedience, but there 
are two ways by which obedience may be secured. 

It was stated a long time ago by an eminent authority in this coun- 
try, that the two most efficient organizations in the world were the Ger- 
man army and the Mormon Church, but he wished that we might have 
equal efficiency without loss of individual liberty, as he regarded us 
under the domination of the heirarchy that directed us, and assumed 
that obedience was secured here as it was in the German army. 

THROUGH DISOBEDIENCE 

It is true that obedience may be had by force and compulsion. In 
the very beginning, when the Lord desired to know whom he should 
send to represent him here in the earth, who offered themselves ? Two 
glorious sons of God. One was accepted and the other was rejected, 
and the one who was rejected rebelled and was disobedient. I would like 
to say to you that the foundation of all the sorrows and distresses that 
have ever come to men, from the very beginning until this day, have come 
through disobedience. No man commits sin but that he is disobedient 
to the law of God and man. I could name, if time would allow, the men of 
history, even to our own day, who have lost their place and standing in 
the high councils of the Church, through disobedience. 

THE METHOD OF THE CHRIST 

Yes, obedience can be secured by force and compulsion and that 
was Satan's method, but it was not the method of the Christ. Jesus 
Christ had the power to whip the world into absolute obedience in the 
three years of his ministry, if he had only used his power. He had power 
to speak, and not only would the winds and the waves obey his voice but 
they would become his instruments to thrash the nations and bring them 
to their knees through fear. He had the power to speak and the very 
trees would not only wither, but famine could have been spread all over 
the earth. Still, he could speak to the elements and secure food to supply 
his followers. He could not only speak and the dead would come back to 
life, but he could speak and the living would perish. That was his 
power, but he did not use it to bring men to bow down before him, for 
where there was no faith there was no miracle. He would call, persuade, 
in numerous ways be good and kind, but he would not force the human 
mind. 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 



119 



BY FORCE AND COMPULSION 

Contrast the work that went forward under the administration of 
Constantine the Great, who built on the ruins of the church that Christ 
established, that mighty institution that ruled during the long, dark ages. 
That institution was not established by love and gentleness and per- 
suasion, but by the might and the power and the force of Roman arms. 
Nation after nation was conquered and found peace only when they ac- 
cepted Christianity. They gave it but lip service. No wonder the Lord 
Jesus Christ said of this brand of Christians, long afterwards : "They 
draw near me with their mouths, and with their lips they do honor me, but 
their hearts are far removed from me." It was the only kind of worship 
they had known. They had not only been brought within the pales of 
the institution set up under that method and rule, by might and force, but 
by that same force they had been compelled to remain for long ages. 

OBEDIENCE THROUGH LOVE 

What is the method in this Church ? It is obedience through love, 
not obedience through force. We have not known force. What was 
it that prompted the Latter-day Saints to love their prophet and that 
caused them to be so united in following him and his teachings ? I often 
contrast his life with the life of John Alexander Dowie, who also came 
representing himself as a prophet. He performed some miracles and 
secured a following, and then abused their confidence by enriching him- 
self. Later he was rejected and went somewhere else to die, unhonored, 
unwept and unsung. But not the "Mormon" prophet, Joseph Smith. 
He might have asked and received. Everything that his people had they 
would have given to him. But he asked for nothing save the bare neces- 
sities of life, and even these he shared with his friends. They were never 
in any difficulty but that he was at the front, between them and their 
enemies. When his followers were exiled from Missouri he was a ran- 
som. They could go free but he was condemned to lie for months in one 
of the foulest dungeons that has disgraced the foot-stool of God. When 
he realized that he must go somewhere else and find a home for his people 
he started for the Rocky Mountains, where he predicted they would go. 
When he crossed the Mississippi River and was ready to come west the 
word was passed that he was a shepherd deserting the flock. It stung him 
to the quick. Had he ever deserted the flock ? Never. He might have 
snapped his fingers at all his enemies and been free. He surrendered 
and went back. He not only went to his flock but he went to Carthage 
and drew the fire from their heads upon his own until he gave his life. 
The very last act of his life, after the mob had assailed that prison and 
had slain his beloved brother Hyrum, was to walk to that open window 
from whence the bullets of the mob had been coming— and he knew it 
was certain death — but he saved two of his beloved brethren, John Taylor 
and Willard Richards. So that from the beginning of his life to the last 
act he was giving himself for his friends, and "greater love hath no 
man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends." 



120 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Do you wonder that we love him? We do not worship him. We 
regard him as one of God's greatest prophets, and his successors down 
to this day have had that same spirit in their hearts. I know it is in 
the heart of President Heber J. Grant. I know that the only motive that 
dominates his life is to do the will of God and to serve this people. 

THE WILL OF THE MAJORITY 

There is a principle lying at the very foundation of this Church, and 
it is at the foundation of this government as well, for in the laying of the 
foundation of this government it was conceded that it would be impossible 
for us to go forward unless it was agreed that the will of the majority, 
expressed in law, must be regarded as the rule governing the conduct of 
the minority as well. Hence our Constitution came into existence. 

It is so in this Church. No man is muzzled. President Grant does 
not muzzle his brethren. He seeks for all the light and wisdom that they 
have. But there is also a rule that when we reach a conclusion the 
decision of the majority obtains, and it is the duty of the minority, either 
in the government or in this great American church that is also builded 
upon this 1 same glorious principle, that we obey the will of the majority 
expressed in law. 

FIRST GREAT LESSON IN AMERICANISM 

I remember that the first great lesson in Americanism I received was 
in the first great campaign under statehood in Utah, when we were in 
a presidential election. I recall how my father, a leader of one of the 
parties here, had been urgently recommending and doing everything in his 
power to get his candidate elected, but he was defeated. I recall the 
practice of my father to always pray as earnestly for the President of the 
United States as for the President of the Church. Now, the morning 
of the inauguration of this successful president, who was not my father's 
candidate, it was my father's turn to pray and I was watching. But to 
my astonishment he prayed more earnestly for that man than he had 
ever prayed for a president before ; and I said : "Father, you surely for- 
got yourself this morning. You did not intend to pray for that fellow. 
You did not vote for him. You did not want him. You thought your 
man would be a better president." He said : "I certainly did not forget. 
It is true I thought my man would have been a better president, and I still 
think so, but the majority of the people did not agree with me ; and the 
majority of the people having spoken he is now my President, and I am 
going to support him as though I had voted for him ; and pray for him, 
yes. And he will need my prayers much more than the other fellow 
would have needed them." 

SATAN ON THE ALERT 

I say it was my first great lesson in Americanism, and it is a lesson 
I should like the Latter-day Saints today to bring to their homes. We 
are in a period of peace, so far as the Church is concerned, but the enemy, 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 



121 



who has fought us by bonds and imprisonment and martyrdom, has not 
quit the fight. Oh, if he could get a wedge between the people and their 
leaders, get us to quarreling, get us to disregard that principle that 
has brought us all the success that we have ever had, from the very 
beginning, the principle of union and obedience, — if he could do this 
it would be his great pleasure. Don't you let him fool you. I know there 
are some who think : "Oh, if President Young were only here, or Presi- 
dent Taylor, or President Joseph F. Smith, they would do so and so." 
Here is another principle the Latter-day Saints must learn : to follow your 
living leader. "Whomsoever I the Lord appoint ye shall accept," the 
Master said. "And whosoever receives whom I send unto you, receives 
me and receives the Father." 

THE MAN FOR THE TIME 

Every man who has presided over this Church had a mission, a 
destiny, and he performed it gloriously, but he was the man for the 
time. President Young could scarcely have endured what President Tay- 
lor did, and President Taylor would have found it almost impossible 
to carry the Lord's program through as the meek and mild President 
Woodruff did. Likewise on to this day, every man for his time, and the 
Lord knew what he wanted done in the next program of the Church. 

No man — and I say it with all regard and respect for the men who 
have presided in the past — no man, in my judgment, of all these glorious 
men, could have served this people and done God's work better at this 
time than President Heber J. Grant has done it. He is the man for 
this time — progressive. You young people who think he is not, go study 
the history and you will find that he has been one of the most progressive 
presidents this Church has ever had. He has conducted it through its 
greatest building program. May the Lord preserve his life until he has 
filled to the uttermost his mission. It isn't filled yet. And then the 
Lord will raise up another, for this is his work and it is mightier than 
man's. 

BLESSINGS AWAIT THE FAITHFUL 

God bless us, that we will stifle that spirit that would criticise and 
find fault. Some of you may be disappointed, that you were not called 
into the Council of the Twelve. There are hundreds of men in this 
Church worthy, if the Lord would call them, to fill these places. The 
Lord called the right men. I know it. You brelhren, take peace and 
comfort. Whatever disappointments may come, still be true to him and 
I promise you, in the name of the Lord, that if not in time, in eternity, 
you shall have like honors and glory and privilege. If you are faithful 
over a few things here, you shall be ruler over many things there, and 
become kings and priests unto God. And you sisters who have dwelt 
in reflected glory will shine in your own light, queens and priestesses 
unto the Lord forever and ever. 

God help us to be loyal to each other, loyal to the cause, obedient 
to the counsels of those whom God calls to direct us; and the enemy 



122 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



who has sought to destroy us shall be no more successful in new methods 
than he was through bonds and imprisonment and mob violence. 

IN THE HANDS OF GOD 

Don't worry about the future of the Church. It is in the hands 
of the Almighty. Don't worry about the future of the Government. 
That, too, is in the hands of God, and he will guide it and direct it aright, 
and carry it forward until it, too, shall find its glorious mission. God 
speed his cause on. Wars, yes, and bloodshed will come, and thrones will 
totter, but out of every conflict will come the onward progress of 
truth and righteousness in the preparation of this world for its golden 
age, for the coming of the Son of God ! 

God help us to be true under every trial, I pray, in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir and congregation then sang two verses of the hymn, "The 
Spirit of God like a fire is burning." 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I rejoice exceedingly in the very splendid conference we have had. 
I feel very grateful to the Lord, beyond my power of expression, for 
the great blessings poured out upon us during our conference. 

I am indeed grateful that in these times of distress there has been a 
remarkable increase in the tithes of the Latter-day Saints. Although 
I am sure that the actual income of some of the people has not been any- 
where near what it was three years ago, yet our tithing is better than it 
was three years ago. "By their fruits ye shall know them." 

BLESSINGS COME THROUGH ATTENDANCE AT MEETINGS 

There is an increase in the attendance of the people at meetings. 
There is nothing that causes the people to grow more in the Gospel than 
attending their meetings. There is nothing that is more calculated to 
cause the spirit of the Gospel to dry up, figuratively speaking, than to 
stay away from our meetings. When we are in a meeting we partake 
of the spirit of that meeting. When we are absent from it and somebody 
tells us of the wonderful spirit that was present and what was accom- 
plished by being there to partake of it, we cannot appreciate those things. 
It is very much like the man who was hungry and someone told him of 
a fine dinner, but he did not appreciate that dinner. We have to eat for 
ourselves, we have to live for ourselves, we have to be in the line of 
our duty in order to partake of the Spirit of the Lord, if the Spirit of 
the Lord is manifest. 

I call to mind that a brother who lost his standing as an apostle was 
a very, very poor attendant at the meetings of the Council of the Twelve, 
other matters occupied his attention. Francis M. Lyman had to come 
from Tooele the night before our meeting and spend one night here and 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



123 



all day in order to be at the meetings of the Presidency and Apostles 
which lasted two or three hours, but he never missed one of them. 

I said to him one day: "It is remarkable to me that you are so 
prompt and always present at our meetings." 

He said : "I do not want to miss any inspiration from the Lord ; I 
do not want the Spirit of the Lord to come to me second hand. I want 
to partake of it, and to feel it, and to realize it, and to know it for 
myself." 

RICHARD W. YOUNG'S EXPERIENCE 

Speaking of not being there to partake of the Spirit, I am reminded 
of an incident in the life of my nearest and dearest friend, Richard W. 
Young. Richard had graduated from West Point and had gained a 
knowledge of law while stationed at Governor's Island, and attending 
the Columbia university and graduating from that institution. After he 
had graduated he was chosen by Gen. Hancock, because of his admira- 
tion for the studiousness of the young man, to be a major on his staff. 
I took some pride in looking out of a window on Broadway at the four- 
mile-long procession which was the funeral of President Ulysses S. 
Grant, and seeing a grandson of Brigham Young riding on horseback 
at the head of the funeral procession with Gen. Hancock and others. 
The general made him judge-advocate-general of the eastern department 
of the army. But Hancock died and another Pharaoh arose who did not 
know Joseph, so Richard fell back to first or second lieutenant, I have 
forgotten which. 

He came home for his vacation, and he said to me : "Now, Heber, 
I took the advice of President Taylor at your suggestion, and instead of 
resigning years ago in order to get a legal education I stayed in the 
army. Now I have my legal education. There are more lieutenants in 
the army than they want, and they would like me to resign, with the un- 
derstanding that I will volunteer if there is trouble. I do not want to 
ask President Taylor, but I wish you would plead my cause for me at the 
meeting next Thursday in the Endowment House, and Uncle 'Briggie' 
has promised to do the same." 

We two pleaded his cause and some others also, and not a word was 
said in favor, of his staying in the army, but after we had got through 
pleading, President Taylor said : 

"Tell that young man it is the proper time for him to stay in the 
army." 

Richard was in Logan at the time. His aunt, Mrs. George W. 
Thatcher was entertaining his friends in his honor, and he received my 
telegram reading, "Stay in the army," just as they were about to sit 
down to dinner, and it took his appetite away completely. 

ASKS FOR REASONS 

When he returned to Salt Lake City, he said : "What were the 
reasons why I am to stay in the army? What arguments were given ?" 



124 GENERAL CONFERENCE 



"None. All the arguments were for you to resign. President Tay- 
lor said, 'Stay in the army.' " 

"Well, I would like some reasons." 

"You cannot have them, as none was given. You got your educa- 
tion for nothing by following his advice. I think you should do it 
again." 

"Oh, my gracious, I am going to do it, but I would like some rea- 
sons." 

I said, "Well, I cannot give you any. If you had been there, if you 
had felt as I did when President Taylor spoke, you would have felt as I 
felt it in my heart, that he was right." 

Richard went East and met one of his classmates who said : "Where 
are you stationed, what is your place?" And he told him. 

MAKES CHANGE 

The other man said : "Lucky dog ! You had the best station in the 
whole army — Governor's island — and now you have got another good 
one, and I have to go away out in the wild and woolly west to Salt Lake, 
to Fort Douglas." 

Richard said : "I would just as soon change with you if the Secre- 
tary of War will consent." 

So they wrote and asked for a transfer and got it, and Richard 
returned, went up to Fort Douglas, with a street car running every ten 
or fifteen minutes, came down to the city, and went into LeGrand 
Young's office — he could not go into court of course — and got through 
the four years of starvation period as a young lawyer. 

I happened to be in the President's office one morning and I saw 
in the morning paper that Richard's four years at Fort Douglas were up, 
and it told where he had to go. 

President Taylor said : "Heber, I see your young friend, Richard 
Young, is going to leave Fort Douglas." 

"Yes." 

"Well, you tell him that he is released now, and it is time for him 
to stay home." 

SACRIFICING PERSONAL AMBITIONS 

There have been experiences in my life during the last fifty-three 
years, from the time I went to Tooele, illustrating the benefits that come 
through obedience, the benefits that come when we sacrifice our per- 
sonal amibitions for that which we feel in our heart is our duty. Like 
Brother Ballard, I had an over-weening ambition for a university edu- 
cation and a degree from a great school. I had very little hope of ob- 
taining it, having no means and having a widowed mother to look after. 

I met President George Q. Cannon, then our delegate to Congress, 
and he said : "Would you like to go to the naval academy, or to West 
Point?" 

I told him I would. 

He said: "Which one?" 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 125 



I said: "The naval academy." 

"All right. I will give you the appointment without competitive ex- 
amination." 

For the first time in my life I did not sleep well, I lay awake nearly 
all night long rejoicing that the ambition of my life was to be fulfilled. 
I fell asleep just a little before daylight; my mother had to awaken me. 

I said : "Mother, what a marvelous thing it is that I am to have an 
education as' fine as that of any young man in all Utah. I could hardly 
sleep, I was awake until almost daylight this morning." 

I looked into her face, I saw that she had been weeping. I have 
heard of people who when drowning had their entire life pass before 
them in almost a few seconds. I saw myself an admiral in my 
mind's eye ; I saw myself traveling all over the world in a ship, away 
from my widowed mother. I laughed and put my arms around her, and 
kissed her and said : 

"Mother, I do not want a naval education. I am going to be a bus- 
iness man and shall enter an office right away and take care of you, 
and have you quit keeping boarders for a living." 

She broke down and wept and said that she had not closed her 
eyes, but had prayed all night that I would give up my life's ambition 
so that she would not be left alone. 

We all have temptations, we all have things come into our lives 
which iii we give them proper consideration we will reject. 

Brother Ballard has referred to the invitation that was sent to Presi- 
dent Ivins to accept the nomination as governor of the state of Utah, 
which reminds me that a telegram came to me from Ogden at that time 
asking me where they could find Anthony W. Ivins. It said, "We will 
nominate him by acclamation to be the first governor of the state of 
UtahJ or the first representative to Congress." 

I answered to the effect that he was on the Kaibab mountain and 
had accepted a call to go to Mexico. Nothing in the world would cause 
him to fail to fulfil that call. 

I received another telegram telling me that they could not nominate 
me by acclamation, but that they had the majority pledged to me, and 
believed it would be by acclamation before the voting was through. 

I showed the telegram to Heber M. Wells, who had been nomi- 
nated by the Republicans. He said: "Well, my name is 'Dennis', the 
people don't know me. You are sure to be elected." 

I said ; "Well, I am not sure that I am going to run, I will let you 
know later." 

CONFERS WITH PRESIDENT 

I went to President Wilford Woodruff and handed him the tele- 
gram. I said: "How shall I answer that?" 

He said: "What are you bothering me with your affairs for? 
Haven't you got enough inspiration as one of the Apostles to know what 
your duty is ?" 



126 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



I said : "Thank you. If you had wanted me to run, you would have 
said so. Good-bye." (Laughter.) 

I sent a telegram saying: "It will be a personal favor to me if my 
name never comes before the convention." And it never did. 

Do you think I would not like to have been the first governor of the 
State of Utah, where I was born? If you do you are mistaken. I do 
not know of anything that I should have liked better than that at that 
particular time. Thank the Lord I did not get it, because I think that 
perhaps I should have made a failure of it. It was not in my line, it was 
just an ambition. My education, my knowledge of government laws, and 
such things were just thqkind that did not fit nor qualify me to be the 
governor of a state. I thank Brother Woodruff for the inspiration that 
kept me from making a serious mistake. 

ENDORSES REMARKS 

I endorse with all my heart the remarks that have been made 
here during our conference, but particularly and especially do I 
endorse the remarks of Stephen L. Richards and others who have 
talked about our being honest and not imposing upon the government, 
but maintaining our manhood and our independence and living if nec- 
essary under difficulties, instead of rejoicing that we can get our share 
of the government's funds. 

I regret beyond expression the change that has come over many of 
the people. I went into business with my brother and my cousin-in-law 
way back nearly 50 years ago. We sold $120,000 worth of goods in the 
implement business to farmers. I think I am safe in saying that ninety- 
nine out of a hundred of them were "Mormons," and; $90,000.00 of the 
sales were on time. I have asked many men to guess how much our 
losses were. Some have guessed 5 per cent, some 10 per cent and one 
15 per cent. Our losses were $300 on $90,000 — one-third of one per 
cent. 

That business grew from a little business of twenty-odd thousand 
dollars in capital to $2,500,000.00, and we have cut the capital from 
$2,500,000 to $1,500,000. We have had to charge off a loss of over 
$1,000,000 of farmers' paper. True, a great deal of it is due to the hard 
times, but I want to say to you that that spirit of determination to take 
care of ourselves, to build for ourselves, to be independent, and to be 
sure to meet our obligations, is not so strong today as it was at that time, 
and there is more of a disposition to lie down, figuratively speaking, on 
the government. 

REPUTATION FOR HONESTY 

George A. Lowe tried to sell us his business when we were a little 
institution of $21,000, and I laughed and said: "We could not think of 
such a thing. We haven't any money." 

He said in substance : "I will take your note at a low rate of in- 
terest for the entire purchase price." 

I said : "But we would have no capital to carry on the business." 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



127 



"You do not need any with these Mormons," he said. "I have 
charged every loss from selling machinery to the people in Utah and 
Idaho to what I term 'farmers' paper' ; I have charged all the interest 
I have paid to 'farmers 'paper' ; I have credited the notes and the interest 
that come in to my 'farmers' paper' ; I borrowed from McCornick's Bank 
every dollar with which to carry it. I have not put up a dollar and I have 
got all my money back and in addition $2 and a few cents on every hun- 
dred — the difference between the interest that I have collected and the 
interest that McCornick's charged me. 

"He will credit you for all the paper that you take from these farm- 
ers, because he knows it is worth one hundred cents on the dollar." 

I remember that Howard Sebree asked us to buy his business for 
$60,000. I told him we did not have the money. 

He said : "Go over and tell McCornick that you would like $60,000 
credit to buy me out and he will let you have the money." 

I laughed, but went to McCornick's as a joke. He let the company 
have the money and we bought Sebree's business. We did not lose 
anything on the transaction. 

When I was in England, J. M. Studebaker, the last of that wonder- 
ful quartet of Studebaker Brothers, visited Salt Lake and he was inter- 
viewed by the newspapers. He said that for ten long years Studebaker 
Brothers sold wagons and carriages in Utah to the Mormons on com- 
mission, and during that whole ten years they collected the money for 
every wagon and buggy they had sold. 

The day was, years ago, when to be classed as a good Mormon was to 
be classed as a man who paid his debts. Let us, wherein we may have 
failed in the past to live up to that record, make up our minds that we are 
going to live up to.it again in the future. 

A PERSONAL EXPERIENCE 

Do not go into bankruptcy unless you are forced to do so. My 
nearest and dearest friends pleaded with me to take bankruptcy when I 
was ruined, according to their idea, beyond the hope of recovery. I said : 
"If I live to be a hundred years old, I will not do it. I will go on work- 
ing to pay my debts. If some one knocks me down, I can not help that, 
but," I said, "if a giant tackles me, I will defend myself. And if, after 
a hundred years, I have not paid my debts, then I will pray to the Lord 
to let me live another ten years in the hope of doing so." 

I was security for a note of a friend of mine, a good Latter-day 
Saint, I thought, and he was going to take bankruptcy. He showed me 
that I would be relieved because the rate of interest had been increased 
without my knowledge or consent. He brought me legal opinions to 
the effect that that released me as endorser. I laughed, and said, "That 
does not make any difference to me. If you do not pay that note, I will." 

There was a loss on that note of $4,700 in the shrinkage of security. 
I said, "I will see you tomorrow." 

I went to the bank. I said, "Now I will give you three of my notes 



128 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



for $900 each if you will renew this note, without my endorsement, for 
$1000 more than the collateral is worth ; and if the man will not do that, 
will you take his notes for $900 payable each year for three years ?" 
They said : "Yes. Either way." 

I went to him and told him to take his choice. He said : "I will not 
do it. If you are foolish enough, when you are not legally obligated, 
to pay that note, that is not my concern. I am going to take bankruptcy. 
You do not have to pay it unless you want to." 

A PROFITABLE TERMINATION 

I said: "That settles it. I will assume it." And I did. And 
what was the result? In the providences of the Lord I changed the se- 
curities on that note, got them to take other securities, and finally sold 
part of the securities that I took off the note and paid part of the note 
with the money that I received, and I kept) $5000 of a certain stock that 
I had only paid $3,250 for, and in the providences of the Lord it paid 
100 per cent cash dividend — $5,000. Afterwards it paid another divi- 
dend, and I made enough to pay that note (instead of losing $4,700) 
and $3,000 or $4,000 additional, inside of two or three years. He took 
bankruptcy and injured his good name and his reputation in the com- 
munity. 

There are those who have been forced into taking bankruptcy. That 
is what it is for. We can not help that. We can not help it if a bigger 
man than we are knocks us down, but we should never lie down and 
ask somebody to step on us. 

CIGARET SMOKING 

It fell to my lot to accompany the choir to Chicago on their recent 
trip. I never saw a cigaret between Salt Lake City and Chicago, or be- 
tween Chicago and Salt Lake City. Every one that I met, railroad 
men and others, was loud in his praise of the choir. Hotel people said 
they had never met such a fine group of young people, people of such 
fine character. To me that was of much more value than their winning 
— as they did — laurels for their singing. 

The presidency of the Liberty stake have sent out a circular for 
ward teachers. I would like to read it all, but I see the time is shorter 
than I had figured on. 

Dr. Hugh S. Cummings, United States Surgeon General, has said: 

If American women contract the smoking habit, as reports now indicate they 
are doing, the physical tone of the whole nation will suffer. The habit harms a 
woman more than it does a man. 

And Dr. D. H. Cress of Washington has written: 

When women take up with this practice of smoke inhalation the race will be 
doomed For both man and wife to be addicts to smoke inhalation is destruc- 
tive of everything that is good. Children born to such a pair had better never 
have been born. 



PRESIDENT HEBER 1. GRANT 



129 



NEED WORD OF WISDOM 

That is pretty serious talk, isn't it? Never in the history of this 
Church have we needed so much as we do today the Word of Wisdom. 
No nation can ever prosper, this nation being no exception, that under- 
takes to pay part of its obligation and to build up the nation by licensing 
the sale of liquor and allowing people to make millions upon millions of 
dollars by selling liquor. I have never felt so humiliated in my life 
over anything as that the state of Utah voted for the repeal of prohibition. 
I do not want to interfere with any man's rights or privileges. I do not 
want to dictate to any man. But when the Lord gives a revelation and 
tells me what is for my financial benefit and the financial benefit of this 
people, because "of evils and designs which do and will exist in the hearts 
of conspiring men in the last days," I do think that at least the Latter- 
day Saints should listen to what the Lord has said. 

Can there be any meaner or more devilish thing than the advertise- 
ment showing cigaret smoke as an engagement ring ? That is the kind of 
advertising cigarets are getting. 

We have a newspaper that does not pay, known as The Deseret 
News. We have to put up money in order to keep it going. It would 
pay tomorrow if we would advertise beer that does not intoxicate, — of 
course that is, white people, but it does intoxicate Indians when they 
drink it. Legally it does not intoxicate, but actually it does. 

MORE DRINKING THAN PREVIOUSLY 

Every one said : "We do not want the saloons to come back." Well, 
they have more than come back. It is said that on Second South street 
today there is more drinking than there was in all the saloons we had 
formerly in the same amount of territory, and it is said there is also as 
much if not more boot-legging than there was before we repealed the 
prohibition law. 

I could not help but feel humiliated when the Latter-day Saints 
knew as well as they knew that they lived that I wanted them to remain 
true to the Word of Wisdom and not vote for the repeal of prohibition. 

A Word of Wisdom, for the benefit of the council of high priests, assembled 
in Kirtland, and the Church, and also the Saints in Zion : 

To be sent greeting ; not by commandment or constraint — 

Some people say : "That is the way I get around it — 'not by com- 
mandment or constraint' — we can do as we please." 

WILL OF GOD 

But what else does it say ? It says "by revelation and the word of 
wisdom, showing forth — " What? "Showing forth the order and the 
will of God." I say to such people, you do not want to know the will of 
God, do you? I think one of the weakest excuses I ever heard of in 
my life is that one — "not by commandment or constraint" — when, before 



130 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



the verse ends, it tells you that it is the will of God, "in the temporal sal- 
vation of all saints in the last days." 

Now, I see there is no time left, so I will ask you, one and all, as 
a favor, every Latter-day Saint within the sound of my voice, to read 
the Word of Wisdom as contained in the Doctrine and Covenants, and 
do it tonight or tomorrow. Do not put it off longer than tomorrow, and 
it will save my reading it and saying any more about it now. 

I thank the Lord for the splendid record made by the choir. 

PRESIDENT YOUNG'S ATTITUDE REGARDING CREDIT 

I intended to bring a letter here to read to you over the signature 
of Brigham Young. I shall publish it in the Conference Pamphlet, and 
shall ask that it be published in The Deseret News, following my remarks 
here, because I have not time to read it now. A firm refused credit 
to Z. C. M. L, and President Brigham Young wrote to the firm and 
thanked them and said that his advice to the people always had been not to 
go in debt. 

This letter from Brigham Young upon which President Grant com- 
mented is printed herewith as follows : 

St. George, Utah. 
March 27, 1877. 

To 

Messrs. Meyer Bros. & Co., 
St. Louis, Mo. 
Gentlemen : 

A few days ago we received from Zion's Co-operative Mercantile Institution 
at Salt Lake City, a copy of your communication of the 3rd inst., in which you 
inform that institution that you prefer to do only a cash business with it hereafter. 

We are thankful to you for giving them this notice. 

It is in exact keeping with our repeated instructions to the officers of that 
institution, to do all their business on the no-credit system. 

If those officers, and all of our people engaged in business would only be 
advised by us they would do their business, and all of it, on the cash-down 
principle and not a dollar on credit. 

We desire to see our people invariably adopt this manner of doing business — 
go with their money and buy where they find they can do so to the best advantage. 
Be self-sustaining in this, as they are in so many other respects. In this course, 
we do not fail to see abundant increase of business thrift and financial prosperity. 

For this reason we most earnestly desire, that all with whom our people of this 
territory do business, would refuse credit ; and thus teach the very useful lesson 
of making them self-reliant and sustaining in their commerical transactions. 

The triumphs of the people in this before-time, so-called desert and forbidding 
wilderness, have been achieved by this very principle of self-reliance, coupled, of 
course, with the blessings of the Almighty. 

We would that the same principle were invariably to rule in all our monetary 
transactions likewise. And, therefore, again thank you for refusing to sell your 
wares on time to Zion's Co-operative Mercantile Institution and remain 
Gentlemen 

Yours Very Respectfully, 

BRIGHAM YOUNG. 

I wish also to compliment the director and the good sisters of the 
Singing Mothers chorus. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT

WORD OF THE LORD TO HYRUM SMITH 

I want to read something that the Lord said to Hyrum Smith : 

Seek not for, riches but for wisdom ; and behold, the mysteries of God shall 
be unfolded unto you, and then shall you be made rich. Behold, he that hath 
eternal life is rich. 

Verily, verily, I say unto you, even as you desire of me so it shall be done unto 
you ; and if you desire, you shall be the means of doing much good in this genera- 
tion. 

Say nothing but repentance unto this generation. Keep my commandments, and 
assist to bring forth my work, according to my commandments, and you shall be 
blessed. 

They were working at the time on the translation of the Book of 
Mormon. 

And now, verily, verily, I say unto thee, put your trust in that Spirit which 
leadeth to do good — yea, to do justly, to walk humbly, to judge righteously; and 
this is my Spirit. 

Verily, verily, I say unto you, I will impart unto you of my spirit, which shall 
enlighten your mind, which shall fill your soul with joy;' * * * * 

Wait a little longer, until you shall have my word, my rock, my church, and 
my gospel, that you may know of a surety my doctrine. * * * * 

Keep my commandments ; hold your peace ; appeal unto my spirit ; 

Yea, cleave unto me with all your heart, that you may assist in bringing to. 
light those things of which has been spoken — yea, the translation of my work ; be 
patient until you shall accomplish it. 

Behold, this is your work, to keep my commandments, yea, with all your 
might, mind and strength. 

Seek not to declare my word, but seek first to obtain my word, and then shall 
your tongue be loosed ; then, if you desire, you shall have my Spirit and my word, 
yea, the power of God unto the convincing of men. 

Now this is the part I want you all to remember : 

Behold I speak unto all who have good desires, and have thrust in their sickles 
to reap. 

Behold I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God, I am the life and the light of the 
world. 

I am the same who came unto my own, and mine own received me not ; 
But verily, verily ,1 say unto you, that as many as receive me, to them will I 
give power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on my name. 

ANY MAN WHO RIDICULES THE SAVIOR 

We are told that agitation is going on in some sections of the coun- 
try in favor of so-called "liberty," which instead of being liberty is any- 
thing but liberty. I do not want to be accused of engaging in politics, 
but let me tell you that if any state in the Union of the United States 
shall elect a man to stand at the head of that state who has ridiculed 
the Savior of the world, it will be as bad as the rebellion of 1861. I lift 
my voice against it, and I am willing to have it said that this is politics, 
if they want to make politics of it. Any Latter-day Saint who sustains 
or votes for a man to be governor of a state who has ridiculed in print 
the Savior of the world, is doing that which I as President of the Church 
hereby condemn.

GENERAL CONEERENCE 



GIVES TESTIMONY 

The time is up, but I am going to say something more. I want it 
distinctly understood that in England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Ger- 
many, France, Belgium, Holland, Switzerland, Italy, Norway, Sweden, 
Denmark, Canada, Mexico, from Portland, Maine, to Portland, Oregon, 
in the Hawaiian Isles, and in far-off Japan, I have lifted up my voice, 
and I want to lift it up here, before closing this conference, to the effect 
that I know as I know that I live that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, 
the Son of the living God, the Redeemer of the world, and that Joseph 
Smith was a prophet of the true and the living God, and that Mormon- 
ism, so-called, is in very deed the plan of life and salvation. 

God help you and me and every Latter-day Saint to prove to the 
Lord by our lives, that our testimony of the divinity of this work is not 
merely lip service. God bless you, and bless all honest men, and defeat 
all men who are working to destroy churches. Roger Babson tells the 
truth when he says we need more religion. God bless every man that 
believes in Jesus Christ and is working for the uplift of mankind, and 
God defeat every man who ridicules the Savior of .the world, the Re- 
deemer of mankind. This is my prayer, and I ask it in all humility, in 
the name of Jesus Christ, our Redeemer and Savior. Amen. 

An anthem, "Then shall your light shine forth," was sung by the 
choir, after which the choir and congregation sang "Doxology." 

The benediction was pronounced by Elder Joseph J. Daynes, Presi- 
dent of the Western States Mission. 

Conference adjourned for six months. 



The singing at the various sessions of the Conference was con- 
ducted by Anthony C. Lund, Conductor of the Tabernacle Choir, as- 
sisted by Albert J. Southwick and Charlotte O. Sackett. 

Accompaniments and interludes on the great organ were played by 
Frank W. Asper and WadeJ N. Stephens. 

Stenographic notes of the Conference were taken by Frank W. 
Otterstrom and Joseph Anderson. 

Joseph Anderson, 
Clerk of the Conference.

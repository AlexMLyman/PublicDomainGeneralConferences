CA ((Jhrilling Story of 
CENTURY ONE OF 
CHURCH HISTORY 

mERE is a new story of "Mormonism," told with a com- 
pleteness and charm that will thrill Latter-day Saints 
with a pride of achievement and at the same time win 
the admiration of the critic, be he friend or foe. In a COM- 
PREHENSIVE HISTORY OF THE CHURCH, B. H. Roberts 
has done a masterful piece of research and has set down the 
record of Century One— 1830 to 1930— in a brilliant appraisal of 
momentous events. The reader with a sentimental interest will 
be fascinated with this narrative of truth stranger than fiction; 
the reader who approaches the new work with the critical vision 
of the historian will find it fair in statement, authentic in fact, 
copious in detail and sound in judgment. 

A COMPREHENSIVE HISTORY OF THE CHURCH was writ- 
ten by Elder Roberts at the instance of the First Presidency of 
the Church, with a commission to make it exhaustively complete, 
from the remotest beginnings to the close of the Centennial 
Conference of April 6, 1930. The final volume ends with an 
account of the Conference itself, making the history technically 
inclusive of all that happened in Century One of the organized 
existence of the Church. Thus it is a fitting commemoration of 
one hundred years of struggle and achievement. 

This monumental work is not to be confused with any former 
history, journal or chronicle. Though its nucleus is the history 
of "Mormonism" published a few years ago in AMERICANA, 
running serially for six years through that magazine, yet this 
History is NEW — new in its wealth of material, new in method 
of treatment and new in its physical representation of the book 
maker's art.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



FIRST DAY 

MORNING MEETING 

The first session of the Conference convened Friday morning, Oc- 
tober 2nd, 1931, at 10 o'clock, with President Heber J. Grant presiding. 

The great tabernacle auditorium and galleries were filled with 
people who had assembled from all parts of the Church. 

President Grant announced that the meeting would commence by 
the congregation singing the hymn "We thank thee, O God, for a 
Prophet." 

After the singing of this hymn, the opening prayer was offered 
by Elder LeGrand Richards, President of the Hollywood Stake. 
The congregation sang the hymn, "O say, what is truth?" 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

It is a pleasure to again have the opportunity of meeting the 
Latter-day Saints in general conference. J rejoice in the progress 
of the work of the Lord. 

It has been my privilege during the last six months since we were 
assembled here in this capacity, to visit quite a number of the stakes 
of Zion and to be in a number of the missions of the Church, and to 
dedicate a great many chapels and recreational halls in different parts 
of the Church. 

Notwithstanding the great trouble financially all over the world 
I believe that as a people we are suffering less than are those in other 
sections of the country, for which I am very grateful to the Lord. 

WORK PROGRESSES 

The work of the Lord is progressing all over the world without any 
exceptions. We are receiving calls from the presidents of all our 
missions for additional missionaries. 

Our missionary force has been reduced very materially on account 
of the present financial condition at home and abroad, but the spirit 
of the work is progressing splendidly, and many of the local people all 
over the world where we have missions are engaged actively in mission- 
ary work; and in many places local people are being installed in 
presiding positions, thus relieving many of the missionaries from some 
of the activities that they have heretofore engaged in. I rejoice in the 
present condition of the Church and the progress it is making. 

iTSTO NEED TO WORRY 

I do not think that we need to worry the least bit about any of 
the Latter-day Saints suffering on account of lack of food or shelter 
during these hard times. I am confident beyond the shadow of a doubt 
that with our system of fast-day donations and the work that is being 
done by our Relief jSociety, the bishops in all ,the various wards, with 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT

the help of the auxiliary officers, will be able to look after those who 
are in real distress. j 

I am converted to the fact that if the Latter-day Saints as a people 
would actually do without two or three meals once a month, as pre- 
scribed, on fast days, and give the full equivalent to the bishop, thus 
benefitting their own individual health and that of their families — if 
they conscientiously paid a full fast day donation, each and every 
person giving the equivalent of two or three meals one Sunday jn each 
month — it would fully take care of those who are in distressed circum- 
stances. 

I rejoice in the fact that from many sections of the country we 
have received reports that our people, as a rule, who have been honest 
and conscientious in the mission field, in the payment of their tithes, 
almost without exception are retaining their employment and are getting 
along all right financially. 

FALSEHOODS BEING CIRCULATED 

I do not know that the subject is worthy of my notice, and yet it 
has been suggested that it might be well to refer to the continued falsi- 
fying by some people who have been excommunicated from the Church 
and are going around distributing papers and documents and publishing 
papers that are as full of lies as an egg is full of meat. I believe that 
the very best liars I have any acquaintance with are those who have 
been cut off from the Church and cast out. They seem to be very active 
at the present time, making statements that our property is being 
mortgaged, etc., notwithstanding the fact that there is no Church prop- 
erty mortgaged. Any person could go down to the county court house 
in any of the counties and find out if the Church's property is mort- 
gaged. There is no part of the property of any one of the wards or 
stakes in our Church, or of the general Church property, that is 
mortgaged. 

These people talk about the funds of the Church having been used 
for individual benefit and so on, so I hear. It is only fair to say 
that I have never taken the trouble to read what they publish in their 
"New Era." It would be more properly named the "Regular Liar," 
instead of the "New Era." I have heard that a lie can travel around 
the world while truth is getting out of bed, but nevertheless truth 
eventually overtakes the lie and steps on it. 

MONEY LOANED TO SUGAR COMPANY 

The fact remains that the Church has loaned some money to the 
Sugar Company and it has taken a mortgage for that money, and the 
loan is well secured. The fact remains that in helping the Sugar Com- 
pany the Church is helping itself, because the first beet sugar factory 
ever built in the iUnited States of America with American machinery 
was built at Lehi, and 'the Church used its credit and borrowed the 
money to help build it. Yes, the Church had to borrow the money

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



at that time. Now it .does not need to borrow it. The Church 
is the principal stockholder in the Utah-Idaho Sugar Company, and by 
lending it some money and taking /security on real estate, it is simply 
protecting its own property. 

PENALIZED FOR LOYALTY 

I shall be very happy indeed if in the providence of the Lord there 
shall be a return of prosperity for ( the Sugar Company. We are being 
penalized today in the sugar business because of the loyalty of the 
people in response to jthe appeals of the Government when sugar was 
retailing at 20, 25 and sometimes 30 cents a pound. We built at that 
time twice as many factories as we can now get beets to operate, and 
I suppose it is just as well that we could not get the beets during the 
last year tar two to operate all our factories inasmuch as there is no 
profit in the business. 

I am sure that whenever the time comes that sugar will sell at rea- 
sonable prices, so that the farmers can get a little more money for 
raising beets, some of our idle factories can be opened, and there will be 
an increase of prosperity for the farmers and the people generally, if 
this industry can only grow and increase. 

PERSONAL PROFIT DENIED 

The original sugar factory was built (by jWilford Woodruff and his 
associates and friends mainly for the benefit of the farmers, so that 
they might have an increased variety of crops. That was the only object. 

The idea that businesses have been established by the Church for 
the individual profit of men who are connected with the leadership of 
the Church is absolutely false. Many of us borrowed money and put 
it into that factory at the request of [President Woodruff and lost the 
money that we invested. 

I know something about it individually because I personally bor- 
rowed a large sum of money, bought stock, paid interest on it for five 
years and then sold the stock for less than one half of what it cost. I 
gained a whole jlot of experience financially out of it and have never 
recovered, so far as the Sugar Company is concerned. II thought I 
would make this much of an explanation. 

SATISFIED WITH ,STATUS 

I remember delivering a sermon here nearly a year ago — perhaps it 
was longer ago than that, I do not remember the exact date — in which 
I referred to the fact that some people had said that if the Mormons 
would only do away with their belief in Joseph Smith and his prophecies 
they might now really, with the progress they are making and the 
changes they are making, etc., be counted in the Christian family. 

Inasmuch as the Church to which you and I belong is the Church 
of Jesus Christ, established by the Savior himself through the instru- 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



5 



mentality of the Prophet Joseph Smith, I do not think we need to worry- 
about being admitted into the various Christian denominations. The 
one thing that you and I need to worry about, and the only thing, is 
with regard to keeping the commandments of the Lord, living our 
religion as Latter-day Saints. 

TRUE LATTER-DAY SAINTS 

I am sure that the man who is honestly and conscientiously observ- 
ing the Word of Wisdom, who is a full and honest tithe-payer, and 
attends to his meetings and his family and secret prayers, such a man 
need not worry about anything that might be said concerning this 
Church by apostate Mormons or anyone else. 

A true Latter-day Saint is living a life that is above reproach. He 
is living a life that stamps him in the eyes of all honest, conscientious 
people as a man worthy of respect and one who can be relied upon, 
because the true Latter-day Saint believes in God and in Jesus Christ, 
the Redeemer of the world. He believes in sustaining the laws of God 
and the laws of his country, and in living a virtuous, true, upright life. 
No man can be a true Latter-day Saint without being worthy of the 
confidence of all men, without regard to whether they believe as he does 
or have any respect for his beliefs. 

CHANGES AMONG GENERAL AUTHORITIES 

There have been some changes made since our last conference. 
As you all know, Brother Orson F. Whitney, one of the Council of the 
Twelve, and Elder Rey L. Pratt, one of the First Council of Seventy 
and president of the Mexican mission, have passed away. They were 
two outstanding preachers of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, men of great 
ability in proclaiming the Gospel and men of great personal inspiration. 
They lived lives that brought honor and respect to them and thereby 
honor and respect to the people that they represented as general officials. 

The Presidency and Apostles have nominated, as you know, al- 
though they have not yet been ordained and set apart, Brother Joseph 
F. Merrill and Brother Antoine R. Ivins to fill the positions made 
vacant by the death of these two stalwart workers in the Church. The 
other changes are as follows : ■

THE FOUNDATION OF THE CHURCH 

Coming back to the suggestion that we as Latter-day Saints do 
away with faith in Joseph Smith, I want to announce, as I stated on the 



•PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



7 



occasion referred to, that the moment any individual or individuals 
shall lose faith in the divine mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith, 
that minute they are not entitled to be called Latter-day Saints. The 
whole foundation of this Church rests firmly upon the inspiration of 
the living God through Joseph Smith the Prophet. 
When I hear the song — 

"We thank thee, O God, for a prophet 
To .guide us in these latter days," 

I never feel as though it applies to me. I never hear it but that I feel 
it applies to that man who was the instrument in the hands of God of 
restoring again to the earth the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, the 
plan of life and salvation, the pearl of great price, that which is of more 
value than everything else in all the world, namely, the plan which if 
you and I live it will bring us back into the presence of God our 
Heavenly Father, to dwell there in joy and peace eternally. 

TRUTH EVIDENCED 

When anybody talks about Joseph Smith not being a prophet he 
should look into the great and remarkable prophecies that he uttered. 
He should read the marvelous and wonderful revelations in the Doc- 
trine and Covenants which the Lord has given to us through him. 
I am sure when people realize that the war of the rebellion was foretold 
and prophesied of by him, and that he gave the world a solution, so to 
speak, of the difficulties which brought about the war, advocating the 
sale of the public lands of the country to purchase the slaves as England 
had done, they must recognize that he was inspired of the Lord. 

PUZZLES WRITER 

I remember very distinctly that in the book entitled "Figures of the 
Past" the man who wrote it said he could not account for Joseph Smith 
and intimated that he must have been partially insane. He said he had 
visited a place where the insane were kept, and I suppose he was on a 
par with the man who said that Joseph Smith received his revelations 
at the time he was in epileptic fits. Joseph Smith was one of the stal- 
warts physically. He was an athlete, a very strong man. 

The wisdom of the wise shall be confounded. This same man 
goes on to say, in paying tribute to Joseph Smith, that of all the men 
he had ever met, Elisha R. Potter of Rhode Island and Joseph Smith 
seemed best endowed with "that kingly faculty which directs as by 
divine right feeble and confused souls looking for guidance." He 
went on to say that great credit had been given to Ralph Waldo Emer- 
son as being a statesman ahead of his day because of his advocating 
the sale of the public lands for the purchase of the slaves ; but he said, 
"What shall we say of the Mormon prophet who advocated the same 
thing eleven years previously, when the heavens were clear and tran- 
quil ?" At the time Ralph Waldo Emerson advocated this course there 
were war clouds in the heavens. 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



SUPERIORITY ADMITTED 

Wje say that Joseph Smith was a prophet of the living God and 
(hat lie gave to the people a solution that would have saved that terrible 
fratricidal war between the Northern and Southern States. 

He goes on to say : 

"Such a rare human being is not to be disposed of by pelting his memory 
with unsavory epithets. Fanatic, imposter, charlatan, he may have been; but 
these hard names furnish no solution to the problems he presents to us. Fanatics 
and imposters are Jiving and dying every day and their memory is buried with 
them ; but the wonderful influence which this founder of a religion exerted and 
still exerts throws him into relief before us, not as a rogue to be incriminated, 
but as a phenomenon to be explained." 

He also says that with hundreds of thousands believing that he is an 
emissary from the Most High God we cannot dispose of him by 
ridiculing his name. 

A MIGHTY PEOPLE 

All the lies that are being told about the people today are as nothing 
in comparison with those that were told about the prophet. He taught 
the people that we would be driven from city to city, county to county, 
state to state and finally beyond the confines of the United States, and 
that we would become a great and a mighty people in the midst of the 
Rocky Mountains. He said the day would come when not only a city, 
a county or a state would be arrayed against this handful of people 
called Mormons, but that the day would come when the whole United 
States would be arrayed against them. 

And we have lived to see these statements fulfilled. We have 
become a mighty people. We have over a thousand wards and inde- 
pendent branches from Canada on the north to Mexico on the south. 
We have more than nine hundred branches in the missions throughout 
the world. We have splendid edifices in our wards and branches from 
Canada to Mexico. We have some magnificent temples that have 
been erected from Canada on the north to Arizona on the south, and one 
splendid temple way off in the Hawaiian Islands. 

The work of the Lord is progressing, the people are growing in 
faith and a love of the truth, in absolute testimony that Joseph Smith 
was in very deed a prophet of the true and the living God. 

DURING THE PAST ONE HUNDRED YEARS 

This Gospel has been proclaimed now for over one hundred years 
all over the world, in every land and every clime where religious liberty 
has been granted, and it has gathered out people from every denomina- 
tion under heaven ; and as I have remarked in my public addresses, I 
know of no missionary in my entire experience, although we have at 
times had more than two thousand in the field, that has ever returned 
to announce that he had found that some other religion, in England, 
in Ireland, or some other part of the world, was the truth, the Gospel 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



Q 



of Jesus Christ. Our missionaries have come home during the past 
one hundred years with increased testimony of the divinity of the 
mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith. 

We have lived to see the issuing of an exterminating order by the 
governor of a state ,to expel the Latter-day Saints ; we have lived to 
see the army of the United States of America, because of the lies of 
runaway judges, come against this people. W!e have lived to see the 
property of the Church both real and personal, confiscated by the highest 
.tribunal, under the acts of Congress ; and I have picked up the paper 
time and time again during the litigation for the return of our property 
and have read in bold headlines, "The United States of America versus 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints," and have laid down 
the paper and thanked God that the United States had placed the stamp 
of divinity upon the utterances of the prophet of the living God. 

EXAMPLE QUOTED 

Stephen A. Douglas, believing absolutely that he had within his 
grasp the presidency of the United States, that he would be over- 
whelmingly elected, presumed to say that we had destroying angels, 
that we were in league with the Indians, that we were in rebellion 
against the government, that we were setting up a kingdom of our own 
here with Brigham Young at the head of it. Then he was reminded by 
The Deseret News that the (Prophet Joseph Smith had said to him when 
he was an obscure country judge: 

"Judge Douglas, the day will come when you will aspire to the presidency 
of the United States, and if you ever lift your voice; against my people you shall 
be disappointed in your ambitions, you shall die a broken-hearted, disappointed 
man, and the conversation of this day will stick to you until the day of your 
death." 

DEFIES STATEMENT 

He defied that statement. When? He defied that utterance of 
the Prophet when he felt sure that he would be elected president, and 
this was at a time when we did not have_a single vote in the electoral 
college for the presidency of the United States. We were a territory 
without a vote and there was no occasion for this man to make the 
speech that he did unless he felt in his heart that he could brand Joseph 
Smith as a false prophet. But instead of branding him as such he 
brought forth one of the strongest evidences of the divine mission of 
Joseph Smith. 

May the Lord bless us during our conference sessions. May the 
light and inspiration of his Spirit attend us. May we, one and all, seek 
every day of our lives to fully live up to the requirements of the Gospel. 
And I can promise you that ,if you do so, peace, prosperity and happi- 
ness physically, intellectually, and,above all, spiritually, will attend you. 
I ask this blessing in the name of Jesus Christ our Redeemer. Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ELDER DAVID O. McKAY 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

I have listened with great interest to the remarks of President 
Grant. He has outlined a course of procedure and attitude of mind 
and spirit which all Israel should accept and follow. 

TRY THE SPIRITS 

Just as my name was announced I was turning the leaves of my 
Bible to find the text: 

"Believe not every ;spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God." 

It is a wonderful thing to be anchored in the truth. W(hen one 
is anchored to a testimony that God has spoken in this dispensation, 
that he has revealed his truth, there is little danger of one's becoming 
moved from one's place by any false theory, or any half truth, or any 
false accusation, that may be brought into his life. All such will affect 
one only as the waves affect immovable cliffs on the shore. But when 
one is not anchored then one becomes easily moved, at least unrestful and 
ill at ease. So it is necessary at all times to try the spirits, to make the 
test. Let the Church, the Gospel of Jesus Christ, be the measuring 
rod. When things do not harmonize with the truths of the Gospel we 
can pass them by, or at least hold them in abeyance until either their 
truth or falsity be established. 

AN EXPERIENCE IN THE MISSION FIELD 

My mind recently has been drawn to the importance of our people 
testing the spirit of slander, of calumny, and I would like to raise my 
voice this morning in warning against such a spirit. It is easy to dis- 
tinguish between the spirit of slander and the spirit of the Gospel. I 
remember an instance in England during my late mission that may 
illustrate my meaning. Two Elders had gone to great expense, for 
them, in procuring a hall, in announcing their meeting, in distributing 
literature, etc. Their hopes were high on Sunday morning when as they 
approached that hired hall, they saw a goodly number of persons ac- 
cepting their invitation. One gentleman who' was dressed in the garb 
of a Christian divine approached the hall and was greeted by the Elder 
who was standing at the door. The latter extended his hand, but the 
minister refused, saying contemptuously, "I did not come here to shake 
hands with you." ; 

"Very well," said the Elder, "you are welcome," and invited him 
into the hall. 

When the Elder reported this to me he said : "I felt somewhat 
discouraged and gloomy." 

I said : "You ought to be very thankful for the experience that 
came to you that morning. That gentleman misjudged you. You 
know he misjudged you. You know your sincerity. You know what 
you had in your heart. You know also that he was wrong in his 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY 



11 



accusation and in his feelings toward you and your people. Test that 
spirit and see if you have not more confidence in the work in which 
you are engaged than you ever had before." 

THE SPIRIT OF SLANDER 

And so, Latter-day Saints, test the spirit of the various accusations 
that are sometimes hurled against our leaders and against the Church. 
We have always had lies, calumny and vituperation to fight and the 
Church of God will always have it. Our only problem is for us to be 
unmoved from our station. 

The scriptures tell us that, 

"Whoso privily slandereth his neighbor, him will I cut off. 
"He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house; he that telleth 
lies shall not tarry in my sight." 

Slander is defined as "defamation whether oral or written." "A 
false report maliciously uttered and tending to injure the reputation of 
another." 

"Slander," says Shakespeare, "whose edge is sharper than the sword; 

whose tongue 
Outvenoms all the worms of Nile ; whose breath 
Rides on the posting winds, and doth belie 
All corners of the world : kings, queens and states, 
Maids, matrons, nay, the secrets of the grave 
This viperous slander enters." 

"Slander is a poison which extinguishes charity, both in the slanderer and 
in the person who listens to it; so that a single calumny may prove fatal to an 
infinite number of souls ; since it kills not only those who circulate it, but also 
all those who receive it." 

Diogenes being asked, "What is that beast, the bite of which is the 
most dangerous?" replied, "Of wild beasts, the bite of a slanderer; 
and of tame beasts, that of the flatterer." 

The source of slander may be found in a depraved nature. It is 
a weed the roots of which find richest sustenance in a soul that is seeking 
to destroy his fellows. In uncultured souls there is a desire to ride on 
the downfall of another — their souls feed on others' failures. 

It was Emerson who said, referring to this depravity in human 
nature, that an accident cannot happen in the street but the bystanders 
will be animated with the faint hope that the victim may die. 

george Washington's experience 

If we look back into history we shall find that great men have 
suffered perhaps more from this evil than from any other one thing. 
I ask you to recall the father of our country. We can think of him 
appropriately on this occasion as the nation will soon celebrate the two- 
hundredth anniversary of his birth. Perhaps the saddest experience of 
his life was at Valley Forge, December, 1777. His army was in 
winter quarters, about twenty-two miles from Philadelphia. He had 
fewer than ten thousand men, three thousand of whom deserted to 
the British.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



"The soldiers were thinly clad, some half naked, others with no clothing, 
hut tattered blankets wrapped around them. So many were sick as the result 
of privation, and so many were without coats, blankets, hats or shoes, that one 
wonders how the army held together at all." 

Under this stress of critical, desperate condition it must have 
seemed to Washington that he was abandoned not only by Con- 
gress, then in session at York, but also by most of his friends as well. 
John Adams had turned against him, so also had Richard Henry Lee. 
General Gates insulted him by sending reports direct to Congress in- 
stead of to Washington, his superior officer. 

As carrions hover around a dying creature, so in Washington's dire 
calamity came men to seek to crush him — men who formed what has 
been called the "Conway Cabal," a contemptible attempt to dishonor 
Washington and to supplant him by a self-asserting, arrogant schemer. 
Falsehoods 'most damnable appeared in print, and lies fell like froth 
from unclean mouths. 

In the midst of all this Washington's imperturbable conduct makes 
his character shine in immortal glory. 

I need not refer to Lincoln who, surrounded by men who attacked 
him, who accused him falsely, towered as Goldsmith has said of another, 

"As some tall cliff, that lifts its awful form, 
Swells from the vale, and midway leaves the storm, 
Though round its breast the rolling clouds are spread, 
Eternal sunshine settles on its head." 

AN IMPRESSIVE INSTANCE IN CHURCH HISTORY 

One of the most impressive instances in all the world of the dire 
effect of calumny we have in the history of our own Church. About 
June, 1844, Joseph Smith, Hyrum Smith and the other leaders of the 
Church were lied about. Enemies right in the city of Nauvoo circulated 
some of the worst blasphemous accusations that men could contemplate 
or imagine. Not only that but they began to publish vituperative 
slander. You know that there was one issue of the Expositor which 
so insulted the women and cast reflections on the men that the City 
Council convened and declared that printing press a nuisance. Later 
Joseph Smith the Prophet, in speaking to Governor Ford, said : "There 
is not a state in the Union that would have stood it as calmly as we, 
that would have put up with it one hour." 

But the Prophet controlled himself and so did his associates, and 
only legal action was taken. He gave himself up under the protection 
of Governor Ford, assured by the honor of the State of Illinois that 
he would be protected and given a proper hearing and a fair trial. 
After he received what seemed to be a partial fulfilment of this promise 
he was released; then a false charge of treason was placed against 
him, and illegally and without shadow of right he and his brother were 
incarcerated in jail. Then lies continued to circulate. We know what 
the result was. The best blood of this country was shed in innocence. 
He knew he was innocent. He knew his rights. So did his brother 
Hyrum, John Taylor and Willard Richards who were there with him. 



ELDER DAVID O. McKAY 



13 



But because of lies, black and damnable, the Prophet Joseph and his 
brother Hyrum were martyred. 

Governor Ford himself tells about the falsehoods that were cir- 
culated after the martyrdom, and how the people's minds were stirred 
up against them. In the midst of it all what was the Prophet's attitude? 
A calm, Christ-like attitude. Said he, when he was going to Carthage 
that evening: 

"I am going like a lamb to the slaughter, but I am calm as a summer's 
morning. I have a conscience void of offense toward God and all men. If 
they take my life I shall die an innocent man, and it will yet be said of: me, 
he was murdered in cold blood." 

THE MAN OF GALILEE 

What was Jesus' attitude when they circulated calumny against 
him? Wherever he went he was pursued by men who were his enemies. 
They watched him in order that they might trip him. They questioned 
him in order that they might get him into a trap. 

"How difficult it is |to speak if one is speaking in the presence of people 
who are watching each sentence, determined if possible to catch the speaker 
in error. Wherever Jesus went his conduct was scrutinized by eyes that were_ 
green with envy. Everything he did was criticized, every action called forth 
a storm of abuse. His enemies gathered around him like a swarm of mosquitoes 
biting him, like a swarm of hornets stinging him — but he never complained. They 
nagged at him, pelted him with abusive epithets, sowed the land with lies about 
him, but he never grew bitter. We have known many a good man to grow 
sour simply because he had been misunderstood by a few people. Many a 
woman has grown bitter because of unfortunate experiences with those who 
were her fellow-workers in the Church. This Man of Galilee knew little but 
misunderstanding and ingratitude and criticism and abuse ; but he never com- 
plained, and at the end of the day he was as sweet as at dawn. Long before 
he came somebody had said that when the supreme man arrived he would submit 
to tribulation without complaining. As men looked upon this Man of Galilee 
they were reminded of the great line of the prophet, 'As a lamb before the 
shearer is dumb, so he opened not his mouth.' " 

Brethren and sisters, what is the attitude, the spirit of the vilifier, 
as compared with the spirit of the Christ, the spirit of the leaders of 
the Church, the spirit of every true Latter-day Saint? It is better to 
suffer wrong than to do wrong, and if we as Latter-day Saints will but 
hold to the truth as it has been revealed all will eventually be well. 
My brethren and sisters, let me bear you my testimony that in the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ as it has been revealed in this day lies the hope 
and the salvation of the human family. I feel it with all my soul. 
I believe I can prove it to the satisfaction of any who will honestly and 
prayerfully investigate the tenets and organization of the Church. 

THE TRIUMPH OF TRUTH 

Then let us rally around our President who this morning said, 
"Hold to the truth, be true to the principles of life and salvation as 
revealed in this dispensation." 

It has been impressively said that : 



14 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



"A man cannot believe in God without believing in the final inevitable 
triumph of truth. If you have truth on your side you can pass through the 
dark valley of slander, misrepresentation and abuse, undaunted, as though 
you wore a suit of mail that no bullet could enter, no arrow could pierce. You 
can hold your head high, toss it fearlessly and defiantly, look every man calmly 
and unflinchingly in the eye, as though you rode, a victorious king, returning at 
the head of your legions with banners waving and lances glistening, and bugles 
filling the air with music. You can feel the great expansive wave of moral 
health surging through you as the quickened blood courses through the body 
of him who is gladly, gloriously proud of physical health. You will know 
that all will come right in the end, that it must come, that error must flee before 
the great white light of truth, as darkness slinks away into nothingness in the 
presence of the sunburst. Then, with truth as your guide, your companion, your 
ally, and inspiration, you tingle with the consciousness of your kinship with 
the Infinite and all the petty trials, sorrows and sufferings of life fade away like 
temporary, harmless visions seen in a dream." 

God help us to be anchored in the truth, give us power to preach 
it, and power to live it. Then, when slander, calumny and misrepresenta- 
tion are hurled against us, they will fall as weakened arrows against an 
impenetrable coat of mail. 

May we ever carry forward this great work in the spirit of the 
Master, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

I feel assured this morning that we are to have a. most excellent 
conference because the Spirit of the Lord has been with us and has 
dictated the words that have been spoken. I trust that for the few 
moments I stand here I too may be led to say that which will be pleasing 
in the sight of our Heavenly Father and beneficial to you. 

TESTIMONY CONCERNING GREAT TRUTHS 

I am grateful for a testimony of the Gospel, for a knowledge that 
Jesus Christ is the Redeemer of the world, the Only Begotten Son 
of the living God. I know that he came into the world as its Redeemer 
and as the Savior of men. He brought salvation and exaltation to all 
who are willing to accept in faithfulness all of his teachings. Moreover, 
I know that Joseph Smith was called of God and was a prophet, and 
that he was given divine authority and spoke the truth. To him were 
the heavens opened. He received a visitation of the Father and the 
Son and was called to usher in the great last dispensation known as the 
Dispensation of the Fulness of Times. This dispensation was spoken 
of by ancient prophets and by the apostles of former times. The 
ancient prophets looked forward to this dispensation for they knew 
it was to be the time of the restoration of all things both which are in 
heaven and which are on earth. This restoration was to come through 
the sending of the Gospel from heaven with the fulness of the priest- 
hood, and all things were eventually to be set in order according to the 
will of the Lord. 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 



15 



I am grateful for the Gospel as it has come to us in its simplicity, 
and in its fulness, with all its power and authority, for the holy priest- 
hood cannot be separated from the Gospel which is the power of 
God unto salvation. This power has again been brought to men and 
they have the privilege of worshipping God in spirit and in truth. 
How grateful I am for this knowledge, and to know that I have been 
reared in it. All my life it has been my desire to know the truth and 
to have a testimony which comes from the Spirit of the Lord, and I can 
say that I know that these things are true. 

THAT WE MAY NOT BE DECEIVED 

Our attention has been called this morning to the fact that there 
are many spirits abroad in the world, that we are to try the spirits. As 
I understand this it means that we should prove them to know from 
what source they come. How are we going to prove the spirits and 
understand which are right and which are wrong unless we ourselves 
are walking in the light? Unless we have been studying and ponder- 
ing over the principles of the Gospel we may be deceived. If we have 
not had in our hearts the spirit of prayer, of ,faith, of humility, and 
have been obedient to our Eternal Father, then how are we going 
to distinguish between these spirits and discover what comes from 
God and what comes from man or from some evil source? 

The Lord has marked out the way. He has given us a key to the 
situation. It was never the intention of our Father in heaven to leave 
men to grope and feel their way in darkness and that without any 
light to guide them, and expect them under such conditions to find 
their way back into his kingdom and into his holy presence. That 
is not the way of the Lord. All down the ages from the beginning our 
Father in heaven has shown his kindness for his children and has been 
willing to give them direction. From the earliest times the heavens 
have been opened, the Lord has sent messengers from his presence 
to divinely appointed servants, men holding the authority of the priest- 
hood who have -been commissioned to teach the principles of the 
Gospel, to warn the people and teach them righteousness ; and these 
men have received this knowledge, this inspiration and guidance from 
these messengers from the presence of God. This is true of our 
own dispensation. There is no need for men to shut their eyes and feel 
that there is no light only as they may depend upon their reason, for 
the Lord has always been willing to lead and direct and show the way. 
He has sent, as I say, messengers from his presence. He has sent 
revelation. He has commanded that his word be written, that it be 
published, so that all the people might know it. 

UNTO ALL MEN 

In the very first section of the Doctrine and Covenants there are 
some very significant things in relation to this matter as the Lord has 
given it both to the Church and to the world. This revelation, known 



16 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



as the preface to the Doctrine and Covenants, is the preface by the 
Son of God himself to this great body of revelation and command- 
ment which has been given to the Church and to the world if they will 
receive it for their salvation. And it begins as follows: 

"Hearken, O ye people of my church, .saith the voice of him who dwells on 
high, and whose eyes are upon all men; yea, verily I say: Hearken ye people 
from afar; and ye that are upon the islands of the sea, listen together." 

So you see .in this introduction to this preface the Lord calls the 
members of the Church, the people of the islands of the sea, in foreign 
lands, in all parts of the earth, to listen, to give heed to the words which 
he shall speak, that they might receive his truth and come out of dark- 
ness. And then he says : 

"For verily the voice of the Lord is unto all men, and there is none to 
escape; and there is no eye that shall not see, neither ear that shall not hear, 
neither heart that shall not be penetrated." 

HERE OR HEREAFTER 

We may wonder how that will come to pass because we under- 
stand that with the best efforts we can make in sending forth and 
publishing this word there are many who do not hear it. Our two 
thousand missionaries who are scattered over the face of the earth 
preaching the Gospel are very few in comparison ,with the millions 
unto whom this Gospel is to be proclaimed. But the Lord will reach 
the hearts of the people, his word will not fail. And I do not under- 
stand even from this wording that it is necessary that every heart be 
penetrated and every ear hear in this life. But if they have not heard, 
if this opportunity has not come to them through the preaching of 
the Elders and through the things that have been published in the word 
of the Lord that has gone forth by revelation, the opportunity is 
going to come to them and they must, hear it in the spirit world. 

And so the Lord in his kindness and mercy intends to bring these 
truths of this restored Gospel to every soul living or dead. In this 
manner every heart shall be penetrated and every ear shall hear. 

"And the rebellious shall be pierced with much sorrow ; ^f or their iniquities 
shall be spoken upon the housetops, and their secret acts shall be revealed. 

"And the voice of warning shall be unto all people, by the mouths of my 
disciples, whom I have chosen in these last days." 

THE LORD'S PURPOSE 

And then farther on in this revelation the Lord declares : 

"Wherefore, I the Lord, knowing the calamity which should come upon, 
the inhabitants of the earth, called upon my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and 
spake unto him from heaven, and gave him commandments; 

"And also gave commandments to others, that they should proclaim these 
things unto the world; and all this that it might be fulfilled which was written 
by "the prophets — 

"The weak things of the world shall come forth and break down the mighty 
and strong ones, that man should not counsel his fellow man, neither trust in the 
arm of flesh — 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 



17 



"But that every man might speak in the name of God the Lord, even the 
Savior of the world; 

"That faith also might increase in the earth ; - 
"That mine everlasting covenant might be established ; 

"That the fulness of my gospel might be proclaimed by the weak and the 
simple unto the ends of the world, and before kings and rulers. 

"Behold, I am God and have spoken it; these commandments are of me, 
and were given unto my servants in their weakness, after the manner of their 
language, that they might come to understanding." 

SEARCH THESE THINGS 

I have read from this revelation with the idea of impressing' upon 
our minds the commandment that comes from our Father in heaven 
through his Son Jesus Christ who is the author of these words, that 
it is the duty not only of the eldership of this Church but of all the 
members of this Church to search, these revelations and commandments, 
that we might know them. The Elder of this Church no matter who 
he is who is unfamiliar with the word of the Lord as it has come 
unto us through the proclamation of his Son and through his servants 
in these latter days, is not magnifying his calling in this Church. 
Moreover, it is the duty of the members of this Church to make them- 
selves familiar with the revelations as they have been given, and with 
the commandments as they have been taught in these revelations, or 
have been presented in them and given to the people, that we might know 
the truth which makes us free. And if we will study them, if we will 
put them into practice, if we will keep the commandments of the Lord, 
we will know the truth and there shall be no weapon formed against 
us that shall prosper. There shall be no false doctrines, no teaching 
of men that will deceive us. There are many cults and many false 
faiths, there are' many strange ideas in the world, but if we will search 
these revelations then we will be fortified against errors and we will 
be made strong. False teachings will have no effect upon us for we 
will know that truth which makes us free. 

The word of the Lord which he spoke when in his ministry is just 
as true today as it was then to this effect, that he who will do the will 
of the Father shall know of the doctrine, and he will not be led astray; 
he will not be enticed or overcome by falsehoods and these teachings 
that prevail in the world which tend to destroy faith in God and his 
revelations. 

"whoso treasureth up my word" 

Let me read to you this key that the Lord gave to his disciples 
when he was in his ministry. Speaking of the last days, the days just 
preceding his coming he said : 

"And whoso treasureth up my word shall not be deceived, for the Son of 
Man shall come, and he shall send his angels before him with the great sound 
of a trumpet, and they shall gather together the remainder of his elect from the 
four winds, from one end of heaven to the other." 

Now remember, brethren and sisters, if you treasure up the word 
of the Lord, if you study these revelations, not merely those that are 



18 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



in the Doctrine and Covenants, but those that are in all the standard 
works of the Church, and you put into practice the commandments 
that are here found, you will not be deceived in these perilous times, 
but you shall have the spirit of discernment and you shall know the 
truth and shall know falsehood, for you shall have power to know 
the spirits of men and to understand the Spirit of the Lord. 

May we do this I pray, walking in righteousness, in the name 
of the Lord Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

It is my purpose to make a few remarks on temperance and upon 
upholding the Prohibition laws. 

WHAT SAYS THE LAW? 

In Utah it is unlawful to import, advertise, give away, exchange, 
dispense, or serve liquor in any form. In fact, he who has liquor in 
his hand, in his home, or otherwise in] his possession, violates the Utah 
statute. The Federal Constitution prohibits the manufacture, the sale, 
or the transportation of intoxicating liquors. 

WHAT SAYS LINCOLN? 

Abraham Lincoln has been called our greatest American. He says : 
"Bad laws, if they exist, should be repealed as soon as possible ; still, 
while they continue in force, they should be religiously observed." 

In this day of lawlessness and disrespect for law, my purpose is 
to appeal to the members of my own Church, as well as to all other 
good citizens, to support the laws of our state and the Constitution 
of our country. By disregarding or breaking the Prohibition statutes, 
we may bring all Jaw into disrespect. 

By taking one glass of beer, leading and influential citizens, those 
who direct business and are owners of property, are encouraging 
disrespect for aU law. Just as touching the little electric exciter brings 
into operation the mammoth dynamo so he who drinks a single glass 
of liquor ought to realize that he is helping to break down those funda- 
mental barriers which the law provides for protecting him in his rights 
to his own property. 

WHAT SAYS SCIENCE? 

In this age of science and scientific investigation, it has been 
demonstrated beyond question that alcoholic liquor is harmful. It 
has been proved that alcohol is not, as was formely believed, merely 
a stimulant ; it is a poison, it is a dangerous habit-forming drug. 
Always it produces stupor. It has been shown that alcohol has much 
the same effect^on the human body and mmd that ether or chloroform 
haSr i 1 : ; 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 



19 



The great mass of people today accept the teachings of science — 
that alcohol, even when taken in small amounts, is harmful. Says 
Professor Sims Wogdhead of Cambridge : "A man under the influence 
of a small quantity of alcohol (not drunk I remind you) has no right 
to believe his own senses. He cannot trust them to give him facts, 
and he cannot Tely upon his judgment for the interpretation of the 
facts." 

Experiments show that when men have taken alcohol they actually 
feel able to do more, and think they are doing more ; but measurements 
demonstrate that the work they actually accomplish is considerably 
less and is inferior. Alcohol deceives. It deadens the power of 
judgment ; he who uses it is no longer capable of drawing correct con- 
clusions. 

WHAT SAY WE? 

Liquor may make tongues wag more freely, but the thoughts 
expressed are less accurate, less worth-while. Who would care to 
carry on a conversation even with his dearest friend if that friend 
were drunk or even tipsy? The use of alcohol is a curse, not only 
to him who indulges, but to his dependents, his kindred, and his 
country. To enforce Prohibition, and thus to banish alcohol as a 
beverage, would produce benefits immeasurable. 

WHAT SAY THE DOCTORS? 

Dr. C. P. Bells of Toledo says that he has in his files more than 
$11,000 in bad accounts of those who drank and did not pay their bills 
before 1918. Since that period his loss from unpaid bills has not 
exceeded $500. 

To users of liquor, Dr. Henry Smith Williams says : "You are 
threatening the physical structure of your stomach, your liver, your 
kidneys, your heart, your blood vessels, your nerves, your brain; you 
are decreasing your capacity for work in any field ; you are lowering 
the grade of your mind, dulling your higher aesthetic sense, and taking 
the finer edge off your morals ; you are distinctly lessening your chances 
of maintaining health ; you may be entailing on your descendants 
incalculable misery." \ 

And the famous surgeon Sir Frederick Greves remarks that "the 
best physical condition is impossible if any alcohol is used" — that "no 
man is at his best who works on even a moderate amount of liquor." 

WHAT SAYS THE CHURCH ? 

At the time, a hundred years ago, when Joseph Smith proclaimed 
to the Church and the world that strong drinks are not good for man, 
the daily rations of soldiers included a certain quantity of rum or 
whiskey. Stimulants were supposed to be necessary to fortify the 
soldier against fatigue and hardship, to aid him on his tedious marches, 
and especially to give him courage in battle. In our day, science has 
demonstrated that alcohol does none of these things, that its effects are 



20 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



the very opposite. Alcohol no longer is served to soldiers, and every 
effort is made to prevent them from using it. 

WHAT SAY THE PAPERS? 

The successful enforcement of Prohibition will reduce the amount 
of drunken driving. Look at any issue of the Deseret News, the 
Tribune, the Telegram ; observe how much space is devoted to drunken 
driving, to the accidents resulting from it, and to court proceedings 
arising out of it. i 

A recent editorial in the Salt Lake Telegram criticizes drunken 
drivers and also those public officials who permit these offenders to 
settle their cases out of court. It scores those "who cast their deadly 
menace across traffic, thus threatening lives and property, but who, 
through a streak of good luck, escape a crash." 

In an editorial dated September 27, the Tribune says Utah is 
bound to recognize the serious problem of drunken driving and fruitless 
prosecutions. The public, the police, the prosecutors, and the courts 
have been held intermittently to blame. 

"The public contributes witnesses who refuse to testify, * * * provides the 
friendly influence which seeks to tamper with officials charged with enforcement ; 
places selfish interests 'above public welfare; and contributes the juror who 
does not take seriously his responsibility." 

WHAT ACCOUNTS FOR SUCCESS? 

We live in an age of keen competition. There may be but little 
difference between the work of individuals, yet one succeeds while 
another fails. He wins who works a little faster, a little more accurately, 
a little more efficiently. Intoxicants, even in small quantities, produce 
that little difference which changes work — changes a life — from success 
to failure. This poison, alcohol, if used in only small quantities, 
decreases efficiency. 

DO PUBLIC OFFICIALS BREAK TFIE LAW ? 

Do public officials or other leading citizens violate the law in your 
presence ? 

Some maintain that there is no moral turpitude in breaking a 
traffic law, for example ; but that stealing horses or robbing banks is a 
very different and much more serious offense. 

Those who steal cattle or rob banks are taking only that which 
can be measured with money. But when prominent and influential 
citizens, by their example, lead young folks into a temptation that has 
wrecked so many human lives, they are taking from young men and 
women, from their fathers and mothers, and from the Republic, some- 
thing that dollars cannot measure, that money cannot replace. 

WILL LEADERS LEAD? 

Social and business leaders, being strong characters, are able to 
resist temptation ; to them I make special appeal. The success of our 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 



21 



youth demands that leading citizens live the law and set examples they 
desire to have young folks follow. Will they not aid the youth to 
acquire those sterling qualities which mean success — honesty, honor, 
dependability, and sobriety? For these the world is always looking, 
and for these the world stands always ready to pay. 

WHAT CAN EXAMPLE DO? 

In the days of the saloon it was continuously demonstrated that 
many have not the ability to resist its temptations. So by the example 
of those who are older, the younger generation is led into a temptation 
that may mean ruin; to their parents it will mean disgrace. To the 
nation, if the _great mass of the youth become drinkers, it will mean 
decay. 

Imagine the condition where a law-breaker has an associate law- 
breaker for an arresting officer, another such associate as a prosecuting 
attorney, and a third on the bench as the presiding judge. What must 
be the Verdict when the law-breaker is looking into the faces of 
members of the jury who are equally guilty of breaking the law? 
Heaven preserve us from such a situation. Under such conditions the 
life of any nation would be short. Ruin would be certain ; the end of 
the country would be near. 

Nor does it take a great stretch of the imagination to see such 
conditions actually existing in our own country. 

"At Milton, N. H., one night last week, ("Time", September 28, 1931) an 
automobile careened down the street and smashed into a telephone pole. Police 
approached the darkened car, peered in at a bald man, pronounced him drunk, 
took him to the station house. When they got him under a light and saw who 
he was they immediately released him, preferred no charges. He was Judge 
Eri C. Oakes, 42, of the State Superior Court. 

"Ironically, one of the first cases on his docket the next morning was the 
trial of a drunken driver. A jury found the man guilty ; Judge Oakes sentenced 
him to jail for 90 idays, but did not impose fine or costs, suspended sentence 
until the man could harvest his crops. * * * The following day he presided 
at the trial of a hit-and-run driver. As the trial got under way, a court 
attendant tiptoed up, whispered to Judge Oakes that an assistant attorney-general 
of the state wanted to See him. 

"With a tragic, white face Judge Oakes returned from his conference. 
'I am obliged to call this a mistrial,' he said. Court attendants flocked around 
him sympathetically, watched him walk slowly out of the courtroom. When he 
got home he sent his motherless 14-year-old daughter away, climbed into bed, 
* * * and shot himself through the head." 

For our present, serious wide-spread disrespect for law, many 
of our well-to-do social and 'business leaders are in part to blame. To 
their patriotism I appeal, and urge that they obey the law and support 
the Constitution. If bootleggers were patronized only by the vicious 
and the wicked, their profits and business would soon disappear. 

WHAT IS OUR ANSWER? 

If you are undecided about whether or not to obey the law, or 



22 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



uncertain as to whether or not it will be wise to participate in no 
functions where the Prohibition law is broken, ask yourselves (Oral 
Hygiene, July, 1931): 

1. Does it improve young men and women morally, socially, 
or financially, to be drinkers of liquor? I 

2. Can you name well-known manufacturers who hire men who 
drink in preference to those who do not? 

3. Can affidavits be produced from citizens who drink to prove 
it beneficial to their health and occupation? 

4. Can evidence be produced from bankers that their deposits 
fell off when the sale of liquor was discontinued? 

5. Will manufacturers testify that it is an advantage to have 
saloons near their plants? 

6. Do charitable organizations have more families among non- 
drinkers that require assistance than among those who drink? 

7. Do statistics show that a man who drinks is a better citizen 
than one who does not? 

8. Can letters be produced from wives or mothers who pray for 
saloons or government depositories, that their husbands and sons may 
have places in which to spend their time and money? 

9. Do we desire railroad engineers, chauffeurs, and those who 
drive air-planes to drink? ! 

In civilized and modern America we must preserve the young 
people of our nation from drunkenness. Even in Russia "tremendous 
educational efforts are being made to eliminate drinking from the life 
of the peasant and worker. Everywhere, in every station, hotel, and 
factory, one sees posters depicting some phase of the drink evil. Most 
of the younger generation won't touch alcohol in any form, and I 
have seen the Young Pioneers (the Communist Boy Scouts of Russia) 
many times attempting to restrain grown-ups from overindulgence." 
(The Nation, June 3 and 17, 1931.) 

WHY NOT DECIDE WISELY? 

I appeal to you as citizens of our nation, to decide whether you 
are ready to follow the dignified and glorious example of our Pilgrim 
fathers, who went to Church carrying their Bibles ; or whether you 
will follow the leadership of the few of our American Legion who 
recently rode through the streets of Detroit swinging their bottles and 
shouting for beer. 

I am not speaking of the great patriotic body of the Legion or 
of its high-minded, law-abiding leaders. I refer only to the drunken 
few. For the American Legion I have the highest regard. For the 
men who stood ready and willing to give their lives for the liberty 
of the world, I have real reverence. But in these days, when the great- 
est problem before America is lawlessness, I cannot countenance the 
breaking of the law by even a few members of the American Legion, 
or a few of any other organization. 

I have before made a solemn pledge, and in conclusion I make

it here. Fellow churchmen, fellow countrymen — all who are living 
in the land of Lincoln, to you I appeal to save our country from 
destruction because of lawlessness and disrespect for law. This is 
the covenant I have made : iGod helping me, I promise not to participate 
in any function, social or otherwise, where the law is broken ; and 
that I will not cast my vote for any candidate on any ticket unless 

1 have reasonable assurance that the man himself lives in accordance 
with the law. 

The hymn, "O ye mountains high," was sung by the congregation. 
Elder Peter J. Ricks, President of the Fremont Stake, offered 
the closing prayer. 

The Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock p. m. 

FIRST DAY 

AFTERNOON MEETING 

The second session of the Conference commenced promptly at 

2 o'clock p. m. 

President Heber J. Grant presided and announced that the congre- 
gation would sing the hymn, "Now let us rejoice in the day of Salva- 
tion." 

After the singing of this hymn, Elder Hyrum B. Calder, President 
of the Uintah Stake, offered the invocation. 

The congregation sang "How firm a foundation, ye Saints of the 
Lord." 

ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 

First Counselor in the "Presiding Bishopric 

I am happy, my brethren and sisters, to be with you here this 
morning and to listen to the remarks that have (been made. As a 
member of the Presiding Bishopric much of my time during the last 
year has been taken by those who find themselves distressed. In an 
effort to discover the reason for such distress I find that a large 
majority have brought that condition upon themselves through their 
own actions. May I give you an example? 

One laboring man seeking employment was put to work at a 
nominal salary and he understood that he was to be employed only a 
few days and then would be replaced by someone else. After a week 
he received his check. He stated that he had purchased a radio, had 
paid five dollars down and agreed to pay a dollar a week, and would 
lose his radio unless he continued in employment. 

An aged brother, past the fruitful age of life, who some years 
ago owned clear a very choice farm, had sufficient means to spend his 
winters in California. He now finds himself without a farm, too old 
to.find employment, wondering what he is going to do. It seems that 



24 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



he was not satisfied with the land he had and felt that he should have 
more. To secure more it was necessary to mortgage that which he- 
had. Prices did inot continue as they were. His land did not produce 
crops as it had been producing and he soon found that he could not 
keep up his payments on principal and interest and taxes. He thus 
lost his inheritance to those who held the mortgage. 

On the other hand, one of our ibishops called at the office to ask 
advice. He had money in the bank and desired to know where he 
could put that money to make it safe. I inquired how this money 
had come to him ? His answer was : 

"When I came from the old country I heard your father deliver a sermon 
in the tabernacle in which he told the people to keep out of debt, to get a 
little piece of land, just enough upon which to make a, home, and then save. 
When enough money is accumulated to buy more, buy it, but do not go into 
debt. Live within your means. Do without some things you would like, with 
the hope that in time you will enjoy those things without being in bondage 
during the time of enjoyment. I remembered that and secured a small piece 
of ground, a neighbor loaned me his team and plow to do the first plowing. 

"I had a little means with which to build a modest little one-room house, 
and since that time I have added to my holdings." He said : "I have always 
produced enough on my farm to pay my tithing and my taxes and then have 
sufficient left to keep myself and my family in comfort, and I have never been 
in debt." 

A few weeks ago while attending a conference I was taken to 
the home of a bishop, a modest, comfortable little home. There were 
eight children in the family. He had a small farm of about thirty 
acres. i 

I asked about conditions in his ward. He answered : 

"We are not suffering, at least those of us who have not contracted 
debts. Some are suffering; those who have gone into debt for things they could 
do without are finding this to be a real hard time. I will not suffer. The Lord 
has been good to me. I have harvested my wheat crop — turned it into the mill 
and taken flour — I have enough flour put away to last me during the coming year. 
My potato crop is promising, and my other vegetables also. We will have sufficient 
food to carry us through the winter and I have enough money to pay my taxes 
and to fill my bin with coal sufficient to keep us warm." 

I have given you two sides of a great story which is at the present 
time a problem world-wide — what are we to do during these times 
of depression? A year after the close of the (World War I attended 
a convention in the East. One of the speakers in that convention 
among other sayings made the following statement : 

"Our experience with the army has taught us that today the people have 
no love for the old conventional religion. Instead, there are selfishness and 
pettiness. We must do away with the false social distinction and create a new 
church ideal for our present needs, one with social aims worth fighting for, not 
a mere selfish gospel of safety. Let them lift up the better faith of the 
Christian life. Let them practice as well as preach fraternity and draw together 
in one common cause." 

We may well recall that from the very beginning of the world 



ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 



25 



the Lord has used two methods of calling forcibly to the attention 
of his children the fact that they owe qbedience to him and his laws. 
One is that of war, destruction by the sword ; the other is that of famine 
through which he brings us face to face with his power. It seems 
that under the conditions of poverty we are more apt to turn to God 
than we are when facing the cannon or the sword. The last war 
developed the fact that men were turning from God. Mammon was 
made their God. They seemed to console themselves in the thought 
that man is not acutally created in the image of God, that he is a 
spirit, a IGod of love, who dwells in the heart of man, which it seems 
to me makes of man an infidel, for under such conditions one can create 
his own God and worship in his own manner. At the present time we 
find ourselves in a condition that has followed such periods from the 
very beginning, and the Lord has found it necessary to remind us, as 
he has others in ages 'past, that he will not be mocked and that it is our 
duty to turn again to him, to meet our obligations to him, and serve 
him in faith. To do this is not only a duty but a privilege with a 
promise of blessings. 

President Grant has again urged us to pay our tithing and fast 
offerings. How many of us are paying an honest tithe and fast offer- 
ing? I shall not mention at this time the average amount paid, but 
suggest that when we go home we look over our tithing and fast offering 
record, study it carefully, and I think many will find that although 
they feel they are doing a wonderful work they are only paying a 
mere pittance. Many of us feel that we are faithfully serving the Lord, 
and many are. The ( Lord has said that we have many things to do and 
many things to repent of, and that we are not pardoned because we 
seek to counsel in our own way. 

As I travel through this Church I find many men of integrity and 
faith who are willing to give up all in the world they have in an effort to 
serve God. I am not belittling in the least their work, but there are 
many of us who should be following, who are leaving them to carry 
the load. We are not measuring up, and because of those who fail 
to keep the commandments of God many who are striving to serve 
him are required to pay the penalty with them. 

My brethren and sisters, let us think of these things seriously 
and in the spirit of faith and humbly. Time will not permit me to go 
into more detail. Let us study our own conditions and our own affairs, 
not forgetting our neighbors, plead with the Lord that he will help 
us overcome these conditions which are so distressing at this time. 
He has shown the way and given his promise. Have we faith in him ? 
Have we faith in his servants whom we sustain as our leaders ? If so, 
we shall not be long in finding the way out. 

May his blessings be upon us. May we have wisdom antl judg- 
ment and love to guide us in all that we do, I pray in the name of 
Jesus Christ, Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ELDER HYRUM G. SMITH 

Presiding Patriarch of the Church 

I am very grateful to be present on /this occasion, and trust that 
I may enjoy the Spirit of the Lord while I stand before you this 
afternoon. I enjoyed this morning's session very much, and testify 
that the Spirit of the Lord was present in goodly portion. 1 

I desire to express my appreciation and gratitude for the prayers 
of the Saints, in my behalf, and I acknowledge the hand of the Lord 
in his blessings, that I am able to |be present upon this occasion. 

PEOPLE DISTURBED OVER FINANCIAL CONDITIONS 

A great many of the Latter-day Saints have been somewhat 
disturbed in their feelings as to how they are going to take care of 
themselves financially, or how they are going to support their families. 
Among the chief visitors at my office seeking comfort are those having 
had employment and lost it. I have learned of their sympathy and their 
faith, which are pure and sacred, and their testimonies are of great 
value to them. 

I am grateful for the support that has come to me through answer 
to prayer, for I know that the Lord has blessed Us, both as a people 
and as individuals. > i 

FAITH IN THE CHURCH AND ITS LEADERS 

I am not discouraged or downhearted. ;My faith has not wavered. 
I still have faith in the work, and know that it is true. I have faith 
in the leaders of the Church, and know that they are worthy servants, 
that they are humble and devoted to the work of the Lord, some of 
them going beyond their natural strength in order to perform their 
wonderful tasks or to fulfil their appointments. Our missionaries, too, 
have been wonderfully blessed and preserved They have been attended 
by the Spirit and power of the Lord. They have made many friends, 
and their teachings have brought conviction to many honest-hearted 
souls. 

VISITORS FROM MANY STATES [AND COUNTRIES 

During the summer months a great many tourists, both members 
and non-members, have visited my office, people who have come from 
the States, and in many cases those who have come from the countries 
of the world and from the islands of the sea. Automobiles and good 
roads make these conditions possible. These friendly visits from 
the people both far and near are doing much to spread and establish 
the truth. / 

Many who come to my office are filled with some degree of 
anxiety »over their conditions and their circumstances, and as a rule 
when people are out of work and do not know from where their needs 
are to be supplied, they are very humble, so that I have been instru- 
mental, in a way, in trying to cheer and comfort those who are 



ELDER HYRUM G. SMITH 



27 



tried their feelings and in their conditions and circumstances. 

I bear testimony that the Lord has been very gracious to the mem- 
bers of the Church and that he has further promises and blessings 
in store for them. 

DISCERNING BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL SPIRITS 

I should like also to add my testimony to the testimonies of my 
brethren who spoke this morning, concerning the spirits that are 
with us to guide, inspire, and protect us. Many people have said to 
me : "Brother Smith, how can you tell the difference between the 
promptings of the Lord, or his agencies, and the promptings of the 
adversary or his agencies ?" They say they are unable, in most respects, 
to discern the difference between those promptings. I have said : 
"After earnest and sincere prayer follow your first impression, and 
you will always go right." Then they say: "Well, how can I tell 
which is my first impression? They are usually so close to each other 
it is difficult to even tell which is the first impression." Then I say : 
"The impression made by the Spirit that is for our guide in safety in 
the Church is always from a good spirit, the Spirit that proclaims and 
announces the truth, and the truth doesn't need an alibi or crutches 
to support it." So if you go back and knock down all the crutches, 
all the alibis, all the excuses, the ifs and ands and buts that attempt 
to support it, that crowd and urge us — because, as a rule, I have 
discovered that the adversary's agencies, in their promptings, are usually 
of an urging, crowding, hurrying nature, while the Spirit of the Lord 
and his agencies are always of a quiet, sweet, peaceful and convincing 
character, — so that after we have done away with all the excuses, 
all the alibis that usually support our experiences, we can discover 
which is the right spirit. The spirit of conviction, of peace and of 
charity, which is the love of the Lord and his work, is not in a hurry, 
but has time to decide, time to weigh, time to consider; does not act 
in haste, but in calm deliberation. ,We learn then the truth, and we 
have a guide which is a companion to every member of the Church 
who is faithful and true, so that we are able, through the blessings 
of the Lord, to receive that comfort and consolation which will support 
us, even in time of distress. 

I bear my testimony, my brethren and sisters, that the Lord does 
give lis this guide and this support, if we (are faithful and true to him. 

BLESSINGS THROUGH DEVOTION 

I desire to extend to the Latter-day Saints in all the Church 
the blessings of the Lord, and as .his humble servant I pray that 
peace and comfort and consolation from the Lord may come to every 
member of the Church. I am sure in my feelings that the Lord will 
continue to bless and support us, but I think he is also giving us a 
splendid lesson for service, while he is giving a greater lesson to the 
world, who know him not. He is giving us a splendid opportunity to 
show our faith and our works. None of us has suffered in want. We 



28 



GENERAL CONEERENCE 



have been supplied, comforted, and sustained. We have had many 
blessings of the land and of the things that are produced upon it. Our 
comfortable and happy homes and our conditions in life all proclaim 
the graciousness of the Lord to his people. W,e can retain these bless- 
ings through our devotion to the Lord. 

I pray that the Lord will continue to remember us, and especially 
those who have made sacred covenants in sacred places, and those 
who have been magnified with the power of the priesthood, which 
is a great honor to bear. It always brings a distressful feeling to me 
to see members of the Church careless and indifferent and slight 
their covenants and their privileges. I pray that the Lord will help 
us, that we may not slight our privileges, that we may be true to our 
covenants and hold them sacred always. I pray the Lord to bless 
our young people when they start out in life, that they may have 
strength and faith sufficient to retain their companionship and asso- 
ciation, and be true and faithful to their responsibilities in the Church. 

I desire to bless you all, and I pray the favors of the Lord upon 
you, upon the officers and members of the Church, the missionaries, 
and all who are laboring for the truth ; and I declare these testimonies 
and pray God's blessings upon you all in the name of Jesus Christ, 
Amen.

ELDER SAMUEL O. BENNION 

President of the Central States Mission 

I feel very happy, my brethren and sisters, to be in attendance at 
this conference and I appreciate the opportunity of meeting and visiting 
with the Saints of God at this time. 

Yesterday, when President Grant was speaking, the thought came 
to my mind, What does it profit a person to pray to our Heavenly 
Father for guidance and for spiritual strength and wisdom if at the 
same time that person does not reverence God's authority here in the 
earth? It seems to me that men could not help but recognize that it 
would be futile to ask God for favors and at the same time disregard 
the council of the Authority of the Lord Jesus Christ here in the 
earth. The Authorities of this Church are our Eternal Father's repre- 
sentatives here in the earth and if men will not abide by their instruc- 
tions, how can they expect to receive instruction from God, our Father ; 
and, yet, we do find some people who will not recognize the council of 
the Lord's Authority here in the earth, but, they feel that they can go 
over the heads of the Authority of God and get what they want direct 
from the Father. 

I have never found in my life where the Lord ever allowed an 
angel even to overstep God's Authority in the earth. He did not do it 
himself while he sojourned in the earth and he most certainly has not 
changed for he is the same yesterday, today and forever. He changes 
not, neither does he change his principles for they are eternal truths. 



ELDER SAMUEL O. BENNION 



29 



These principles have ibeen revealed to us anew in this day for our 
guidance and for our salvation. 

I bring you good tidings from your sons and daughters who are 
laboring in the mission field of the Central States. A fine lot of young 
men and women, and they are laboring earnestly, and zealously and in 
a creditable way for the building up of the (Church and Kingdom 
of God in the earth. There seems never to have been a time when 
there was a better opportunity to do missionary work than at the present 
time. People are paying more attention to the calls made^by missionaries 
and they are received ibetter. People have more time, and I have con- 
cluded it is partly because of the unemployment, a situation that 
exists almost everywhere at the present time. When people are busy 
and when their time is employed in the making of a living, and in the 
acquiring of money they do not have time to listen to the Gospel plan 
for their soul's salvation, but now, while many of them are not em- 
ployed they do have time and they are more open to conviction and give 
better entertainment than they usually do. As a result, more converts 
are obtained than we ordinarily average in our mission. Environment 
has much to do with the progress of men generally, and where men 
are surrounded by Jbusiness activities they are, of course, influenced by 
that activity, but when they are not surrounded - by business engage- 
ments and have time to devote, then they are more inclined to listen, 
and especially is this true when times of depression exist such as we 
are now witnessing. 

It is the natural intent of most men and women to worship God, 
and they are generally found to be associated with different organiza- 
tions or religious sects. Men and women come into this world with 
a desire to reverence God and that desire continues with them unless 
they destroy their possibilities through Jiving wickedly and through 
lack of proper respect for our Father in heaven. 

I sincerely hope and pray that the spirit of this conference may 
continue to abide with us as a people. We have here representative 
men and women from all over the Church who have come here to get 
instructions and advice and counsel. We ought to he a good people. 
We ought to be a better people. ( We ought to grow better, and I 
believe that we are growing better and that we do take advantage, to a 
great extent, of the opportunities these conferences offer us, as we 
are able to listen to the advice and counsel of our leaders, who are 
inspired men of God and men who are appointed to represent the work 
of God in the earth. President Grant, who stands at the head of this 
organization, is the representative of God in the earth, and those who 
are associated with him are also appointed to act under his direction. 
Men who attempt to reach God and ignore his Authority in the earth 
are making a mistake. 

May the Lord continue to enlighten and bless us with his Spirit, 
and may we yield obedience to the impressions of that Spirit, I humbly 
pray.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ELDER MILES L. JONES 

President of the East Central States Mission 

My brethren and sisters, I rejoice exceedingly in the opportunity 
of meeting with you upon this occasion. While I would much rather 
have remained on my seat and listened to others, yet I realize that when 
we are called upon we should respond and give utterance to such words 
as may be dictated to us by the Spirit of the Lord. 

I am happy in the work in which I am engaged, the missionary 
work in the East Central States. It is opening up wonderfully. During 
the past summer the missionaries have gone out into the country 
districts, especially in the county seats, and there on the county court- 
house grounds and on the streets have held meetings and presented 
the Gospel teachings to those people. We have been instrumental in 
making many friends. In fact, it seems that there is scarcely any 
opposition wherever we go, and the foundation is being laid so that in 
time to come a harvest may be reaped by those who may follow after 
the ones who have been there this season. 

It may be well for me to refer to one particular occasion. Many of 
you recall that years ago the Saints living upon what is known as 
Harker's Island, in North Carolina, ibuilt a chapel, which, about the 
time that it was completed, was burned down iby their enemies. A few 
of our Saints have been faithful there up to the present time, and 
occasionally the Elders have visited that locality and encouraged those 
few people. Some time ago, when those who were engaged in delivering 
Book of Mormon lectures and exhibiting pictures in connection there- 
with visited the island, a young Elder, J. Hopkins Smith, followed these 
lectures with a Gospel discourse, taking the entire evening, giving a good 
outline of Mormonism and showing just what we believe. They^ had 
wonderful success in these meetings. Before these brethren arrived 
upon the island one of the, leading ministers there tried by every possible 
means to prevent them from exhibiting these views and giving these 
lectures, but there was sufficient influence brought to bear that they 
were permitted to go ahead with their meetings. After they had com- 
pleted them this divine vilified them through the press, and the Elders 
answered him. The editor was kind enough to say that it was an open 
forum and that they were entitled to the same space as was the reverend 
gentleman. So they answered his accusations. If I recall aright two 
articles were answered. 

Recently I have had this young Elder visit various parts of the 
mission. He has been in the field now 28 months, and he desires to 
remain until after the conference that we are holding at Roanoke in 
October. He is now going from one district to another, and he desired 
very much, in connection with the president of that district, to visit 
this island again. They announced ahead of time that they would 
be there and hold four meetings. At the first meeting there were about 
five hundred people in attendance, and this same reverend gentleman 
attended the services. He brought with him a nice easy chair, seated 



ELDER MILES L. JONES 



31 



himself directly in front of the stand, and was there at every session. 
At the closing session there were more than seven hundred people in 
attendance. After the services had closed this gentleman came up, 
shook hands with the Elders, and said : "God bless you, gentlemen. 
You have the truth." 

That shows the change in sentiment in that locality, and we find 
the same condition, with very few exceptions, in practically every place 
that we go. I have met with a number of the prominent men in the 
city of -Louisville and other places, and have had the privilege of 
conversing upon the principles of the Gospel with them. It is really 
pleasing to me to hear of their expressions, even in public, after our 
conversations. So I can say that the foundation is being laid for a 
wonderful growth in the Church in the states in which I have the 
privilege of laboring at the present time. 

I rejoice in having the privilege of going into the world, even 
again, and assisting in this great latter-day work. I am thankful to 
my Heavenly Father for the blessing that I enjoy in the way of health. 
I have never enjoyed better health in my life than I have had while in 
that locality, and I am happy to say also that Sister Jones is enjoying 
good health and enjoying the work along with me. Your sons and 
your daughters are laboring energetically and earnestly in spreading 
this work. I am glad to meet those who have been released and who 
have returned home. I have met a number today, and without a single 
exception I have heard them say that they would be glad to come back 
into the field again and take up the work just where they left it off. 
That is the proper spirit for them to maintain, and I am happy to find 
them feeling "that way. 

I rejoice in this work. I know as I know that I live that it is the 
work of the Lord, that the Gospel has been restored to the earth in 
this day and age of the world. 

Just a week ago last Monday a prominent minister came into my 
office, and we had a nice conversation which lasted for an hour or 
so. He said : "I can't understand how it is that you people have pros- 
pered and grown in spite of the opposition you have had to contend 
with from the very organization of your church." It didn't take very 
long to explain that, and I went on a little further and told him that 
when the Gospel was upon the earth, Christ said unto Peter : "I will 
give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatsoever thou 
shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven ; and whatsoever thou shalt 
loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven." When 'Peter and his associates 
were killed, that same power was taken from the earth. And when 
the Gospel was restored in these last days who should come but Peter, 
James and John to restore that power. I want to say, as I said to that 
reverend gentleman and bore testimony to him, that Peter, James and 
John have come to the earth and restored the Melchizedek priesthood. 
This minister turned to me and he said : "Do you believe that?" I said : 
"No, I don't believe it; I know, it." When Jesus said: "If any man will 
do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or 



32 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



whether I speak of myself," they were no idle words, and they apply 
today. 

I want to say to you, that a testimony of the Gospel is one of 
the greatest hlessings that one can enjoy today. God bless you, my 
brethren and my sisters. Encourage your sons and your daughters that 
are in the mission field. Encourage others to come out and assist in this 
great latter-day work, and blessings will come to you. I pray that God 
will continue to bless you with every needful blessing, and I ask it in 
the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER JOHN WELLS 

Second Counselor in the Presiding Bishopric 

I am filled with gratitude for the privilege of being here today 
in this conference assembly. This conference has given me encourage- 
ment, and we all need encouragement sometimes. Above all, I am 
filled with thankfulness to my Heavenly Father for the testimony 
which I enjoy and the knowledge of the Gospel that has come to me. 

I desire to testify that I know this work is the work of the Lord, 
it is the plan of salvation, and by living its precepts we can return 
to our Father in heaven. I know that Joseph Smith was a prophet of 
God, who came in this last dispensation for the purpose of establishing 
the Gospel, and this is another reason that my heart is filled with 
thankfulness. 

This morning I desire to refer to an incident in the life of the 
Master which has impressed me very much. On the Tuesday before 
his crucifixion Christ was in the temple. Here certain Pharisees 
questioned him on doctrine, hoping to catch him in his words, and 
make him an offender of the law. Mark tells us that during this day 
a scribe came to him and perceiving! that Jesus answered them well, he 
asked him: "Which is the first commandment of all?" Jesus answered 
him in this manner : 

"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy 
soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength : this is the first com- 
mandment. 

"And the second is like, namely this, thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. 
There is none other commandment greater than these. 

"And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth : for 
there is one God ; and there is none other but he : 

"And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and 
with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbor as himself, 
is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices. 

"And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, Thou art 
not far from the kingdom of God." 

The present business and financial depression has brought with 
it many problems that were unthought of even a few years ago. Many 
Latter-day Saints who have been proud of the fact that they have 
always been givers to the Church through its various organizations are 
now in poverty themselves, and the outlook for the immediate future 



ELDER JOHN WELLS 



33 



is far from being bright. At this time of the year, when families 
need fuel, food, clothing, etc., the bishoprics of this Church are faced 
with a serious problem. They need more funds. The Church is 
expending large sums for benevolent and charitable purposes, and the 
tithes of the Church are being heavily drawn on, in response to urgent 
calls from members of wards who are unemployed. The bishops need 
more funds, more fast offerings, more donations from the members of 
the wards, as well as the splendid assistance of the Relief Societies. 

The Prophet Joseph Smith, finding similar conditions prevailing 
in Kirtland, appointed the first Thursday of each month as a day of 
fasting and prayer. The Saints were notified to come to the meetings 
and bring with them foodstuffs of all kinds which were distributed to 
the poor. After that time it became a fixed routine of the Church to 
hold the fast-day meeting on the first Thursday of each month, for 
the purpose of bearing testimony and putting in practice the teachings 
of the Master concerning our fellow men, by donating funds for the 
poor to be distributed by the bishops. Later, the day was changed to 
the first Sunday of each month. 

There is need in this Church for a revival of the old fast-day habit, 
that is, the habit of fasting and prayer on the first Sunday of each 
month. On this day we should all attend our meetings and bring our 
offerings for the poor, which should be equivalent to the value of 
two meals for each member of the family. This will provide a steady 
fund for the Bishops to use for the support of the worthy poor. We 
have in the Church certain proved methods of gathering and disbursing 
the fast offerings, without expense, and the plan has worked well since 
the institution of fast-day. 

President Brigham Young requested that not only should fathers 
and mothers come to fast meeting, but their children also. Attendance 
at fast meeting will develop in our children the habit of giving, a habit 
which is slowly drifting away from us. We can show no better appre- 
ciation to our Master than by getting back to the habit of giving some- 
thing every fast-day, in order that the Lord's storehouse may be proper- 
ly provided. , J 

Every bishop should see that no member of his ward suffers be- 
cause of the lack of the necessities of life. He should call to his aid 
the Relief Society of his ward and they, at his request, should in- 
vestigate cases of want and suffering and recommend to the bishop 
what, in their judgment, would be the proper course to pursue in each 
individual case or family. 

Those Latter-day Saints who have previously been in the habit 
of giving and who are now unemployed and nearing poverty, should 
have the special consideration of the bishops in these trying times. If 
there is anyone who should have special consideration, it is the faithful 
tithe-payer and his family who are now without employment and in need 
of assistance. 

Certainly, the meals for an ordinary person are worth 10c each. 
If only the cost of one meal were saved and the five hundred thousand 



34 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



members of this Church paid 10c per person on fast day, there would 
be $50,000.00 per month available, which is ample to provide ade- 
quately' for the worthy poor among the Latter-day Saints. Those 
who are able to pay more should follow the old rule, that is, the equiva- 
lent of the cost of two meals per person. 

Benevolence is founded on love for our fellow men. It is more 
far-reaching than charity. Is it not inconsistent for us Latter-day 
Saints to say that we love God whom we have not seen, and love not 
our brother whom we have seen? It is one of the outstanding char- 
acteristics of our Church to take care of our worthy poor, and our 
part in this benevolent duty should not be neglected. All help should 
be given in the spirit of kindness and love for our fellow men. 

In many wards of the Church the deacons are sent to the homes 
of the Saints with an envelope containing a fast offering card. The 
family places in the envelope the amount they desire to pay for the 
support of the worthy poor and then bring the envelope to fast meeting. 
Those who do not attend this meeting are visited by the deacons the 
same day and given an opportunity to contribute. Fast offerings are 
also accepted by the bishop at the meeting house on fast-day. 

A Latter-day Saint who observes the fast-day in its spirit and 
meaning will add to his humility, will develop in his soul a deep heartfelt 
sympathy and love for his fellow men ; he will increase his spirituality 
and his brotherly kindness, and he will be kept in tune with this great 
latter-day work. If we would win eternal life we cannot afford to 
neglect our duty to our fellow men. 

May we, as brothers and sisters in this Church, broaden our sym- 
pathies and during these times of stress be more diligent, attend our 
fast meetings, get the spirit of the occasion, the spirit of testimony. 
May we donate more liberally for the poor, so that there will be enough 
in the Lord's storehouse, or in the possession of the bishops, to feed 
the hungry, clothe the naked, and care for the widow and the orphan, 
so that cries of the distressed shall not ascend unto heaven unan- 
swered. 

Let us demonstrate to the Lord by our works that we are keeping 
the two great commandments, to love him and to love our neighbor. 
May his blessings attend us, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH F. MERRILL 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

Brethren and sisters, since I have been occupying the position of 
Commissioner of Education in the Church, and at these conferences, 
sitting on the back row of these front seats, I have learned that there 
are many anxious seats up this way. Particularly did I observe this 
last April when not until the last session were most of the mission 
presidents called up, Sunday afternoon. They sat through the preced- 
ing sessions, not knowing when they would be called. This morning 
one member of the Council of Twelve said : "Brother Merrill, you need 



ELDER JOSEPH F. MERRILL 



35 



not be worried. You will not be called until Sunday afternoon, after 
your name has been presented for the sustaining vote of the conference." 

A POSITION OF HIGH HONOR 

May I say, brethren and sisters, that a very high honor has come 
to me in the nomination I have received at the hands of the Presidency 
and the Council of the Twelve., to be a member of the Council of the 
Twelve. I regard this as the highest honor that can come to any man. 
Members of this ,Council are called by divine inspiration to a position 
in the Church that requires them to be special witnesses of our Lord 
Jesus Christ, the highest calling that any of us can receive. But, of 
course, before I can be ordained I must receive your sustaining vote. 
I say in all humility this is a wonderful honor. I am overwhelmed with 
it. I cannot fulfil the expectations of the position without hard work, 
without fervent prayer, the sustaining confidence and vote of the mem- 
bership of the Church, and the companionship of the Holy Spirit. 

A KEY TO SUCCESS 

My experience has taught me from my boyhood, that service in 
this Church cannot be acceptably rendered except with the help of 
the Spirit of the Lord, and that this Spirit is given only to the worthy. 
All my life I have been taught that the Lord helps him who helps 
himself. Inasmuch as he has given us intelligence he expects us, 
when any duty is assigned us, to do the very best we can to discharge 
that duty, seeking his help in the meantime. I believe that my experi- 
ence teaches me also that that help may not be received, no matter how 
fervent the prayer, unless the prayer is worthily made. That is to say, 
I must work if I am going to succeed. I must pray, if I am going to 
succeed. All my life I have been taught, and I have experienced the 
fact, that the Lord does answer the prayer of the worthy. Whenever I 
have prayed worthily I have never been disappointed. So I believe in 
prayer. I know that prayer is a source of strength and of help. I have 
proved this many, many times. 

MEN OF DEVOTION 

May I say that this honor that has come to me is very great, 
because the nomination that I have received expresses a confidence in 
me of what I have come to regard as the finest body of men that live. 
My work the last three or four years has brought me more or less into 
intimate contact with the General Authorities of the Church. I have 
learned that they are not only capable men, but they are very much 
devoted to their work; that they are very anxious that this work shall 
go forward as the Lord has intended it should go forward. So their 
lives and their energies are wholly devoted to it. They are also men 
of deep sympathies and great love for their fellowmen. 

I have often remarked that in the position I have been occupying 
since coming to the Church Office Building, nearly four years ago, that 
I have experienced the greatest joys of my life, because I have been 



36 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



contacting with and laboring with people who look at the work from 
one point of view only, the point o£ view of what is best for the whole, 
what is best for the Church. I have not seen a single instance where 
selfishness or selfish interest could be observed at all. These brethren, 
the General Authorities of the Church, are wholly devoted to your 
interests, to the saving of the souls of men. I love them. I have come 
to regard them as God's men. So I feel wholly incapable, my brethren 
and sisters, of being one of their number, because of my unworthiness 
and because of my inability. But I have been honored with the nomina- 
tion. If I am sustained in the position I shall try, as hard as I know 
how to try, to fulfil its obligations. I have no other interests. All my 
time will be devoted to the cause of this Church, forwarding its interests 
and those of the people as best I can. 

HONORED OF GOD 

I spoke of being nominated by the First Presidency and the Council 
of Twelve. I would not have you think for a moment, my brethren 
and sisters, that this is all there js to jit. If this were an honor given 
by men only I would not feel so much overwhelmed by it But it is an 
honor that comes from God. These brethren are only his agents, his 
instruments in the call that has come to me. This is a fact that no 
member of the Church will question who has received a testimony 
of the divinity bf this work. These men are jGod's servants. They 
are his prophets and they enjoy the spirit of their calling. I have had 
so many evidences and so many testimonies of it that I know it to be 
a fact. And in humility and all sincerity I testify to you that it is a 
truth. 

THE YOUNG PEOPLE 

For several years there has been growing in me a feeling that we 
ought to be more and more diligent in our work, particularly with our 
young people. I have been laboring for many years with young people, 
many of whom have been more or less critical, many of whom have 
grown indifferent to the Church ; some of whom have left the Church. 
I have felt that if there is anything possible that I can do, that we can 
do for them, to save them, it ought to be done, because in their veins 
flows the blood of Israel. But if they are to be saved they must 
save themselves, through our help and through the guidance that we 
can give them. No one can save another. He must save himself. 

TESTIMONY THROUGH SERVICE 

Now then, we have been taught, as Brother Wells has said, that 
this is the work of the Lord, and the strength of the Church lies in the 
fact that hundreds and thousands upon thousands of members of the 
Church know that it is the work of the Lord. How do they know it ? 
Not perhaps by some wonderful manifestation, some great miracle. 
They know it because the Spirit of the Lord has come into their souls, 
as a result of their worthiness and their service. If we do the will of 



ELDER JOSEPH F. MERRILL 



37 



God we shall know of the doctrine. I testify, my brethren and sisters, 
that I know that this statement is true, and you know it is true, and 
you have gotten that knowledge because of the service that you have 
rendered. I care not in -what position in the Church service may be 
rendered. Service in any position, no matter how humble, if faithfully 
rendered, brings us a testimony, the witness of the Spirit that this 
great work is divine. 

I was in a meetng last Sunday morning with a group that was 
called to do block teaching in the ward where I live, and I recalled that 
among my earliest experiences in the Church was that of a block 
teacher. When a boy of seventeen, I recall that when I went out with 
my older brother (not a brother by blood, but a brother in the Church) 
and tried to do my duty, I returned home feeling an uplift that 
was truly remarkable in the joy and satisfaction that it brought to me. 
I don't know, my brethren and sisters, that I have ever rendered any 
service in the Church that I enjoyed more, in which I experienced more 
joy and satisfaction, than I did in trying to do my duty as a block 
teacher in the Church. 

So it is all the way along the line. It makes no difference, my 
brethren and sisters, whether we are called to this stand, or whether we 
are serving in the humblest position in the Church. If we do our 
duty, if we serve the Lord and keep his commandments, as we have 
the privilege and the opportunity of doing, we shall for ourselves know 
that we are engaged in the work of the Lord. It is that satisfaction that 
gives strength to the Church and that makes us a body of men and 
women that does not have to rely for direction only upon the General 
Authorities, because if we enjoy the companionship of the Spirit we 
are directed in our own duties, labors and responsibilities. 

KEEP YOUNG PEOPLE IN SCHOOL 

Now, my brethren -and sisters, may I say that we are living in more 
or less distressing times. There is a lot of unemployment. I have been 
engaged primarily in the work with the young people. We are very 
much concerned with this condition of idleness, particularly with the 
young, and so we feel that if we can keep these young people employed 
in school during these times of unemployment, we shall be rendering 
a splendid service to them. So I feel to encourage you parents, who 
are straining every nerve and calling upon every resource that you 
can command to keep your boys and girls in school, to continue doing 
it, for their good. Perhaps enough on that particular point. 

BY KEEPING PHYSICALLY FIT 

It was said this morning that we are trying to keep the Word of 
Wisdom. We have a wonderful course of study this year in the adult 
department of the Mutual Improvement Association, because it is the 
study of the Word of Wisdom, a study of one of the requirements of 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 

To render service we must keep ourselves physically fit. It is 



3N 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



incumbent, therefore, upon every member of the Church who would 
serve, to try to keep physically as well as mentally, morally and spirit- 
ually fit, and that can be done only by right living. God has endowed 
us with intelligence. Let us use it, that we «may know better how to 
live, that we may know better how to serve. 

SECURELY ANCHORED 

Now, brethren and sisters, I have talked long enough. May I 
say that I do hope that, I can function at least in some degree to your 
satisfaction, but may T repeat that if I do, I know it will be because I 
make myself worthy of the sustaining power and help of God. I want 
to testify to you in all sincerity that I know that this is the work of 
God. Elder McKay spoke this morning of being anchored in the faith, 
in the Church. I have felt securely anchored since I was a boy of 
nineteen years. There came to me at that time, as a result of fervent 
prayer, of many prayers uttered through a number of long years, a 
wonderful manifestation that I have believed has been a savior to me. 
T didn't know it at the time, but within three months I was to leave home 
to go to school, and during the succeeding ten years of my life I was en- 
gaged in college and university work. I felt that the manifestation I re- 
ceived at that time was to me an absolute anchor. I cared nothing what 
the teachings of men were, if opposed to the doctrines of the Church, for 
I knew, and have known from that time to this, that the Lord God lives ; 
that he does answer prayer ; that he will sustain those who are worthy 
of being sustained. And this sustenance comes, of course, as a result 
of right living and of sincere service in his cause. 

May the Lord help us to be true to our covenants. May the Lord 
help us to keep our eyes upon these leaders — men of God, I testify to 
you, my brethren and sisters, whose whole hearts are given to the 
fulfilment completely of the obligations that the Lord God has placed 
upon their shoulders in the call that he has made of them. May 
the Lord help us to honor our callings and our positions, whatever 
they may be in the Church, I ask in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JAMES H. MOYLE 

President of the Eastern States Mission 

I am pleased to say that in the Eastern States mission our 
missionaries are enjoying exceptionally good health and that the work 
is progressing, I believe favorably, and I know that prejudice is 
being removed and that we are making many friends. 

In addition to the usual missionary activities we have endeavored 
to use modern methods of reaching the public, with marked, if not 
remarkable, success. Many addresses have been broadcast and hun- 
dreds more would have been delivered if we only had more fairly 
good singers. To my mind, one of the marvelous things that has 
occurred in this work is the fact that all of the 329 sermons broadcast 
over the radio in our mission in less than eighteen months were written 



ELDER JAMES H. MOYLE 



39 



and read by very young and inexperienced boys and girls. Every one 
of them was written by your sons and daughters, with comparatively 
little editing, to the enlightenment and enjoyment of many thousands 
of people. 

Our missionary system is commanding the attention and admira- 
tion of the world. It is a wonderful means of educating your children, 
developing their initiative, broadening their understanding, and giving 
them a better conception of their possibilities. It is sad to hear some 
of our missionaries say that they have been praying and praying that 
they might be permitted to complete their missions, but finally are 
compelled to return home for the want of money. It is a sad mistake 
for a ward or a stake or quorum or wealthy members of the ward to 
permit such missionaries to prematurely end their missions, and especial- 
ly when they have beccfme somewhat efficient and are so anxious to 
remain. They are doing a glorious work for themselves as well as 
others. 

We are also exhibiting the fruits as well as principles of the Gospel 
in fairs and expositions, and these young inexperienced missionaries 
are decorating and equipping attractive booths from which they dis- 
tribute in a day thousands of tracts to people whom they could not 
otherwise reach. We have been successful in securing booths sur- 
rounded with prominent exhibitors, and thus have become the neighbors 
of all kinds of business men who are exhibiting their wares. Their 
frequent contact with our missionaries invariably makes them friendly. 
Our booths are so unusual, and with our fine young men and women 
who radiate the spirit of the Gospel, they arouse unusual interest 
and command respectful consideration. We thereby reach a very 
different class of people from those who ordinarily receive them in 
tracting and street meetings. People in the East, outside of the coun- 
try, largely live in apartment houses and hotels where missionaries 
cannot enter, and in better residences they cannot get past the butler 
or maid. 

Our tracts are distributed free like other advertising matter, and 
.visitors come and carry them away without solicitation. Most of the 
same people would close their doors to our solicitations. 

' Another innovation is carried on through our newly established 
publicity department, through which we make personal contacts with 
newspaper men and thereby secure a greatly enlarged publicity of 
what we are doing and believe, and the same is presented to readers 
in a fair and respectful way. , This makes Mormonism more acceptable 
and respected. 

In this activity, as well as in the radio and exposition work, we 
have no one with any previous experience or training for the work. 
Remarkable as it is, those upon whom the responsibility is placed, 
however seemingly inadequately equipped, are undaunted and go 
at the work in faith with a will, relying on the Lord rather than 
their own ability, with the result that they are getting hundreds of 



40 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



notices and friendly articles published which would otherwise not 
have appeared in the papers. 

But, alas, we have only two-thirds of the missionaries that we 
formerly had. This is even cutting down invaluable opportunities .on 
the radio, as the loss includes some of our best singers. We have no 
professionals. W|e only ask for young people who have fairly good 
voices, whether they have been trained or not. Their voices are more 
attractive there than here at home. 

This is a wonderful work. I enjoy it. It is a great pleasure, and 
nothing have I enjoyed more than the uplifting spiritual influence 
which accompanies it, to discover more thoroughly and fully the depths 
of the truth and philosophy of the Gospel, and to make comparisons 
of it with the religious system's of the world. 

Bishop Wells referred to a most timely scripture today— the dec- 
laration of the Savior that the great commandment in the law was — 

"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy 
soul, and with all thy mind. 

"This is the first and great commandment. 

"And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.'* 
I call especial attention to the next striking statement of the Savior : 
"On these two commandments hang all the law find the prophets." 

The great trouble with the social, industrial, and other systems 
of today is that they are not based upon , either of those great com- 
mandments. If they were there would be a very different brotherhood 
of man existing, which must ultimately come, as no other system 
can be permanent. 

As I recently traveled through the Ohio and Mississippi valleys 
I saw miles of continuous fields with rich harvests of wheat in shocks, 
and corn standing as far as the eye could see ; and yet there is un- 
paralleled poverty stalking in the land. Half of the gold of the world 
is in this nation ; wealth unbounded ; granaries bulging, overflowing 
their capacity ; over-production abounding ; legislation of states to 
prevent the production of the prime necessities of life because of 
super-abundance, — and yet unparalleled poverty on every side. In the 
Latin-American republics there are revolutions ; dictators and revolu- 
tions in Europe ; dynasties falling ; ungodly communism in Russia ; 
threatened socialistic revolutions in Germany and unheard of mutiny 
in the pride and protection of the British Isles — her navy. Nothing, 
practically, but the dole stands between peace and revolution in old 
England, that land of liberty and law observance. In our own country, 
in the great cities, it is not an uncommon sight to see armored cars 
equipped with machine 'guns to protect the transportation of wealth — 
securities and moneys — through the thickly populated streets of the 
city, and from one bank to another. Revolution is threatening this very 
nation because of the unsatisfied demand of the many for social 
justice, or as we would put it, the lack of brotherly love that the Savior 



ELDER JAMES H. MOYLE 



41 



advocated when he said to the wealthy young man, "Give unto the 
poor that which thou hast." Under his inspiration his followers 
established a Christian socialistic system in which there were no poor 
and no rich but all things were held in common. 

That same system was revealed anew and an attempt made to 
establish it by the great prophet of this age, Joseph Smith. Like the 
former day saints they were apparently unable to live it. Then a 
stepping stone to it was established, the ancient law of tithing. My 
missionary experience has revealed to me that which I never fully 
appreciated before, namely ; that the man who pays tithing is a Latter- 
day Saint. They say there are exceptions to all rules, but I haven't 
found an exception to this one yet. I have discovered that when one 
is a partial tithe payer he is only partially a Latter-day Saint, and 
when he doesn't pay any tithing at all he is not a Latter-day Saint, 
because his faith is dead — it being without works. He doesn't under- 
stand the philosophy of the Gospel, or if he does he is too selfish to 
yield obedience to that great beneficent law. The Lord would have us 
give, yes, and give in abundance, and it is only thereby that we are 
going to preserve the peace of the world and this most powerful of 
all nations. The level of intelligence of man is such that the extremes 
of poverty and wealth cannot exist beside each other. The cry of 
the father and husband for work in order that he may have food for 
his family cannot continue long unanswered. There is nothing that 
brings greater satisfaction than being of service to others. The Chris- 
tianity of today must meet the challenge of the many who are weak 
for a greater brotherhood. 

Selfish and weak as we are I nevertheless maintain that we are 
partially meeting that challenge and developing in a notable way real 
evidence of brotherly love through our willingness to render unselfish 
service in going on missions where we give years of our time, and 
great sums of money are spent without earthly compensation. 

Again, our charity system is notable and unparalleled, for by it 
a hundred per cent of that which is contributed to charity goes to the 
object of charity through the unselfish and unpaid-for services of our 
ward teachers and bishops and our splendid woman's Relief Society. 
These are not temporary or spasmodic efforts ; they have continued 
without interruption for a hundred years, and the world is coming 
to give us credit for our response to the needs of the poor. 

Another clearly unselfish service is the vicarious work for the 
dead — doing something for those who can make no earthly return. 
The breadth and depth of that saving work is hardly fathomable. It is 
an unselfish earthly service, nobly conceived and unselfishly performed. 

What other people are attempting such altruistic brotherly love 
effort? 

Can we not point with pride to this evidence of being imbued 
with the spirit of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and are we not an example 
in these respects at least, of making progress in the accomplishment 
of the purposes of the Lord; to which might appropriately be added 



42 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



the payment of tithing, which I think is one of the surest tests of 
sincerity and honesty. 

Another unique conception and practice is characteristic of Latter- 
day Saints, namely, the Fast Day donation, or contribution of the 
value of the morning and noonday meal on the first Sunday of each 
month for the relief of the poor. Greater stress could be appropriately 
placed upon its observance, as fasting is good for the body, as is also 
the giving, for the soul. 

If that practice, common to us for a hundred years, were followed 
by all in the United States at 25c per meal or 50c per month for each 
individual, it would eliminate the cry for bread. Fifty cents a month 
from a hundred million would be fifty million per month or six hun- 
dred million per year, which if conserved in prosperous years, for 
years of scarcity, would remove the possibility of extreme poverty. 

We have had ever since the days of the children of Israel in Egypt 
years of plenty and years of scarcity, and they will probably continue 
to come, and suffering will exist where there might be plenty, until 
that system of which I speak is established in the earth, and which 
I believe is nearer at hand than we realize. 

Out of this great financial distress there should come some great 
good. Nothing could be better than a greater brotherhood, a better 
comprehension of the responsibilities and duties of the strong to the 
weak. We are our brother's keeper, and those who are strong and 
able and more richly endowed with the ability to do good and to 
accomplish the most in this life, whether physically, industrially, social- 
ly or religiously, must help those who are weak. That is the greatest 
problem that now confronts the world. 

May the Lord help us to so live that we can enjoy his Spirit. 
I never was happier, I never enjoyed myself so much when striving 
only for selfish interests as I do now in working for the great cause 
of human redemption. His Spirit has been with me in this great 
and glorious work. It has enabled me to solve problems that I ap- 
parently could not see through and which looked dark indeed. I have 
gone to bed at night puzzled, but with a prayer for light and help, 
and have awakened in the morning with an understanding" as clear 
as the noonday sun. 

The Lord is blessing this work and those who give to its service 
their whole hearts, souls and minds. May he help us to so live that 
we may enjoy the companionship of his Spirit at all times, and have 
that joy and peace which accompanies it, and which I have experienced 
during the last two years and nine months of my life, I pray, in the 
name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER CHARLES E. ROWAN, JR. 

President of the Texas Mission 

My brethren and sisters, I rejoice in this opportunity that I have 
of being here at this wonderful conference. Another evidence, to my 



ELDER CHARLES E. ROWAN,, JR. 



43 



mind, that God is still guiding his people, is the nomination of Dr. 
Merrill to become one of the apostles of our Church. 

I am happy to bring greetings to you people from the saints 
and missionaries in the Texas mission, and I am happy to say to you, 
brethren and sisters, that with but one exception all of our missionaries 
are enjoying health and strength, and so far as I know, every missionary 
in that mission is enjoying the Spirit of the Lord and enjoying the 
missionary work. I have had an opportunity of visiting^ with every 
one of them within the last sixty days, and I rejoice, my brethren 
and sisters, as I hear them bear their solemn testimonies to the people, 
and hear them expound the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. It is an 
evidence to me that there is still power in the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints. 

I am happy to say to you that we are making many friends among 
those who have prestige and influence. I find that it is an advertise- 
ment to announce to the people of Texas and Louisiana that you are 
a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 

I am indeed grateful to my Heavenly Father for his many blessings. 
If I should be called upon to spend all the days of my life in the 
mission field, or in his service, I would not be able to repay him for 
his kindness to me. I am indeed grateful to him, brethren and sisters, 
for the fact that I was called on a mission twenty-eight years ago ; 
that I had the pleasure of learning the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ 
in the Southern States, under President Ben E. Rich ; that I had an 
opportunity to travel without purse or scrip, and that I had many things 
to be thankful for. I am grateful to my Heavenly Father for the 
testimony that I received at that time, and as I go forward now as a 
missionary in the great state of Texas, I find there is a different 
feeling, a different attitude among the people generally, and that very 
largely because we are becoming better understood. 

May I read to you just a moment from the scripture: 

"A good name is rather to be chosen than great riches, and loving favor 
rather than gold and silver. 

"The rich and the poor meet together. The Lord is maker of them all. 
By humility and the fear of the Lord are riches and honor and life." 

I have yet one individual to meet, who has been out in this country 
as a tourist and met our people, that has not been friendly, because 
they have discovered that our people, in the main, are honest ; and the 
good name that you are establishing is making it possible for us to get 
into the homes of the people in the mission field. 

So I rejoice, my brethren and sisters, in this great calling, and 
as I study the Book of Mormon, as I read the revelations contained 
in the book of Doctrine and Covenants, and as I read the Pearl of 
Grea.t Price, my testimony becomes stronger, and I feel that there is 
abundant evidence to prove that Joseph Smith was indeed a prophet 
of God. I am happy to say to you, brethren and sisters, that your 
boys and girls are well and happy; that I am trying as hard as I can 



44 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



to protect and safeguard their health; that I am trying to stimulate 
them to see the possibilities of the great vision of life that is before 
them; and that I am trying to impress upon them the seriousness 
and sacredness of the call which they have received from the Priest- 
hood to proclaim this Gospel. I have enjoyed myself immensely. 
Never before in my life have I done anything that I have enjoyed 
so much as I have laboring as a missionary in that part of the Lord's 
vineyard. m 

I am happy to say, brethren and sisters, that these men whom we 
sustain as our Authorities are beloved by our people ; that they respect 
them; that they reverence them. -Our people generally are a praying 
people, and as they pray night and morning they pray that our Heavenly 
Father will guide and direct these men whom we sustain as our prophets, 
seers and revelators ; and I feel confident in my heart that he is guiding 
them. I hope and trust that you people will recognize the important 
positions that you occupy here in Zion ; that you will live your religion, 
so that when tourists and strangers come among you they will see that 
you are indeed a chosen people. As you treat them with honor and 
with respect, and as your lives are reflected in the things that you do, 
you will make it possible for your sons and daughters to reach their 
hearts. 

May the Lord bless you. May you realize the importance of a 
good name, and may you keep alive the spirit that you received when 
you were confirmed members of this Church, and may we ultimately 
all come back into his presence to live and grow, is my prayer, and I 
ask it in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER WILLIAM R. SLOAN 

President of the Northwestern States Mission 

"Then, say, what is truth? Tis the last and the first, 

For the limits of time it steps o'er : 
Though the heavens depart, and the earth's fountains burst, 
Truth, the sum of existence will weather the worst, 

Eternal, unchanged, evermore." 

We have been listening to those gems of truth this afternoon, 
and my heart has been made to rejoice in the testimonies of my brethren. 

During the summer just past, we took to the Alberta Temple 
400 members of our mission to enjoy the blessings Of that holy house, 
many of them driving as far as 1200 miles distance there and 1200 
miles back. One of our brethren whose health was impaired and who 
had been unable to work for years, his wife prevailed on him to go to 
the temple. "iWe can't both go," she said, "but you go and get a bless- 
ing." The malady with which this brother was afflicted doctors pro- 
nounced incurable. He went to the temple and spent two days with 
us. The third morning he left for home, traveling 150 miles. They 
stopped at a hotel, and he said to one of our missionary elders: "I 
went all this distance for a blessing and I am going home without it." 



ELDER WILLIAM R. SLOAN 



45 



The Elder said, "Why brother, you can't go home without it, let us 
drive back tomorrow morning and get your blessing." You will re- 
member brethren and sisters, that when Peter and John were entering 
the temple, a poor man, born with an infirmity, lay at the gates 
pleading for alms; and as Peter and John entered they looked upon 
him, and Peter said : "Silver and gold have I none, but such as I have 
give I thee : In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk," 
and he was made whole. So this brother said, "In the morning we 
will go back." 

They drove back and they entered the temple. The President laid 
his hands upon this brother's head and said, "Brother, this malady, 
this disease, will drop from your body as a robe being discarded, and 
you will be made well." 

I was in Klamath Falls only a few weeks ago and shook hands 
with this good brother and his good wife, and he said: "President 
Sloan, I never was better physically in my life, than I am today." He 
too was made whole. 

"Sacrifice, my brethren and sisters, brings forth blessings. 

I bring greetings to you from the missionaries in the Northwest 
and from the far off land of Alaska. Some of you have very vague 
ideas regarding Alaska — its climatic condition and size. If you could 
transport it and set it down in the United States, it would cover almost 
the entire country. That is the size of Alaska. As to climatic 
conditions, some call it Seward's icebox, but our missionaries have 
been holding street meetings during the winter months in Juneau, 
Ketchikan, and Wrangell, with success. We need experienced mission- 
aries in Alaska. You brethren who can afford the finances, and who have 
had experience, here is a glorious opportunity. Your sons and daughters 
in the Northwest are marvelous boys and girls; and, fathers and 
mothers, their love for you is becoming intensified every day they remain 
in the mission. They love you for that which you are doing for them. 

We released a splendid lady missionary not long ago. Her home is 
in Cardston. When she arrived there with the caravan, they drove 
to the temple first, circled around the city for a few minutes, and then 
she said, "I want you to drive me out to the cemetery." They did so, 
and there, on the arm of her companion, she stood over the graves 
of her deceased father and mother, to give her first report of the 
missionary labors she had performed, hoping for this privilege, and 
now ready to go forth and discharge her greater responsibility. 

I pray the Lord to bless us in this work, to bless these men who 
preside ; may we sustain them with our faith and prayers and our 
confidence I pray, in the name of Jesus, Amen. 

ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

I am very grateful that I can believe in spiritual realities. It is not 
difficult for me now to accept the statements of my brethren and sisters 



46 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



as to their knowledge of the Gospel, as to the goodness of the Lord to 
them. I can believe that there are powers beyond the material manifes- 
tations of man's intellect and his force. I am grateful that God has 
made it possible for me to recognize the presence of his Holy Spirit. 
I cannot contemplate complete happiness in life without that recogni- 
tion. 

TOLERANT TOWARD OTHERS 

While I am grateful for these blessings to myself, I am aware that 
there are many men in the world who do not have similar blessings. 

They do not believe in spiritual realities. They do not understand 
the operation of the Spirit. Their heart's do not respond to impressions 
that come from divine sources. I regard it as unfortunate that it 
may be so, but I do not abuse men wh|o have not such realization. 
I do not attempt to pass judgment upon them. I desire to be tolerant 
and merciful in my feelings toward them. 

INFLUENCES THAT PERPLEX 

It is in my heart today to plead for tolerance. Not all of us are 
raised in the same environment. Not all of mankind are subjected to 
the same influences. We who have been fortunate enough to have our 
souls touched with the testimony of Jesus, ought to be very compassion- 
ate with those who have not had such manifestations. I recognize that 
in the educational processes of the day there are to be found many factors 
which militate against spiritual training. Theories of men — and I do 
not deprecate them, because they are often founded upon the best investi- 
gations that men are able to makef — are advanced for the solution of 
life's problems, and in answer to questions that perplex youth. They 
who are subjected to these educational processes and to the teachings 
of the day, are not altogether to be blamed because these teachings appeal 
to them ; and they ultimately come to place reliance upon the philoso- 
phies, the systems and the theories which are advanced. 

RELIANCE UPON REASON 

The youth of today are taught to reason. Their intellects are highly 
trained, and they rely upon their reason. I know, and you know, that 
if their minds can but be kept open to the reception of spiritual truth,' 
such truth may be made to appear reasonable to them ; but they demand 
reason. I would like them to have reason. I would like them to under- 
stand the beauties of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. I would like them to 
come to feel the glorious impressions that a true conception of the 
Gospel brings, but I know that I cannot force them to these impressions. 
I know that our work is not one of coercion or of compulsion. I know 
that it is only by sympathetic, intelligent persuasion that the minds 
of youth, the intelligence, the reason, the sophisticated minds of youth 
can be made to ultimately comprehend the glories of the revealed truths 
of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. I plead for some tolerance in their 
treatment. 



ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS

SYMPATHY IN TEMPTATION 

I recognize that in the temptations that are presented to them they 
are obliged to exercise tremendous resistance, if they would keep them- 
selves clean and spotless from the sins of the world. I know that 
sometimes they have not the courage to resist, and that unfortunately 
many fall victims to systems of enticement, the like of which all the 
world has never known before. In their fall they have my sympathy, 
and I trust that they may have the sympathy of the Church. 

THE GOSPEL'S GREATER MISSION 

I know that we inveigh — and rightly soi — against the ills to which 
they are subject. We urge that they do not use tobacco, tea and coffee, 
and liquor. We point out in strong terms the consequences which ensue 
from an infraction of the Word of Wisdom, given of God. We en- 
gage in a great campaign to ban these evils from the Church, and it is 
well that we do so. But in our ardor, in our enthusiastic endeavor to 
prevent our youth from falling into these sins, God help us not to 
drive them out of the pale of the Church. The Lord help us not to 
ostracise them from our companionship and the saving grace of the 
merciful principles of the Gospel of our Lord and our Savior. I never 
want a youth who unfortunately takes to the habit of smoking to come 
to feel that he cannot enter with welcome the doors of our churches 
and the association of our church people. If there is ever a time when 
one needs the influence of the Church it is when, in the frailty of his 
human nature, he has transgressed a law of God and fallen from the 
standard of righteousness. I know that it might perhaps be misunder- 
stood but I cannot help saying that I want the youth of this Church 
to come to know and understand that this great system of righteousness, 
the Gospel, is something more than just a mere campaign against tea, 
coffee and tobacco — important as is the abstinence from those noxious 
poisons to the human family. 

Oh, I think so much of the glorious light of truth that God has 
given, of the great exaltation that he holds out to us, to come back into 
his presence by living the Gospel, that I would not have our youth miss 
the epitome of it all, the prime essentials, the glorious hopes, the rewards, 
the promises, that await those who live' the truth and conform their lives 
to the teachings of the Church. I would like them all to know, how- 
ever, that whenever one fails to keep a commandment he cuts himself 
off from so much of the glorious blessings which God has promised 
to the faithful. 

TEMPERATE IN JUDGMENT 

This is a church of free agency. Man may choose for himself. • 
We are to disseminate the knowledge, that he may choose wisely. When 
we have done that adequately our duty is performed. 

"Judge not, that ye be not judged," are said to be the most merciful 
words in all the world. We are not set to be the judges of our brethren, 
except in special cases. God is their judge. We are not always aware 



48 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



of the feelings that prompt them. We do not always know the 
temptations which beset them. We cannot always correctly judge of 
the struggles which they have. May we be temperate in our judgments. 
Sometimes I find myself failing to distinguish between' resentment at 
the sin and hatred toward the sinner. There is a pronounced distinc- 
tion. We are not to compromise with truth. It has been given to us 
to preserve in its undiluted purity and beauty. 

I believe in the orthodox teachings of this Church. I do not 
equivocate about them, nor attempt 1 to explain away the requirements 
of the Gospel of Christ. But I want the Lord to give me sympathy 
and mercy and forbearance toward him who, in the weaknesses of the 
flesh, may not always sustain these standards and principles. So, to the 
leaders of the Church, the men and the women who guide the organiza- 
tions of this great institution, I sincerely appeal to you to be considerate 
and merciful in your judgments, and to go, like the Savior, out to those 
who are sick, and bring them in for treatment, and not confine the func- 
tions and offices of the Church only to those who are spiritually well. 

I pray that God will give us all wisdom and inspiration to deal with 
our families as we should, to assist in the salvation of the families of 
others, and to ever keep within our own hearts, as well as within the 
portals of our churches, a welcome for him who has fallen, as well as for 
him whom God has blessed with purity and uprightness of living. Amen. 

The congregation sang the hymn, "Guide us, O thou great Jehovah." 
Elder Andrew Jenson, Assistant Church Historian, pronounced 
the benediction. 

Conference adjourned until 10 o'clock Saturday morning, October 
3, 1931. 



SECOND DAY 



MORNING MEETING 

Conference reconvened Saturday morning, October 3, 1931, at' 10 
o'clock. 

President Heber J. Grant presided. 

The congregation sang the hymn "Though Deep'ning Trials." 
The opening prayer was offered by Elder David R. Langlois, Presi- 
dent of the Burley .Stake. 

The congregation sang the hymn, "Our mountain home so dear." 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

The words of the first hymn that we sang this morning are by 
Sister Eliza R. Snow, who at one time was President of the Relief 
Societies of the Church. The music was composed by Brother 
George Careless. The words of the hymn we have just sung are 
by Sister Emmeline B. Wells, one of the successors to Sister Snow 
in the presidency of the ( Relief Societies. The music to this hymn 
was composed by the late Evan Stephens. 

Personally, I am very grateful for the wonderful inspiration of 
our brethren and sisters who have written the words and composed 
the music for so many of our inspired hymns. 

ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE. 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

There is reason for gratification in finding one's self a member 
of a goodly company. We can say, as yesterday many said in their 
hearts, and as it has been said aforetime, "Lord, it is good for us to be 
here." 

If we put into action the admonition of which we often sing — 
count our many blessings, one by one — we surely shall be surprised 
at what the Lord has done and is doing for us. Among the blessings 
for which we should be devoutly thankful is the privilege of thus 
assembling from time to time, in local or in general capacity, to be 
taught, especially to be reminded, for we have been taught personally 
through the many years and indirectly by recorded scriptures through 
the centuries ; but we are apt to forget. 

I note at these conferences a striking feature in the matter of the 
addresses that are given, in that each speaker leaves something that may 
serve as a rich text for those who follow him ; and thus the instructions 
are cumulative, leading on step by step. 

SANCTITY OF THE LORD'S NAME 

The grand summation of the whole duty of man, as presented 



50 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



by the President in his opening address, can not be too closely taken 
to heart — that we strive to keep the commandments of the ^ Lord. 
.Among those commandments one in my mind at this moment is that 
written amidst the awe-inspiring glory of Sinai: "Thou shalt not 
take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord will not 
hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain." 

The word translated into our language as "vain" is an interesting- 
one, and its usage is instructive. "In vain" is about the only phrase 
and' marks .about the only occurrence in the English language in which 
the word "vain" is used as a noun. It is an adjective in common 
usage. It comes to us from a Latin root and meant, originally, empty 
and void, and as the lexicographers tell us, that meaning has been 
maintained through all its variations. 

To take the name of God in vain, therefore, is to use that name 
lightly, to use it emptily, to use it without effect, so far as the intent 
is concerned — but nevertheless, with awful effect upon the profane 
user. We are apt to think that this has reference to the speaking of 
the name of God only, and in that particular respect the commandment 
is sufficiently weighty and important to us. Profanity is all too common 
in the world — profanity of speech. 

PROFANITY IN SPEECH 

But beyond this there is profanity of action, which is of greater 
import than the spoken word, even as the prayer of the heart is greater 
than the prayer of the lips. Profanity in this sense is any manifestation 
of disrespect or irreverence for the name of God ; blasphemy consists 
in attributing to Deity any unworthy act or motive, or in claiming for 
one's self the distinguishing attributes of Deity. 

I listen with horror to profane swearing. One can not. escape 
it wholly, go where one will; that is to say, ,as,one has to meet diverse 
associations one is sure to encounter it. Of profanity I have not yet 
heard one word of defense. It is wholly demoralizing, wholly base, 
to say nothing of the sacrilege and blasphemy ofttimes associated 
in the linking of the name of Deity with our perverse expressions. 

I call to mind that Chapin has given us a thought in regard to the 
use of profanity. "Profaneness," he wrote, "is a brutal vice. He 
who indulges in it is no gentleman. I care not what his stamp may 
be in society, or what clothes he wears, or what culture he boasts. 
Despite all his refinement, the light and habitual taking of God's name 
in vain betrays a coarse and brutal will." 

And yet another has said : "Profanity never did any man the least 
good. No man is the richer or happier or wiser for it. It commends 
no one to society. It is disgusting to the refined, abominable to the 
good, insulting to those with whom we associate, degrading to the mind, 
unprofitable, needless and injurious to society." 

Perhaps some of you may think my remarks are inept in this 
particular presence. I do not believe that the habitual taking of the 



ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE 



51 



name of God in vain by profane speech is a prevalent .vice among the 
Latter-day Saints. I refer to this in passing, only, as one way in which 
the name of God is all too frequently polluted among men in general. 
But there is much beyond and behind that. Profanity of the lips, I 
repeat, is not the only form in which this offense appears. 

ENORMITY OF FALSE SWEARING 

The name of God is a means of power. He is jealous — that is to 
say, righteously zealous of his name, because of that for which his 
name stands. "And ye shall not swear by my name falsely," he , spoke 
through his prophet of old, as is written in the book of the law, "Neithev 
shalt thou profane the name of thy God. I am the Lord." (Lev. 19 :12.) 

But, one may say, those commandments were given in the days 
when the law, as distinguished from the Gospel, was dominant. Very 
true. The people then had to be led by the code of "Thou shalt" and 
"Thou shalt not," until under the tutelage of the law, as under the 
direction of a schoolmaster, they were brought, once erring children, 
to a state of preparation for the reception of the Gospel. 

But the principle involved is an eternal one. The name of God is 
and will ever be honored in the heavens beyond, as it is required 
that we honor it here upon the earth, and he honors his own name and 
rightly demands that we honor it also. 

But another phase of taking the name of God in vain is that 
referred to in the scripture just cited : "And ye shall not swear by my 
name falsely." How that is disregarded in the world we know. In the 
courts of the land, yes, I will say, with reservation, in the courts of 
justice, the oath is administered, "So help you God," and we witness 
every day practically, instances of such solemn adjuration being disre- 
garded as soon as spoken; we see men perjuring themselves, defiling, 
polluting the name of God even on the witness stand. W]e have come 
to think that perjury in our courts is something to be condoned, palli- 
ated, and in some minds extolled, if by it some personal advantage 
can be gained. 

USING THE HOLY NAME PRESUMTUOUSLY 

I ask your attention to another way by which the name of God is 
taken in vain, and that by the presumption of men who profess to speak 
in his name without authority. The Lord has been particularly careful 
as to those whom he commissions to use his name, may I say, officially, 
and having thus commissioned a man, or any being, man or angel, to 
speak in his name, he, the Lord, holds himself bound by what is 
done by that agent if it is done righteously in his holy name. 

I pray you call to mind that striking instance of the Lord's word 
to Israel as the hosts were journeying through the wilderness of old. 
He told them what he had done for them and what he would continue 
to do for them, and appointed one to represent him, and said unto Israel : 

"Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring 
thee into the place which I have prepared. 



52 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



"Beware of him, and obey his voice, Jprovoke him not ; for he will not pardon 
your transgressions: for my name is in him." (Exo. 23:20, 21.) 

Having thus placed his name in men for the accomplishment of 
his purposes, he has uttered words of warning time and again lest it be 
defiled. 

"For I will not suffer my name to be polluted, and I will not give my glory 
unto another." (I Nephi 20:11.) 

In the days of the Gospel restoration in the meridian of time the 
word of the Lord was given unto the people to regard the sanctity of 
the name of God. Did not the Christ teach in that prayer of prayers 
that we should address our Father with the words of praise, "Hallowed 
be thy name," as of old he had declared through the Psalmist, "Holy 
and reverend is his name?" Unto those who had undertaken to falsely 
assume to speak in the name of God the Lord has uttered warnings in 
ancient times as in this age and dispensation. Consider these words, 
given by the Lord through his prophet, in August, 1831 : 

"Behold, I am Alpha and Omega, even Jesus Christ. 

"Wherefore, let all men beware how they take my name in their lips — 

"For behold, verily I say, that many there be who are under this condem- 
nation, who use the name of the Lord, and use it in vain, having not authority. 

"Wherefore, let the Church repent of their sins, and I, the Lord, will own 
them ; otherwise they shall be cut off. 

"Remember that that which cometh from above is sacred, and mus.t be 
spoken with ca;re, and by constraint of the Spirit; and in this there is no con- 
demnation, and ye receive /the Spirit through prayer ; wherefore, without this 
there remaineth condemnation." (D. and C. 63:60-64.) 

Yet in this day there are men who rise up and avow as in the 
name of the Lord that they have received his word, and actually pre- 
sume to declare it unto the people as the word of God given by au- 
thority. But in the, next section, sixty-four, as we have it recorded, 
the Lord again spoke: 

"For it shall come to pass that the inhabitants of Zion shall 'judge all things 
pertaining to Zion. 

"And liars and hypocrites shall be proved by them, and they who are not 
apostles and prophets shall be known." (D. and C. 64:38, 39.) 

WE BEAR THE LORD'S NAME 

And now there is yet another instance, method, way by which we 
are too prone to take the name of God in vain and in this connection I 
call your attention to the thirtieth chapter of Proverbs, verses seven to 
nine inclusive, and ask you to heed these words, the words of Agur, the 
son of Jakeh, speaking from the fulness of his heart: 

"Two things have I required of thee; deny me them not before I die: 
"Remove far from me vanity and lies : give me neither poverty nor riches ; feed 

me with food convenient for me : 

"Lest I be full and deny thee, and say, Who isf the Lord? or lest I be poor, 

and steal, and take the name of my God in vain." 

What association is there between the crime of theft and that of 



ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE 



53 



taking the name of God in vain, so closely brought together here ? Lest 
I steal, and thereby take the name of God in vain — making it a double 
crime. Do we take the name of God in vain by stealing? Latter-day 
Saints, this applies to us. Is not the name of the Lord written in our 
foreheads ? Where can a Latter-day Saint go without bearing the name 
of the Lord with him? And if he steal, he is stealing before the Lord, 
and with his name displayed, thus polluting" the name of the Lord, for 
he has taken that name upon himself. 
By way of summary : 

1. We may take the name of God in vain by profane speech. 

2. We take it in vain when we swear falsely, not being true to our 
oaths and promises. 

3. We take it in vain in a blasphemous sense when we presume 
to speak in that name without authority. 

4. And we take his name in vain whenever we wilfully do aught 
that is in defiance of his commandments, since we have taken his name 
upon ourselves. 

Can we pray that prayer of Agur, the son of Jakeh: "Give me 
neither poverty nor riches" ? The first part of it I think we can. None 
of us welcome poverty. But can we pray the prayer? We can say it, 
but that may not be praying. Lord, give me neither poverty nor riches 
beyond my power to bear. Do not send poverty that may lead me to 
steal. I fear I can not bear it. Lord, send me not riches that may 
make me full of conceit so that I spurn thee and say, Who is the Lord ? 
But feed me with food suited to my condition that I may develop 
and be thy son in very deed. 

Latter-day Saints let us remember the word of God, we must not 
take the name of the Lord our God in vain, for surely he will not hold 
us guiltless if we take his name in vain. 

That we may speak and act, live and serve in his name, I fervently 
pray. Amen. 

ELDER ARTHUR WELLING 

President of the North Central States Mission 

My brethren and sisters, I am proud to be a missionary of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and am very pleased to be 
able to report for the North Central States mission that all of our 
missionaries are well and busy and happy in their work. 

When Jesus was asked by Pilate whether he were king of the 
Jews a part of his answer was : 

"For this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the 
truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice." 

We like to feel, in a modest, humble way, like that — that for this 
cause came we into the world, that we might testify of the truth that 
God, our Father in heaven, lives ; that Jesus, our elder brother, glorious- 
ly resurrected, lives ; that these two heavenly beings have condescended 
to again appear in these last days to our Prophet, and have taught 



54 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



him concerning the things necessary to life and salvation. 

We are not in the world to find fault with those who find it diffi- 
cult to believe as we would like to have them believe. Ours is not a 
message of criticism nor of argument, but we do love to testify in 
deep humility of what we believe to be the truth. 

Like the brethren who have reported here, we find friendship 
everywhere taking the place of misinformation and prejudice of the 
past'. We rejoice in the wonderfully beneficial effects of radio broad- 
casts from this city and the impressions made upon tourists who visit 
here. The world is full of our friends, but, my brethren and sisters, 
in spite of that, it seems to me the work of carrying the message of 
Mormonism to the world is just begun. They find it difficult to believe 
as we believe about the things which we regard as fundamental to 
life and salvation. ! 

Like the other brethren, we too have been on the air a few times 
in a modest way, and we have tried one small exhibit at a fair, with 
satisfactory results ; but in the main we are plodding along, trying to 
reach the people personally, individually, in their homes, in their cot- 
tage meetings ; trying to find an opportunity, where they have radios 
perhaps, to arrange a little group meeting in which they may listen 
to the Tabernacle Organ, or the Tabernacle Choir, or one of the 
speakers of the General Authorities here at home ; and by such methods 
as that to reach the homes and the hearts of the people, for there are 
many who like to hear more about the truth. 

I would like to tell you a lot about things in our mission, if time 
permitted, but I know it does not. I Would just like to say, in passing, 
that if heaven holds no joy — should we ever be fortunate enough to 
reach there — greater than the joy I have in trying to preach the Gospel, 
or teach the people what we understand the Gospel to be, I shall be 
perfectly happy and satisfied. 

I love the people with whom it is my privilege and honor to as- 
sociate. I love the work. It is the most satisfying thing I have ever 
yet found. 

I want to waive that thought, however, for a very brief reference, 
if I may, to what has been mentioned several times already — the times 
of stress in which we live. There is a little angle to that to which 
I would like to devote attention. Blessings of adversity — I like to 
thmk that. Do you remember the story of the marriage feast? I 
won't take time to repeat it . but it seems to me we are approaching 
conditions like that. The man who before must prove the oxen which 
he had bought, or must go to inspect the farm which he had lately 
purchased, has time now, if we approach him in a right spirit, to listen 
to some of the things we. would like him to listen to. 

Those who are lovers of Dickens' works will remember the lines 
with which he opens The Tale of Two Cities : "It was the best of times ; 
it was the worst of times," and so on. And I submit, my brethren — 
particularly those who preside — it seems to me we are facing con- 
ditions like that now. We learned yesterday that this is a good time 



ELDER ARTHUR WELLING

to pursue our educational work here at home. I ask you, in real 
sincerity, if you do not think it may also 'be a good time for missionary 
work, not only from the standpoint of the people of the world who 
have a little more time to listen, but from the standpoint of the men to 
be sent out from Zion to teach the truth. Most of us have to wear 
clothes and eat some food whatever we do, and many of our young 
people spend a little money here and there one way and another. If they 
are not in school and if they are not wage-earners, contributing some- 
thing to the much needed funds of the family, would it be very much 
more expensive to maintain them in the mission field than here at home ? 
We are constantly striving for economy, both of means and of time — 
the few there are of us, only fifty-one or fifty-two — in the mission 
in which I serve, and there are millions of people to be reached. And 
so we believe that economy of both time and means is a cardinal virtue. 
"Dost thou love life," wrote Franklin, "then do not squander time; for 
it is the stuff life is made of." And in these trying times we emphasize 
economy of means as well. I would therefore like to urge upon you 
consideration of the question if this be not also a good time, from the 
standpoint of the expense involved, for missionary work. 

And now, in conclusion, with apologies to General Foch. These 
blessings of adversity, of which there are plenty — drouth, unemploy- 
ment, grass-hoppers, and all — we have experienced them in the 
North Central States mission; but, although, as the Marshal said, 
his right was in retreat, and his left was broken, and his center was 
wavering, and so on — so it may be with us. We suffer under the con- 
tinued depression and unemployment, and we are withering under the 
blight of the drouth, and we are still, as is perhaps the case in all the 
world, struggling against doubt and uncertainty and depression. But, 
my brethren and sisters, the situation is excellent, as the General said. 
So far as we are concerned we shall attack, not in criticism, not mili- 
tantly, but in deep humility and in testimony of the truth, for which we 
go into the world. And may the Lord add his blessings and speed the 
right, we humbly pray in the- name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

A vocal solo, "My faith in Thee," was rendered by Sister Lottie 
Spencer Davis. 

ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL 

Of the First Council of Seventy 

I feel more like saying, this morning, "Cheer up, the worst is to 
come." All I know, brethren and sisters, is what I feel, what I sense, 
what I hear and what I see. I know of no better way to make this clear 
to you than to relate an incident that happened in my missionary 
experience, at the time I was appointed to preside over the Southern 
States mission. I succeeded Elder William Spry. There was only 
a few days notice given me. The brethren failed to inquire regarding 
my financial condition, my wife and children, my physical condition, 
or whether my teeth were all right, etc. ; they just appointed me 



56 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



without asking me any questions, and I had faith enough to go. The 
itinerary was made out by Elder Spry to visit those conferences which 
occurred only once a year, as the mission covered eleven states. We 
had the means to go through that mission only once a year. In 
fact, when Elder Spry turned the mission over to me he handed me 
thirty-five dollars. I said: "Is that all you've got?" 
"Yes." 

"How do you get your money?" 

"Why, we go to the Lord and ask him." 

"Well," I said, "I don't think he is very liberal." (Laughter) 

The first conference appointed was in West Virginia. I rode all 
day and all night on the train, and we took no berths in those days. 
I arrived at Crow's Nest. It is the only place I remember in the South, 
because it was so lonely and desolate. The Elders who were to meet 
me had returned because the train was six or seven hours late, so I had 
to find my way to the conference as best I could. I wasn't very well. 
I climbed the mountain and stopped with a coal miner. He treated 
me very kindly. The next morning I started for the conference. I 
had not then received the spirit of my appointment. As I approached 
the top of another mountain I went into the woods to pray and I told 
the Lord all about it. I don't think I have been able to pray like that 
since. When I got through praying, I did not see anything; I failed 
to hear anything, but there was something came over me, a happiness, 
a joy, that it isn't possible for mortal man to express. I suppose it 
was a heavenly feeling; I was actually so overjoyed and so happy 
that I whistled. I haven't whistled since. The twenty miles that I 
walked was the happiest time I have ever had. That is how I felt. 
I know because I was clothed upon with the Holy Spirit. I have 
regretted more than I can express that the same sensation has not 
come to me with the same power since. 

I had another experience. It was prior to my going on this 
mission. We were involved in speculation. If we had had our way 
we would have owned a large holding in Canada. We got into that 
mess. After having gone through that experience we were as near hell 
as a man will ever get if he is honest. An honest man is in hell when 
he is in debt. I know all about the feeling. I went through the mill of 
the gods, and it grinds slowly, but it grinds fine. If you have anything 
left when they get through with you, you have had a happier experience 
than I have had. s 

Well, it was on that occasion that I made a public declaration in 
the Logan tabernacle — foolish it may have been. We were able to pay 
all our personal obligations, although it took everything we had in the 
world — years of hard work, fifteen years in Bear Lake pioneering — 
and we exchanged it all for a 320 acre farm in Cache valley. We had 
two hundred acres of grain and one hundred tons of hay, all ready 
for harvest, and were sold out at the court house door for thirty-eight 
hundred dollars and a thousand dollar judgment. That farm some 
years afterwards was sold by David Eccles, who became the owner of 



ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL 



57 



it, for thirty thousand dollars. I speak of this so that you will under- 
stand the dream. 

After making my declaration in the Logan tabernacle, that I would 
never doff my hat and be servile to any man because of his money, 
that night I had a dream. I am not a dreamer ; I believe in dreams 
when they come true, and I haven't any use for them until they do. 
It was very vivid. I haven't forgotten it, and it has been nearly forty 
years since it occurred. I have not repeated it but a few times. The 
devil appeared to me at the northeast corner of the Temple block. 
I was not very well acquainted with the devil. Brother Maeser used 
to tell us he was a great general ; the man that I saw, and I seemed 
to know he was Satan, was of great personality in appearance, in 
height and bigness ; he was dark and swarthy and seemed to be a real 
man. When he looked at me with those black eyes they pierced me to 
the soul. I trembled as I did in the woods when I was filled with the 
Holy Spirit of God. I trembled from head to heels with fear. He 
repeated what I had said at the Logan tabernacle. The Spirit of God 
came on me and thrilled me from crown to toe. I told him I would 
not bow to man. I then became frightened and ran like a coward. 
I was arrested and put in jail for four years. I saw myself come out 
of jail. My clothes were threadbare. I was thinner than I am now, if such 
a thing can be possible ; but I was free. In four years from that time 
our creditors stripped us to the skin", and that dream came true. I do 
not want any more dreams of that kind. 

I am in sympathy with the people. I know we have all been 
foolish. I am foolish. I don't think there is a bigger fool than an 
old fool. A man who has had experience ought to know better. One 
of my brethren said to me — and he is a man so kind and gentle that 
I had every reason to believe he would extend to me a little sympathy — 
I told him of one of my last speculations and he said : "If you are as 
big a sucker as that you ought to take your medicine." I said : "I 
am taking it, and it is not sugar-coated either." (Laughter) 

I met a banker a few weeks ago — we were very friendly. Thank 
the Lord, I do not owe that bank anything, but I owe another bank. 
(Laughter) I said: "How are things going?" 

"Well, we are taking everything but their suspenders." 

I thought afterwards that I should have said to him: If that bank 
hasn't got any more elasticity than my suspenders, I will throw them 
in. (Laughter) 

My brethren and sisters, in a few words I desire to say to you 
that I think the things of the world are better advertised than the 
things of God. When I hear those beautiful voices over the radio, 
advertising the things of the world, I am wonderstruck. If there is 
anything under heaven they do not advertise, and give it away at a 
dollar a week, I do not know what it is. By the time they get through 
with us — the "Lucky Strike" puts over their wonderful music— no 
wonder smokers' mouths watet after hearing it. Men, boys, and girls 
who form the habit and have the appetite, I do not believe it is in our 



58 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



power to sympathize with them, as foolish as it is to form a habit of 
that kind and then try to overcome it of themselves. They can not 
do it. God has to help them. They have to go to the Lord. We are 
up against those things. I don't feel like it is right when a man is in 
hell, to stand over him and say: "Well, son, you are in hell. Get out 
as best you can. Sweat it out ; swim or drown." It does not sound 
Christ-like to me. 

I pray God to soften the hearts of the people. They are doing- 
wonderful things and they are going to do wonderful things. We 
have the organization. We have the inspiration. We have the knowl- 
edge. We know how to take care of people, if the Lord will soften 
our hearts and help us to give and keep giving. I pray the Lord, while 
the people are giving, that he will soften the hearts of bankers. As 
long as you can pay your interest and pay your taxes you are safe, 
but I want to tell you if you don't pay it they will foreclose to protect 
the bank and its depositors. As I was once told : "Business is busi- 
ness, believe it or not." I am thankful to the bottom of my heart. 
At my age, I would be as helpless and dependent as a child if it wasn't 
for the Church and its protecting care over me. 

God bless the Church. God bless his servants and help them to 
see and understand, and above all, help us, O God, to understand 
people, that we may be patient, that We may be long-suffering, that 
we may be gentle, that we may not listen to things that are told us, 
until they are proven to be true. God bless you. Amen. 

The congregation then arose and sang the first two verses of the 
hymn, "Redeemer of Israel." 

ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 

Of the First Council of Seventy and President of the Temple Block 

Mission 

The lovely lessons that have been given to us at this session of our 
conference will find lodgment in our hearts. Elder Talmage's thought 
that we should cultivate a deeper reverence for God will find in us a 
ready response; and Elder Welling's message that adversity should in- 
spire us with greater faith in divine providence is a fine truth. Elder 
Kimball says that we should seek the Spirit of God as we travel the road 
of life, that we may be able to meet the battles and to overcome weak- 
nesses. What would we do, if we did not have the Lord to help us? 

Not long ago we had the pleasure of entertaining a Chinese priest 
of the religion of Buddha. He came to Salt Lake City with a letter 
of introduction from a noted scholar of the University of Tokyo, who 
had also visited our city. After a very delightful time at our home, I 
brought the distinguished guest to these grounds to see the buildings and 
to hear the great organ. As we stood before the west door of this 
old building, he asked if it were a place for worship. I replied that it 
is, and with that, he removed his hat and asked that his companion 
remove his. Said he in Chinese : "We are entering a holy temple of 



ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 



59 



the God of the Christians." We entered the building, and I made no 
explanation of its history and use, but with my guests, kept silence, for 
I could see that the Chinese visitor and his companion wished to' say 
nothing. Something of the spirit of beauty and prayer came over us all, 
and I felt that we were worshiping. 

I feel that we do not reverence our sacred buildings enough ; that 
in our meetings there is often too much noise and confusion. To this 
tabernacle and to all our tabernacles, we come to hear the word of God, 
for every building we erect and dedicate to God, is a building for holy 
worship. The old tabernacle of the ancient Jews had an altar which 
was sacred. From these emanated the Spirit and word of God. So 
from this altar goes forth the word of God to all who will listen. It is 
a^ house of prayer and every meeting house built by the Latter-day 
Saints is a house of prayer. 

In attending our Sunday evening sacrament meetings I sometimes 
wonder if we really carry with us from our homes the desire to lift 
our thoughts to God during an hour of service. A part of the service 
is the administering of the sacrament or the Lord's Supper. There we 
enter into a covenant with our Father in heaven. In our act of par- 
taking of the sacrament is there the spirit of reverence and worship? 
And during the entire meeting, are our thoughts given in thanksgiving 
and praise for the blessings we have from God who loves us all? This 
is an important question for you and me to answer. 

I recently read a book entitled "The Story of St. Michele." At the 
close of one of the chapters are these words: "What we keep, we 
lose ; what we give away, we ,keep forever." These words express a 
divine truth, for as we give to God in thought and deed, the gift comes 
back to us ten-fold, yea, one hundred fold. So it is in all life. 

We should cultivate reverence for the things of God, and remember 
that every human being is a child of God and is, therefore, naturally 
a divine spirit. We should speak to our fellow men with reverent 
thought and expression ; we should carry into the houses of the Lord 
a reverence which comes from the true spirit of worship. A beautiful 
lesson of reverence is conveyed in the teachings of Jesus as found in 
twenty-fourth chapter of St. Luke. I -will read it: 

"And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he 
talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures ? 

"And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found 
the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them, _ 

"Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon. 

"And they were told what things were done in the way, and how he was 
known of them in breaking of bread. 

"And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and 
saith unto them, Peace be unto you. 

"But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed they had seen a 
spirit. 

"And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise 
in your hearts ? 

"Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself : handle me, and see ; for 
a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have. 

"And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his feet. 



60 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



"And while the yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, 
Have ye here any meat? 

"And they gave him a piece of broiled fish, and of an honeycomb. 
"And he took it, and did eat before them. 

"And he said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto you, while 
I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the 
law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me. 

"Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the 
scriptures. 

"And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, 
and to rise from the dead the third day : 

"And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name 
among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. 

"And ye are witnesses of these things. 

"And, behold, I send the promise of my .Father upon you : but tarry ye in 
the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high. 

"And he Jed them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and 
blessed them. 

"And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and 
carried up into heaven. 

"And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy: 
"And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God." 

These words express the eternal truth that Christ our Lord has 
risen, and has sent you and me forth to proclaim the fact unto the 
world. He has endowed you and me with power from on high, and 
the expression of this will of God, this power of God, comes in holy 
reverence for God's name and house ; for God's home and children. 
May we grow in this spirit and remember the words of Paul to Tim- 
othy : . 

"Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, 
which is in /thee by the, putting on of my hands. 

"For God hath not given us the spirit of fear ; but of power, and of love, 
and of a sound mind." 

May we be blessed to this end and go forth with that joy and hap- 
piness that comes from within when we reverence and bless his holy 
name, Amen. 

ELDER CLARENCE H. TINGEY 

Recently returned from presiding over the Australian Mission 

My brethren and sisters, I am almost overwhelmed in my attempt 
to respond to this call, and yet one could scarcely feel insecure and 
uncomfortable, surrounded by such a vast concourse of friends. 

As President Grant announced, Sister Tingey and I have just 
returned from the Australian mission. Those of you who have had 
missionary experience know that all of our audiences in the mission 
fields are not friendly nor sympathetic. I have enjoyed immensely my 
labors in the Australian mission, and delight now in representing the 
good people of that land in this conference session. 

iWe have some very splendid Saints throughout Australia, and they 
are working zealously and faithfully in the performance of their labors. 
I think in all of my association I have not met better men and better 



ELDER CLARENCE H. TIN GEY . 



61 



women than some of those who are holding positions of responsibility 
in the Church in that mission. 

I have enjoyed also, far beyond my power to express, the com- 
panionship I have had with the young men who have been sent to us 
as missionaries — beautiful specimens of manhood, deeply endowed with 
the spirit of their callings. They are accomplishing a wonderful work 
in proclaiming the message of peace in that land. 

Australia is a large country. Many people, when reference is 
made to it, look upon it as merely one of the islands of the sea; but 
quite contrary to that, it is a great continent. I was interested in 
President Sloan's reference yesterday, comparing the size of Alaska 
with that of the United States, wherein he stated that were Alaska 
placed over the United States, it would cover all of that portion west 
of Washington. If Australia were placed over the United States 
you would not be able to see the United States. We have one branch 
in our mission which is twenty-seven hundred and fifty miles from 
our mission headquarters. We have another branch one thousand 
miles north of our mission headquarters; and still another one thou- 
sand miles south. 

To keep a group of men laboring in unison, and to keep a body of 
Saints in harmony, extending over a vast country of that sort, requires 
considerable help on the part of the Lord, and I am grateful to ac- 
knowledge here before you that we have had that help, and the work 
in that land is growing and progressing rapidly. 

Unfortunately, Australia has experienced conditions which are not 
pleasant, financially and industrially, far greater than we are seeing 
here ; and I hope we never see the conditions in the United States that 
we now have in that land. But the astonishing thing about it all, to me, 
is that while some of our people have been affected by it, they have 
stood unquestionably above the vast majority of the people of that land. 
Our tithes have fallen somewhat, but not in keeping with the exact 
reduction in the actual wage earnings of the people. There has been a 
definite reduction of more than fifteen per cent in the wages of the 
people. The tithing of our Saints has not fallen that much. I think 
it is a fulfilment of the promise given of the Lord that he would preserve 
his people, and I know that he is doing it in that land. 

I hope and pray that the conditions which are now facing us will 
not be too severe to bear, even as has been stated by former speakers in 
this conference. I am reminded of an old German proverb which 
says : "The hard is the good." We are facing hard times, but they 
are good times, my brethren and sisters — good times because they are 
making us think more soberly, more sincerely, more deeply, into the 
things of life. 

I was reading an article in the Literary Digest just yesterday in 
which this very thought is given, and it is declared that the people 
of the United States are making a greater demand for better literature, 
better types of entertainment, better ways of spending their means ; 
and all of this, I think, speaks for progress and development. 



62 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



I believe frankly that this Church, with two or three years of 
meager privation, will become stronger as a body, and its people will 
become more faithful ; their testimonies will increase more abundantly. 
We need this, I think, definitely. 

I want to bear witness before you, my brethren and sisters, that 
my stay in the mission field was the most enjoyable time of my life; 
that I return to you now with a more convincing knowledge that God 
lives than I have ever had before in my life. I want to bear testimony 
also, and I have reason to bear this witness because of a manifestation 
which was given me in the mission field, that our leader, President 
I leber J. Grant, is in very deed the one who is divinely and rightly 
selected to lead this people. I know it, and I can say no differently 
and be honorable before my God. I thank him for his leadership, and 
I hope and pray that the Lord will so sustain me that I will never 
turn a hand other than to give him aid and assistance. 

God bless you, my brethren and sisters, and this Church, and 
particularly its leaders, with inspiration and revelation, that we may 
grow to be all that the Lord expected that we should be, I ask, in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER RULON S. WELLS 

Of the First Council of Seventy 

"We believe the Bible to be the word of God, as far as it is translated 
correctly. We also believe the Book of Mormon to be the word of God." 

I think I may safely add that we also believe the book of Doctrine 
and Covenants and the Pearl of Great Price to be the word of God. 
The scriptures have been given to us by our Heavenly Father for our 
guidance, for our instruction. The great work of the Lord is one 
of educating his children, and these are the text books from which 
we are to learn the ways of the Lord. 

I think we may also say that salvation is rather synonymous to 
the term education, for we read in our scriptures, in the inspired 
words of the prophets, that we can gain salvation no faster than 
we obtain knowledge. It should be our purpose, then, to grow in the 
knowledge of God and in good works, day by day. 

The Bible and these other scriptures are the words of eternal 
life, concerning which it has been said that "Heaven and earth may 
pass away, but my word shall not pass away." All shall be fulfilled. 
For this purpose they are given unto us. A great many people, in 
investigating the scriptures and searching in them, do it rather for 
the purpose of wresting them, and putting upon them private inter- 
pretations, or endeavoring to disprove them. It ought to be remembered 
that the Bible and the books of the inspired word are not given to us 
for the purpose of teaching us astronomy, geology, chronology, or any 
of these particular sciences. But they do have a specific purpose of 
educating us in the things of God. Education is important to all 
mankind. No man can be saved in his ignorance. How grateful we 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS 



63 



ought to be for that army of men and women who are engaged in our 
public school systems, our teachers, the teachers of our children, for 
our professors, for our scientists, for our inventors and discoverers; 
for these too are servants of God, engaged in the great task of 
educating mankind. 

If we are, however, to be educated in the higher branches of edu- 
cation—and by that I mean those particular ones that are of necessity 
excluded from our public schools on account of our differing opinions — 
if we are to be educated in those things particularly that pertain to 
the things of God, we need a particular kind of teachers. For this 
purpose we need apostles and prophets. We need inspired teachers — 
men who speak as they are moved by the Holy Ghost, for "no man 
knoweth the things of God but the Spirit of God." As well might a 
man try to teach chemistry or algebra without knowing them as to 
undertake the teaching of the things of God without the Spirit of God. 
It cannot be done in either case. 

The Apostle Peter tells us something of the importance of this 
truth. Says he : 

"We have also a more sure word of prophecy ; whereunto ye do well that 
ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, 
and the day star arise in your hearts ; 

"Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private 
interpretation. 

"For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man : but holy men of 
God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost." 

That is what we believe, and that which they spoke under that 
divine power and influence is the word of God. Such should be our 
teaching and such should be our teachers in these higher .branches of 
education. 

Education, then, is the purpose of the Almighty, and we are here 
in God's great school. Our education did not begin when we entered the 
school rooms, neither does it end when we emerge from these institu- 
tions of learning. And as we come forth from them we very appropri- 
ately celebrate the affair by commencement exercises, for it is another 
commencement for which we have been preparing ourselves. 

When I speak of education I mean that all-round education which 
contemplates the full development of all our faculties — physical, mental 
and spiritual — that we may indeed become like God. It is for this 
purpose he has sent us here. We are in attendance at God's Great 
School — a school of experience in bodies of flesh and bones — the earth 
life school with all of its potentialities for development and growth. 
And when we emerge from this great school and are called hence, let 
us hope th^t we will have so far advanced in our education and train- 
ing that we may receive our diplomas, and then, that suitable com- 
mencement exercises may also be given ; for this is indeed still another 
commencement as we enter into that still higher institution of learning. 
God's Great University, wherein we may co'ntinue to learn until we shall 
attain to that perfection which is contemplated in the words of the 



64 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Savior: "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in 
heaven is perfect." 

Is this secular education which we receive in our public schools 
an essential part of our education? Most assuredly. If we have 
any rational idea of God we must conceive that he is a great scholar, 
a scientist, an inventor, a discoverer, with full knowledge of the forces 
of the universe, a chemist, a mathematician. He who framed the 
universe is surely educated along all these lines. 

Fortunately for us we have been formed and fashioned in his 
image, not only in his physical image' but also in his divine attributes ; 
and these attributes may be developed to their God-like proportions. 
But they may also be distorted and perverted until they become vices. 
The attributes that we have inherited are all good — there are no bad 
ones, but we may pervert, distort and counterfeit them until they 
appear as vices. The thing then to do is to cultivate the genuine 
and reject the counterfeits, for these are the devil's counterfeits and 
he has counterfeited every one of them. Let me illustrate for a few 
moments. 

Economy is a divine attribute. In the economy of God 
there is no waste. A God-like attribute, but men have distorted it 
until it does not resemble the divine attribute at all. And what is that 
distorted form, that devil's counterfeit? It is stinginess. God isn't 
stingy but he is economical. There are some people who think they 
are economists when in fact they are only stingy — too stingy to educate 
their children and send them to places of learning, places, particularly, 
where they can be taught the things of God. They are too stingy 
sometimes to send their sons and daughters out into the mission field, 
sometimes too stingy to properly clothe them and give them the proper 
nourishment, too stingy to pay their tithes and their offerings. That is 
not economy. Don't be stingy but be economical. 

Another thing is acquisitiveness, that quality whereby we are 
enabled to acquire property and surround ourselves with the comforts 
of life. What a splendid thing it is! Think of what the Lord has 
acquired! "The earth is the Lord's and the fulness thereof." But 
this too may be perverted, and it becomes, under the power of dia- 
bolical influences, one of the greatest vices. And what is that? It 
is greed, it is avarice, that soul-cankering vice ; it is the love of money, 
that thing which lies at the very root of all evil, for which men will lie, 
will cheat, will misrepresent, will steal, will kill. Read the newspapers, 
and you will find abundant proof of this. It is the leading cause of 
strife, of bloodshed and all the horrors of war. Surely "the love of 
money is indeed the root of all evil." And yet, after all it is only a 
perversion, distortion or a counterfeit of the divine attribute — acquisi- 
tiveness, more, commonlv called frugality or thrift. 

Again, tear is a divine attribute. What, fear a divine attribute? 
Yes, indeed! Even God would fear to do evil. Burnt children very 
properly ^ fear the fire. "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of 
wisdom." Fear is that wholesome attribute which inspires the prayer, 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS

"Deliver us from all evil." But the devil has his counterfeit. And 
what is it ? It is cowardice. Don't be a coward. Be not afraid of the 
face of man but fear God and keep his commandments. 

This, however, is not the greatest of attributes. The greatest 
attribute of all is love. Love is the biggest thing in the world. It is 
a panacea for every ill, a cure for every malady. And love casteth 
out fear. Conceive if you can, the great love of God. "God so loved 
the world that he gave his Only Begotten Son that whosoever believeth 
in him should not perish but have everlasting life." Think of that 
pure love of Christ. "Greater love hath no man than this, that a man 
lay down his. life for his friends." The nearest approach that we see 
to this divine love is, I think, the unselfish love of a mother for her 
children. The more exalted and glorious the attribute is, the more 
contemptible and vicious is its counterfeit. Lust is the devil's counter- 
feit, the very embodiment of everything that is vile. "And now 
abideth faith, hope and charity, these three, but the greatest of these is 
charity." Charity which is the pure love of Christ. 

Let us now consider Faith. A sectarian minister — I don't think 
he was orthodox — once said to me: "Mr. Wells, I don't like that 
doctrine of yours that you call faith. Just think, to believe everything 
you hear. It is a positive weakness — a vice." Very true, so it is; 
but this is not faith; it's the devil's counterfeit — credulity. Where 
would this not lead us if we were to believe everything we hear? What 
does faith require ? What shall we believe ? The answer is : "Believe 
on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved." Believe in his 
Gospel which has within it the power of God unto salvation. Believe 
the truth. His Gospel is the truth. Don't believe liars or deceivers. Faith 
is that inherent divine attribute which is cultivated by doing his will 
and which enables us to discern the truth. The Savior tells us that 
his sheep hear his voice and follow after him but a stranger they 
will not follow. Then what is faith? The Apostle Paul tells us in 
his epistle to the Hebrews: "Now faith is the substance (or assurance) 
of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen." What are the 
things we are hoping for ? Are we hoping for the sordid things of this 
world? .For the gratification of evil desires? Then do we hope in 
vain. But if our hope is that inspired by the teachings of our Lord, 
the hope of life beyond the grave, of a reunion with loved ones that 
have gone before, a life of joy and happiness in the realms above, 
eternal life in the presence of God, then are our hopes founded upon 
the truth. Faith then is the assurance that God gives us that our 
exalted hopes shall be realized. It is one of those divine attributes 
which we have inherited with all the others from our divine parents. 
It is a part of his image in which we were created and should therefore 
be cultivated but its counterfeit should be rejected. 

Many illustrations of the divine or genuine attributes which under 
evil influences are counterfeited and distorted into vices might be 
elaborated but I will merely cite a few for your reflection :

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Pride becomes vanity. 
Self esteem becomes egotism. 
Praise becomes flattery. 
Courage becomes foolhardiness. 

All good things are counterfeited. Our government issues currency 
as a legal tender, in various denominations— one, two, five, ten, twenty, 
fifty and hundred dollar bills and of still larger denomination — but some 
devil will make counterfeits and endeavor, sometimes successfully, to 
palm them off as genuine. The government also issues coins of gold 
and silver from its mints but some devil will take a baser metal and 
gild it over with gold and likewise palm it off for genuine. 

Some people say they are not religious ; they are riot religiously 
inclined. They don't mean what they say, they are thinking of the 
devil's counterfeit. Don't despise the pure gold of religion because 
the devil makes a counterfeit of it in hypocrisy. Be religious but 
don't be a hypocrite. Our higher education consists then in developing 
the genuine, the divine attributes and casting out the false, the counter- 
feits. To do the former is an exercise in faith, the latter is one in 
repentance. That we might obtain this education our first parents 
partook of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. We 
are still partaking of that forbidden fruit notwithstanding the dire 
consequences of earth life, its trials, its tribulations, its sorrow, its 
suffering and finally death. "For in the day that thou eatest thereof 
thou shalt surely die." But also with the full assurance of an un- 
conditional redemption from that fall and an exaltation predicated 
upon our diligence in this preparatory school .during the period of our 
mortal existence. Blessed are we then if we have accepted the good 
and rejected the evil, or, in other words, developed the genuine and 
cast out the counterfeits. God help us to do so. Amen.

The Lord made this wonderful promise to Isaiah : 

"So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth : it, shall not 
return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall 
prosper in the thing whereto I sent it." (Isa. 55:11.) 

This foreshadows the wonderful missionary work that is being 
done by every agency in the Church. Truly the Gospel is the leaven 
that is "leavening the whole lump." There is room and a congenial 
atmosphere in this Church for spiritually-minded people, men and 
women with most lofty spiritual ideals ; and the intellectually great 
may drink from the- fountain of truth until their souls are filled with 
knowledge, satisfying and soul-saving. 

Recently there appeared an editorial in the New York Times in 
which the brilliant and scholarly editor gave an eloquent summary of 
the remarkable achievements of science during the year 1930, and he 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS

closed with these words : "The science that not only has such practical 
application, but that has faith in a continuing creation and that co- 
operates with 'a. Creator continually on the job.' " 

Is this an echo of that glorious truth the Lord revealed unto 
Nephi, of old : "For my work is not yet finished ; neither shall it be 
until the end of man, neither from that time henceforth and forever " 
(2 Nephi 29:9.) And again : "For behold, this is my work and my 
glory — to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man." 
(Pearl of Great Price, p. 4.) 

"The works of God continue, 
And worlds and lives abound ; 
Improvement and progression 
Have one eternal round." 

A noted preacher, a few weeks ago was asked this question: 
"[What has science done to help religion?" He replied: "For example, 
millions of us .were taught to believe in God because he made the 
universe out of nothing in a single week. Now we are confronted 
by a large array of facts showing that this particular theory of creation 
is untenable." 

Nearly a hundred years ago the Prophet Joseph Smith declared, 
by the inspiration of God, that the world was made of materials that 
have existed eternally: In the Book of Abraham it is recorded that 
the Creator said : "We will go down, for there is space there, and we 
will take of these materials, and we will make an earth whereon these 
may dwell." (Pearl of Great Price, p. 37.) 

How marvelous is the truth that the Prophet Joseph announced to 
the world ! 

"Praise to the man who communed with Jehovah ! 
Jesus anointed that prophet and seer — 
Blessed to open the last dispensation; 
Kings shall extol him, and nations revere." 

A sailing vessel, long from port, so the story goes, when off the 
coast of South America, ran short of water, and the men were in sore 
straits. Suddenly a sail appeared on the horizon, and when the stranger 
drew near this message was signaled to her : "Water, we want water !" 
She answered by saying, "Cast down your bucket where you are]" 
Again the appeal was made, "Water, we want water!" And again 
the answer came, "Cast down your bucket where you are!" Once more 
the signal fluttered from the mast, "Water, we want water!" And for 
the third time the answer was waved back, "Cast down your bucket 
where you are!" This the incredulous captain finally did and it was 
drawn up filled with fresh water from the Amazon river, over the 
mouth of which they were then sailing. 

In this Church there is a stream of living water that flows from 
the throne of God. Why go to the ends of the earth in search for the 
truth when it is here for you to partake of? Why seek for faith-

destroying mystery? Oh, won't you drink of this living stream? For 
if you will your souls shall never thirst again. 

I testify to the glorious truth of this heavenly Gospel. The success- 
ful work those fine missionaries are doing is the best evidence that 
God is with them continually. 

I bear you my testimony too that the leaders of this Church are 
men of God, raised up and consecrated by him for the marvelous work 
they are divinely commissioned to do. If we are great enough to be 
humble and diligent we will live to see this grand and inspiring work 
prosper more than it has ever done, and out of these hard times there 
will come a magnificent revival of spirituality, in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

Singing by the congregation, "Zion stands with hills surrounded." 
The closing prayer was offered by Elder Walter L. Adamson, 
President of the Blaine Stake. 

The Conference adjourned until 2 :00 p. m. 

SECOND DAY 
AFTERNOON MEETING 

Promptly at 2 :00 p. m. President Heber J. Grant, who presided, 
called the fourth meeting of the Conference to order and announced 
the opening hymn "Prayer is the soul's sincere desire." 

After the singing of this hymn by the congregation, the opening 
prayer was offered by Elder Robert I. Burton, President of the Mount 
Ogden Stake. 

The congregation then sang the hymn "Come, come, ye Saints." 

ELDER CHARLES H. HART 

Of the First Council of Seventy 

I am very grateful, my brethren and sisters, to have this privilege 
of meeting with you at this conference and of mingling my voice and 
testimony with that of the brethren in support of this great latter-day 
cause. 

I miss my associate who usually sits at my right at these meetings, 
President Joseph W. McMurrin. I remember that at the last conference 
he read, in full, the first section of the Doctrine and Covenants, a beauti- 
ful iand inspirational revelation outlining this great latter-day work. I 
know of .no finer preface to be found in all literature than the preface 
to the Doctrine and Covenants. 

I have rejoiced in this conference from the opening keynote speech 
by President Grant until the present time, including also the splendid 
testimonies by the mission presidents given in the inspirational way they 
have spoken in this conference. 

An editorial from a secular paper, The Toronto, Ontario, Globe, 



ELDER CHARLES H. HART 



69 



appeared a short time ago mentioning two books which I would like 
to mention here. I inquired of the librarian upon my arrival home 
but found neither of these books in our libraries. The librarian has 
kindly sent for and purchased each one of these books and I have really 
had a feast in reading such as I have been able to read of these two 
volumes. One of the books so mentioned is by Mr. Linton, who 
marshals the facts on the subject of belief in the Bible, and is entitled, 
"A Lawyer and the Bible," by I. H. Linton, published in 1929. It 
does not equal, I think, "Nelson on the Cause and Cure of Infidelity," 
which President Grant is very familiar with, and parts of which he 
has presented to the Latter-day Saints on several occasions. At least 
this book is a small replica of "Nelson on Infidelity," a book which I 
trust that each one of us will read who has not yet done so. This 
book of Linton is also well worth reading. 

The "Globe," published in Toronto, which has the custom of 
publishing each week a religious editorial, says this of Mr. Linton's book : 

"Here is a statement of remarkable significance from a lawyer. Mr. Linton 
marshals facts showing that when unbelieving lawyers who really supposed there 
was nothing to the claims of Christianity of the Bible, have honestly examined 
the evidence, they have come out uncompromisingly on the side of the old 
faith and have gladly admitted that they were completely convinced by the facts. 
The most charitable, and the most reasonable thing one can infer from Mr. 
Darrow's declared atheism — " 

In mentioning Mr. Darrow's name I feel the same charity in 
judging him as was expressed here by Brother Stephen L, Richards, 
and I mention his name only for the purpose of presenting some 
other matters that I have checked upon and think worthy of presenting 
here. 

The most reasonable thing one can infer from Mr. Darrow's declared atheism 
"is that he has never examined the evidence. For lawyers admittedly much 
greater than he have been convinced by a logical, dispassionate study of the 
facts in the case. 

"Simon Greenleaf was one of these. He was the greatest master of the 
legal subject of Evidence that modern times have known. The London Law 
Magazine said of him : 'Upon the existing law of Evidence (by Greenleaf) more 
light has been shown from the New World than from all the lawyers who adorn 
the courts of Europe.' His words, says Linton, 'are always listened to with 
respect in any court, even though it be the English House o'f Lords or the 
Supreme Court of the United States — the two most august judicial bodies in 
the world.' 

"Greenleaf applied his massive intellect to the study of the Gospels, and 
fortunately his work has been preserved for this generation in his book, 
'Testimony of the Evangelists.' It is a classic work in the realm of logic and 
faith. By a study that makes the reasoning of most men seem childish and 
ignorant in comparison, Greenleaf patiently examines the available evidence, 
subjects it to unsparing scrutiny, and vindicates in triumph the utter reliability 
and unswerving accuracy of the Writers of the four Gospels. This great master 
of evidence expresses his conviction and conclusion that 'every honest and 
impartial man' will accept the testimony of the evangelists as unimpeachable 
in a court of justice. And that means, in simple honesty and inescapable logic, 
that Christ is the Son of God and the only Savior of men ; that he died for our 
sins and rose again; and that all who believe in him are given eternal life."

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



The book of Greenleaf's entitled "The Testimony of the Evan- 
gelists" — Matthew, Mark, Luke and John — was a new book to me. I 
was surprised that I, could not find it in either of the law libraries in this 
city, and upon application the general library sent for it and bought 
it and I have since had the pleasure of purchasing a copy for myself. 
It is the most valuable law book that I have ever owned or read. 1 
have not read it all yet because a great part of it, some four hundred 
pages, is taken up with a very thorough synopsis of the harmony of the 
Gospels. The closing testimony of Dr. Simon Greenleaf is a wonderful 
eulogy to Christianity. 

I cannot understand in thinking about it how it could happen 
that such a valuable book on the Evangelists should have escaped my 
attention for so many years. It has really been a very great treat to 
me to read the work that he has so well done for the Christian religion 
in just presenting the testimony of the Evangelists together in a way 
that makes so strong a case. 

The work is dedicated to the members of the legal profession in 
such striking language. He says : 

"The things related by the Evangelists are certainly of the most momentous 
character, affecting the principles of our conduct here, and our happiness forever. 
* * * These are no ordinary claims and it seems hardly possible for a rational 
being to regard them with even ,a subdued interest, much less to treat them 
with mere indifference and contempt." 

I am going to read the closing testimony which Dr. Greenleaf gives 
to Christianity : 

"Lastly, the great character they have portrayed is perfect — " meaning of 
course the Savior and speaking of the evangelists — "It is the character of a 
sinless being; of one supremely wise and supremely good. It exhibits no error, 
no sinister intention^ no imprudence, no ignorance, no evil passion, no impatience ; 
in a word, no fault ; but all is perfect uprightness ; innocence, wisdom, goodness 
and truth. The mind of man has never conceived the idea of such a character, 
even for his gods ; nor has history or poetry shadowed it forth. The doctrines 
and precepts of Jesus are in strict accordance with the attributes of God, 
agreeable to the most exalted idea which we can form of them, either from 
reason of from revelation. They are strikingly adapted to the capacity of 
mankind, and yet are delivered with a simplicity and majesty wholly divine. 
He spake as man never spake. He spake with authority; yet addressed himself 
to the reason and the understanding of men; and he spake with wisdom, for 
men could neither gainsay nor resist. In his private life he exhibits a character 
not - merely of strict justice, but of overflowing benignity. He is temperate, 
without austerity ; his meekness and humility are signal ; his patience is in- 
vincible ; truth and sincerity illustrate his whole conduct ; every one of his 
virtues is regulated by consummate prudence ; and he both wins the love of his 
friends, and extorts the wonder and admiration of his enemies. He is repre- 
sented in every variety of situation in life, from the height of worldly grandeur, 
amid the acclamations of an admiring multitude, to the deepest abyss of human 
degradation and woe, apparently deserted of God and man. Yet everywhere he 
is the same ; displaying a character of unearthly perf ectionj symmetrical in all 
its proportions, and encircled with splendor more than human. Either the men 
of Galilee were men of superlative wisdom and extensive knowledge and ex- 
perience, and of deeper skill in the arts of deception than any and all others, before 
or after them, or they have truly stated the astonishing things which they saw 
and heard. 



ELDER CHARLES H. HART

The narratives of the evangelists are now submitted to the reader's perusal 
and examination, upon the principle and by the rules already stated For this 
purpose, and for the sake of more ready and close comparison they arc 
arranged in juxtapositon, after the general order of the latest and most approved 
harmonies. 

How this remarkable book could have existed so long and the 
legal profession not be in possession of it and not to be found in the 
law libraries here I cannot understand. 

"The question is not upon the strict propriety of the arrangement, but the 
veracity of the witnesses and the credibility of their narratives. With tbe 
relative merits of modern harmonists, and with points of controversy among 
theologians, the writer has no concern. His business is that of a lawyer, 
examining the testimony of witnesses by tbe rules of his profession, in order 
to ascertain whether, if they had thus testified on oath, in a court of justice, 
they would be entitled to credit; and whether their narratives as we now have 
them, would be received as ancient documents coming from tbe proper custody. 
If so, then it is believed that every honest and impartial man will act con- 
sistently with that result by receiving their testimony in all tbe extent of its 
import. To write out a full commentary or argument upon tbe text, would be 
a useless addition to the bulk of the volume; but a few notes have been added 
for illustration of the narratives, and for the clearing up of apparent discrepancies, 
as being all that members of the legal profession would desire." 

I have been instructed and thrilled with the work the author has 
done. It indicates much patience and interest on the part of this 
great jurist in placing and elucidating the testimony of the Evangelists 
and giving explanatory notes of some supposed contradictions which 
are not really such when they are carefully examined and considered 
in the light of rules of civil evidence as pointed out by a master mind 
and eminent authority such as Mr. Simon Greenleaf possesses. 

There is much in reference to the rules of evidence that has been 
presented from time to time, and in fact at our Centennial Conference 
some of those rules to weigh and measure evidence were presented and 
it would be useless or unnecessary to repeat them further now. 

I appreciate the kindness of my brethren, President Grant and 
the brethren who surround him, and the kindness of my friends and 
my people, and I am glad that I am regaining my strength and that I 
am able to appear before you and talk to you on this occasion. 

My testimony corroborates the testimony given by Dr. Greenleaf 
in this wonderful work of his, a powerful one from a legal standpoint. 
I give my testimony after an experience in this Church of more than 
a quarter of a century, and after working with these my brethren, and 
I bear this confirmation of the testimony just read, in the name of 
Jesns Christ. Amen. 

ELDER ANTOINE R. IVINS 

Of the First Council of Seventy and President of the Mex ican Mission 

My beloved brethren and sisters, I believe that this is the greatest 
occasion of my life. In all my experience I have never had the privilege 
of addressing such a vast and intelligent audience as this should be. It 



72 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



is only the realization of the fact that you are all friends and brethren 
that makes it possible for me to stand here at this time and mingle 
my testimony with the testimonies that have already been borne. 

In standing here I bring to you the greetings of people of a 
different race and a different hue from those into whose faces I am 
looking at this time. I bring you the greetings of about thirteen thou- 
sand people of the Pacific Isles. Every one of them would like to be 
here and greet you personally, to sit and listen to the words of exhorta- 
tion that are given from this stand. This, on my part, is an unofficial 
greeting, but it is sincere nevertheless, for I know that those people 
with whom I have been laboring for the past ten years, each and 
every one, have the welfare of this work at heart. 

I bring you also the greetings of not quite so many, but a kindred 
people who are living nearer to us, the Mexican people. There are 
quite a number of them in the Church, and they are faithful and 
sincere and reasonably energetic in the performance of their duties. 

The work with that people was begun in the year 1875, when my 
father, as a junior companion with a party of half a dozen or more, 
rode his horse from St. George as far as the city of Chihuahua, in the 
State of Chihuahua and the Republic of Mexico, returning by the 
same means of transportation. Since that time various vicissitudes have 
befallen that mission. Men have gone and opened up the mission, 
then returned, and the mission has lapsed, and that has been repeated 
time and again. But every time that mission has been reopened people 
have been found who were willing to listen to the Gospel, people 
who had attempted, through all of the years of silence, to retain their 
faith in the Gospel. From those people I bring you greetings. 

It is going to be a difficult problem, I realize, to shoulder the 
burden that has fallen upon me with the death of President Pratt. 
He was a noble and valiant man. He labored with all the power, 
zeal and energy that God gave him ,to further the work among 
that people. He had their interest at heart, and he won their love 
and their respect. I pray that with the aid of your faith and prayers, 
with the power of God to back me up, I may have humility and faith 
sufficient to carry on the work that he so well and faithfully performed ; 
that the work may not falter, but that it may go forward. 

Now, if this is done it will have to be done through the aid of 
your boys and girls. We have in that mission at the present time 
forty-one of them, all faithful and energetic and lovable, all of them 
that I have met. It has not been my good fortune to meet them all, 
but I hope that within a few short weeks I shall have been through 
that mission and met every boy and girl that is laboring there. 

It seems that the people of the Church are not entirely clear as to 
what the Mexican mission at present consists of. You will remember, 
those of you who have read the papers, that certain laws have recently 
been passed by the Mexican government, which forbid the entry into 
Mexico of priests and ministers of foreign birth ; so that our own 
Elders were forced to leave Mexico under this rule. We have in

Mexico, laboring, as an ordained missionary, only one person at this 
time, and he is a Mexican boy. He is laboring in the vicinity of 
Monterey and is doing a very excellent work. All of the other work 
that is being done by missionaries is being done in the United States. 
Our mission covers a length of two thousand miles, from Los Angeles 
to Brownsville, Texas. In addition to that we have a very "thrifty 
and vigorous branch in this city, and we have organized branches 
that are laboring under the guidance of native branch presidents in 
various cities in and around the valley of Mexico. 

I was very much surprised when I first learned, years ago, of the 
work that was being done among the Mexicans in the United States, 
but when you look into the matter it seems a logical field, for in the 
city of Los Angeles alone there are said to be no less than one hundred 
and fifty thousand Mexicans. We are attempting to make contact with 
those people. We are trying to do it with six persons — -four boys and 
two young ladies. They are accomplishing a wonderful work, but they 
are limited, naturally, by their number, and as much as might be ac- 
complished with more people is not being realized. We have there a 
very fine congregation, however. They are diligent, energetic and 
faithful. 

From there our labor extends, as I have said, clear to Browns- 
ville, and we have some of the finest young men and young ladies in 
the Church working with those people. We hope that you who are 
here and who are bearing the burden of that labor will have the where- 
withal to supply them. Some of those boys right now are wondering 
how long they will be able to stay — iwhen their missions may be ter- 
minated by the lack of funds. I hope that they will be able to stay until 
they qare to return, for it is an unfortunate thing when a missionary 
from that field has to quit his work prematurely. It takes the first 
half of his period to learn the" language, and then if he has to go home 
we miss the great accomplishments that he is capable of during the 
latter part of the missionary period. I trust that you will be able to 
stand the burden, that you will sacrifice willingly in their behalf, for 
every one of them is interested.; every one of them is laboring with 
diligence and energy. Most of them are enjoying good health, and 
you have to worry little over that. However, they are in a warm 
country ; they have differences of food to contend with, and occasionally 
some of them suffer because of that. Right now we have two or 
three boys concerning whom we have to be very careful, because they are 
suffering from the changes of food that they have had to meet. 

I pray that the Lord will bless us, that he will give us power to 
endure, for the power to endure is the genius of this Gospel. If we 
cannot endure, the Lord pity us. These times are trying, but if we 
will round up our shoulders I am sure that the Lord will come to 
our rescue, that we will be able to carry on, and that we will not be 
the losers because of these trying times. The times of thrift and 
prosperity are the ones that we should be afraid of, not the times of 
adversity.

I bear you my testimony that this is the greatest work in the

ELDER JOHN W. HART 

Of the Church Auditing Committee 

This is one time in my life that I was really surprised. I was 
sitting very comfortably in the audience, with some of my friends, 
enjoying the services, as I usually do. However, being called upon 
I feel under obligation to respond. I never did, to my knowledge, 
refuse anything that was required of me by those who presided over me. 
I am very sorry that I missed the services yesterday. I was out in the 
state of Montana, and came directly from there this morning. I am very 
happy to get here for the second day's services. 

I hope and pray that the Lord will sustain me this afternoon 
for the few minutes that I occupy this position. I know that he comes 
to the rescue of those who are called upon to perform service in 
the Church. 

I was interested in the remarks of Brother Ivins this afternoon, 
as it was only last May that I had the privilege of visiting him in the 
Hawaiian Islands, and I was very happy to meet him. I was very 
happy also to note the progress of the work of the Lord in that island. 
While I was there one Sunday I had the privilege of attending the Sab- 
bath school. I never in all my life attended a Sabbath school that was bet- 
ter disciplined and better organized, and that functioned any better than 
this Sunday school in Honolulu. There were practically all nationalities 
present. There were natives, Chinese, Japanese, Americans, and other 
people, but to my surprise, notwithstanding this great mixture there 
was order, and the Spirit of the Lord prevailed. 

I had the privilege of attending their sacrament meeting at night, 
it being Aaronic (Priesthood' night, i I sat there and listened to the 
natives — and it was principally natives that had part on the program — 
stand up and deliver their parts in a most efficient manner, enjoying 
the Spirit of the Lord. Their splendid chorus of about thirty-five 
singers rendered most efficiently the hymn, "An angel from on high." - 
It was wonderful! I was asked to speak a few minutes, which I did. 
and can say that I enjoyed the Spirit of the Lord there as much as 1 
ever enjoyed it anywhere in my life. This all goes to show, my 
brethren and sisters, that wherever we go, wherever we find a con- 
gregation or an organization of the Latter-day Saints, we find that 
same splendid, sweet Spirit of the Lord. 

I am very happy that I am a member of this Church. I have never 
seen the day that I have had to apologize for being a member. I have 



ELDER JOHN W. HART

always told my own family, the people of the Rigby stake over whom 
I have the honor to preside, and others with whom I have come in 
contact, that the great thing for us to learn as Latter-day Saints, par- 
ticularly the young men and the young women, is to find out God, the 
Eternal Father, and his Son Jesus Christ, and to know something 
about this great latter-day work ; that if they would only inform them- 
selves along these lines they would always have joy and satisfaction 
in meeting the public in any land, and discussing with them the 
beauties of this great and glorious plan that has been entrusted to 
our care as Latter-day Saints. 

My brethren and sisters, I am in strict harmony with those who 
preside over this Church. I know that they are men of God. The 
Lord will inspire them as long as they hold these positions, to direct 
the affairs of this people in the manner in which they should be 
directed. I am happy to have their confidence. I rejoice in being- 
able to associate with them, and especially when they come to the Rigby 
stake to have the privilege of entertaining them. They always bring 
with them a splendid spirit, and when they leave we are all better for 
their coming. 

I testify to you, my brethren and sisters, that God the Eternal 
Father lives, that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God, and that these 
men who surround me here are inspired of God, and are the living 
oracles. May God help us to understand and know these things, and 
to maintain them all the time, is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, 
Amen. 

PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAWSON 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

My brethren and sisters, a speaker who stands before a congrega- 
tion of this character very well understands that he is under a great 
burden of responsibility and is expected to speak the truth, and nothing 
but the truth. If he should advance false doctrine it would be imme- 
diately detected by those who preside in the conference, and I think 
likely it would be detected by a congregation of Latter-day Saints. No 
man can long deceive the Latter-day Saints. This, I apprehend, is be- 
cause the Spirit of God rests upon them, and they are able to distinguish 
between truth and error. I have attended many conferences in this 
building, and have never yet heard a false doctrine advanced from this 
pulpit. I take some pleasure in bearing this testimony. 

PAST AND PRESENT LINKED TOGETHER 

I have reflected much upon conditions that exist. I think I am 
safe in saying, my brethren and sisters, that the past and the present 
are connected by a chain of divine historical events, and also of his- 
torical, secular events — a chain that cannot be broken. This might 
be demonstrated by many incidents. Let me refer to one or two. 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



THE GOSPEL. — INDIVISIBLE AND EVERLASTING 

There is the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. The Gospel was 
preached in the beginning, it is preached to the world at the present 
time, it will be declared to future generations. The teachings of the 
Gospel exert a profound influence upon the world. The Gospel is a code 
of principles which are declared to be principles of salvation to those 
who will receive and obey them. The Gospel is complete in itself. Noth- 
ing is to be added to it. Nothing may be subtracted from it. The Gos- 
pel cannot be divided up into sectional parts, and if it were these 
sectional parts could not be safely treated separately. The Gospel must 
be taken as a whole. It is everlasting in its nature. It existed before, 
it exists now, and it will exist hereafter. 

AN INCIDENT FROM THE DISTANT PAST 

Let me draw your attention briefly for a moment to another inci- 
dent, taken from the distant past. Let us go back to the Garden of 
Eden, which is sometimes designated as the beginning. When Adam, 
who is referred to< by divine revelation as the first man, as "the ancient 
of days," as the father of the human family, — when he partook of the 
forbidden fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, mortality and 
death were introduced into the world, which has profoundly influenced 
the children of men from that distant day to the present time and will 
influence the world of men to the very end of time. Thus the past 
is connected with the present and will also have a direct bearing upon 
the future. 

A DREADFUL DAY 

Perhaps I may be pardoned if I particularize just a little further. 
One hears a voice coming out of the past. It is the voice of a humble 
servant of God, a prophet, and the words that issued from his mouth 
were also recorded in sacred writ and took the form of a prophecy which, 
if it shall be fulfilled, will influence the world of men very greatly. The 
prophet said: "A day is coming, a dreadful day will come upon the 
world." I fancy I hear some one say : "A dreadful day, Brother 
Clawson? We have had many dreadful days." Yes, we have had many 
dreadful days, when news came of earthquakes, destruction by fire and 
smoke, and waves of the ocean heaving themselves beyond their bounds, 
also cyclones and hurricanes sweeping over the earth. Yes, brother, 
these were dreadful days, but this particular day referred to by the 
prophet is somewhat different. It presents rather a different view. This 
day is called the "great and dreadful day of the Lord,") — quite different 
from these other days. And then we are told in a prophecy that before 
the great and dreadful day of the Lord shall come there must occur 
a very important circumstance, and it surely must precede the dreadful 
day of the Lord. Let us read the words of the prophecy, which is found 
in Malachi, the fourth chapter : 

"For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven ; and iall the proud, 
yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble ; and the day that cometh shall burn 
them up, saith the Lord of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch." 



PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAW SON 



77 



DESTRUCTION OF WICKED 

That is a dreadful day, and yet in connection with it, and some- 
what related to it, is shown forth the mercy of God, for the record says : 

•'But unto you 'that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with 
healing in his wings ; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the stall. 

"And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under tthe 
soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this, saith the Lord )of hosts." 

It would seem from this that the wicked are to be destroyed ab- 
solutely, root and branch, because of their wickedness, of which they 
will not repent, and hence a just judgment comes upon them. 

"Remember ye the law of Moses, my servant, which I commanded unto him 
in Horeb for Sail Israel, with the statutes and judgments." 

MARVELOUS MANIFESTATIONS 

•Now comes a very singular and wonderful part of this great proph- 
ecy that was uttered in the long distant past : 

"Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great 
and dreadful day of the Lord: 

"And he shall turn. ( the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart 
of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse." 

. That is the. prophecy, brethren and sisters, and I doubt not that 
it is greatly misunderstood by the people of the world generally. It is 
quite easily comprehended by the people of the Latter-day Saints, be- 
cause, as a matter of fact, this great prophecy has been fulfilled, fulfilled 
in the present age. I refer you to our Doctrine and Covenants, 
section 110, relating to certain visions and manifestation given to 
the Prophet Joseph Smith in the Kirtland Temple. Those were very 
remarkable visions ; nothing quite like them in this age of the world ; 
nothing quite like them in any other age, except the manifestation given 
to Paul, the apostle, when he was caught up into heaven and beheld un- 
utterable things. 

In this manifestation the Savior appeared and stood upon the 
pulpit of the temple, and spoke to his servant, the Prophet, and to Oliver 
Cowdery, expressing his approval of the work that had been done in the 
building of that temple, and referring to the blessings that would result 
therefrom. Other glorious manifestations were given. 

THE COMING OF ELIJAH 

Finally, it was also said in section 110: 

"After this vision had closed, another great and glorious vision burst upon 
us; for Elijah ithe jprophet, who was taken to heaven without tasting dea ; th, 
stood before us, and said : 

"Behold, the time has fully come, which was spoken of by the mouth of. 
Malachi— testifying that he (Elijah) should be sent, before the great aind 
dreadful day of the Lord come — 

"To turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the children to the 
fathers, lest the whole earth be smitten with a curse — 

"Therefore, the keys of this dispensation are committed into your hands ; and 



78 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



by this ye may know that the great and dreadful day of- the Lord is near, even at 
the doors." 

So this important prophecy, that comes out of the past, has been 
fulfilled in the present, and in a manner connecting the past with the 
present. We cannot, my' brethren and sisters, as a people, neither can 
the children of men, separate and detach absolutely the past from the 
present. 

THE WORD "TURN" 

Now, in respect to this word "turn," we do not understand that 
that means that the fathers should simply assume a sympathetic attitude 
toward their children, that the children should have a sympathetic at- 
titude toward their fathers, their fathers being dead. It means,_ if 
we may rely upon the word of the latter-day prophet, Joseph Smith, 
that the word "turn" should be translated "bind or seal," and if that be 
the case what a flood of light is thrown upon this important matter ! It 
signifies that a work must be done for the dead and that we are to 
manifest our faith in the Gospel and in the prediction that has been 
made, by our work. Perhaps I might read a word or two from the 
history of the Church by the Prophet: 

"Now the word 'turn' here should be translated 'bind or seal'. But what is 
the object of this important mission, or how is it to be fulfilled? The_ key& 
are to be delivered; the spirit of Elijah is to come; the Gospel to be established; 
the Saints of God gathered; Zion built up; and the Saints to come up as saviors 
upon Mount Zion. But how lare they to become saviors on Mount Zion? By 
building their temples, erecting their baptismal fonts, land going forth and 
receiving all the ordinances, baptisms, confirmations, washings, anointings, 
ordinations and sealing powers, upon their heads, in behalf of lall !their progen- 
itors who are dead, and redeem them, that they might come forth in the first 
resurrection and be exalted to thrones of glory with them, and herein is 'the 
chain that binds the hearts of the fathers to the children and the children to 
the fathers, which fulfils the mission of Elijah." 

WORK FOR THE DEAD 

Possibly some one will say : "Well, are we really required then 
to do work for the dead?" Yes, surely to do a great work.- Is that not 
indicated in the scriptures, that a work should be done for the dead, 
when the Apostle Paul said : "Else what shall they do which are 
baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? Why are they then 
baptized for the dead?" So you see that Paul, the Apostle, understood 
this principle of baptism for the dead. 

BY PROXY 

The question will naturally arise : "Well, how is it possible for one 
to stand for another in respect to this matter, one on the earth being 
baptized for one who is dead? It is done through the principle of 
proxy, a principle which is well established in the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ. He, himself, the Savior of the world, stood as proxy for the 
children of men, as set forth by the great principle of atonement. This 
work for the dead is to be done in a temple and, I may here say that 
wherever the people of God are to be found upon the earth, you will 



PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAWSON 



79 



find a temple-building people, and even now we are sitting under the 
eaves, as it were, of the temple of God — the temple, doubtless, that 
Isaiah saw in visioni— the mountain of the Lord's house that was 'to be 
established in the tops of the mountains. I believe that the temple seen 
by Isaiah is the temple that stands adjacent to the tabernacle in which 
we are now assembled, and let me add we have other temples, some 
six in number. 

THE CONNECTING LINK 

We are permitted, under the gracious mercy of the Lord, my breth- 
ren and sisters, to go into these temples if we are worthy, and to do a 
work for the dead. We should be wide awake to the importance of this 
matter, because we are told that they, the dead, without us cannot be 
made perfect, and that we without our dead cannot be made perfect. 
Temple work is the link that connects us with our progenitors in the 
spirit world. Will the Gospel be preached to them? Surely it will be 
preached in the spirit world to them who had not the privilege of hear- 
ing it in this world. We are told in the epistle of Peter: 

"For this cause was the Gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they 
may be judged according to men in the flesh, but live 'according to God in the 
spirit." 

Oh, the beauty of the justice and mercy of God, who is no respecter 
of persons ! And let it be remembered that what it takes to save one who 
is living, it takes just that much to save one who is dead. Therefore, 
brethren and sisters, look well to this matter, and let your hearts be 
turned toward the dead, and avail yourselves of the opportunity of 
sealing them to the living. 

May the Lord bless us. May the Lord bestow upon us the spirit, 
the desire and the determination to hunt up and secure a record of our 
forefathers, and then to go forth and perform this important labor in 
their behalf. 

I know that this is the Church of God. I testify to you in all 
solemnity that I do know that Jesus is the Christ and that Joseph Smith 
was and is a true prophet of God. 

The great truth that I have emphasized here today came through 
this modern prophet, and surely there were few greater prophets than 
he. God's blessings I invoke upon you in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

The congregation arose and sang the first two verses of the hymn, 
"Do what is right." 

ELDER ELIAS S. WOODRUFF 

President of the Western States Mission 

The opening song of the conference was "We thank thee, O God, 
for a prophet." President Grant said in his opening remarks that 
when he sang that song he thought of the Prophet Joseph Smith. 



80 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Many times recently I have sung that song with great pleasure, and I 
have thought of President Heber J. Grant, and his counselors, and of 
the Twelve, and of those brethren who are appointed with them to be 
prophets, seers and revelators to this people. Without reservation I 
have been able to sing it with great joy and thanksgiving because we 
do have these men to "guide us in these latter days." It is a great 
anchor to this people. We go out among other people who are not 
thus blessed, who are trying to find out something about God, and 
they are groping in darkness. They may be following the rules of 
logic and reason to the best of their ability, but they are not guided by 
inspiration as we are. 

In the Western States mission we have nearly seven thousand 
members of the Church. Any of them would be delighted to be present 
here today, as a few of them are, to listen to the inspired words of 
God's servants and to enjoy the spirit of this remarkable gathering. 
When I think of the greatness of this conference, as shown by the 
numbers of those who attend, I sometimes think that if all the members 
of the Church in the Western States mission were gathered in this 
tabernacle, it would be quite comfortably filled ; and yet they are only 
a handful, as compared to the Church. Our Church is becoming 
numerous, and it is spread over every portion of the earth. The Gospel 
has been carried to nearly every part of the earth, and men and women 
have received it with joy and gladness. 

I wonder sometimes if when we think of our missionary work we 
do not think of it as wholly missionary work; but quite an important 
part of our labors consists in looking after the interests of the saints 
who are organized in small branches throughout our missions. The 
time is coming, and coming with great speed, when the larger of our 
branches will assume something of the perfectness of the wards 
of the Church. We are beginning to do things, in some of the branches, 
as they do them in the wards. Our auxiliary organization are following 
the splendid lead given to them by those who head these auxiliary 
organizations. Our manuals and our Church magazines are informative 
and helpful to them. Our people read them with joy and gladness and 
follow their instructions — so much so that the branches are becoming a 
little more proficient all the time in the work of teaching each other. 

The spirit and genius of this Church is that we help each other. 
Sometimes members of the Church get the impression that those who 
are unworthy or unfit should be cast out, and not permitted to enter 
into the house of worship. We welcome them that they may grow with 
us from a degree of weakness to a degree of strength. The 
Church was intended to be an organization for mutual helpfulness, and 
so Latter-day Saints are expected, and it is their duty, to help each 
other, to labor together for the improvement of each other. 

Our branches are doing those things with some degree of excel- 
lence. The missionaries are carrying on satisfactory work. We are 
doing our best, with the few that we have, to reach the people, to carry 



ELDER ELI AS S. WOODRUFF 



81 



the message of the Gospel to them, trying to find better means all the 
time of engaging the attention of the people. 

Last night, when I read that our Station K-S-L was to become 
a fifty thousand watt station, my heart rejoiced, because I realized that 
it would be possible, at least in the Western States mission, and I am 
sure in many other missions, to hear not only the Tabernacle Organ 
concerts, which are now nationally broadcast, but to hear the sermons 
that our brethren preach, with some degree of certainty and clearness. 
Sometimes we hear them ; sometimes we do not. If we could depend 
upon them — and I am sure we will be able to do so with that powerful 
station operating — it would be a simple matter for us to organize 
cottage meetings on Sunday evenings, and have small groups, directed 
by Elders or sisters, meet together to hear the sermon, and then perhaps 
continue the service by bearing testimonies and singing the songs of 
Zion, and thus increase in the hearts of people faith in God. 

Many of our friends who are not members of the Church listen in 
on the radio and are delighted with the organ recitals and with the 
sermons when they are able to hear them. Truly the Lord is utilizing, 
through his servants, the wonderful instruments of this great day for 
publishing the Gospel. 

I pray the Lord to bless you. I pray the Lord to bless those 
whose children are on missions, and who are making the struggle 
that they must of necessity make to care for them. I appeal to you 
fathers and mothers of missionaries — and I think you will hear this 
appeal — don't send them too much money. In spite of the hard times 
we do have a few parents who insist on sending their missionaries 
more than they need. They would be ever so much better missionaries 
if you limited them to forty dollars a month, or a little less than 
that, than they will be if you send them fifty. At least I am speaking 
for the Western States. I would rather know that our missionaries 
could have only forty dollars a month, than to know that they could 
have more. That should not be hard advice to take these days, and 
yet I know of some parents who say : "Well, my son or my daughter 
must not be deprived. We are willing tp deprive ourselves but they 
must have what they need." I want to testify to you that they will 
do much better if you will accept this advice. I know one young man 
whose parents sent him so much money that it almost ruined his 
mission. Finally the father and mother came out to see him. They 
were convinced that they had been making a mistake. They rectified 
the mistake, and tloday the boy is humble and sweet in his spirit, as 
energetic as he can be, filling a splendid mission, and happy to know 
that his source of revenue has been cut off, so that he has to depend 
upon his own efforts for his blessings. 

I want to say, with gratitude, that we are all well, with the ex- 
ception of one Elder, and we think he is in no danger. We are grateful 
for the blessings of the Lord, grateful for his watch-care and his favor 
over us. I testify to you that he does bless us, that God lives, that 
Jesus is the Christ, and that this is his true work. Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ELDER JOHN V. BLUTH 

President of the Canadian Mission 

My brethren and sisters, it is a matter of delight to be able to 
meet with you in conference. When I look over this congregation I 
feel comforted by the assurance that I can say: "Brethren and sisters ;" 
that your spirits are in harmony, that you have come here to worship, 
that in your hearts there is a prayer for the speaker and for yourselves, 
that the speaker may be inspired in his utterances, that your hearts 
may be receptive, and that you may receive strength and benefit from 
that which is spoken. 

I bring you greetings from the Saints, the Elders and sisters laboring 
in the Canadian mission. Wle have a glorious clay for our conference, 
and we have had practically this kind of glorious weather during the 
entire summer in the Canadian mission — only a few hot, sultry days ; 
nothing like that which our people have experienced in the western 
part of Canada and here. We rejoice in the delightful climate and the 
delightful country in which we have to labor. Eastern Canada, to me, 
is a glorious land, a land of forest, lake and stream. The province 
of Ontario alone has a hundred and fifty thousand square miles of 
forest, and as the country is a rolling country it lends itself to a myriad 
of lakes and streams that are delightful to the eye. It is a paradise to 
the tourist, one who desires to see nature and to rest himself for a few 
weeks or months, as the case might be and his time permits, in that land. 
We rejoice in that glorious country, in the privilege of being there, and 
of drinking in its beauty and having it enter into our souls. 

Recently we have completed our third missionary trip since we 
went up to Canada in January — my wife and I and the secretary of 
the mission covering thirty-two hundred miles in making the circuit, 
which represented the eastern part of the mission, the western having 
already been covered. We held thirty-five meetings, and mingled with 
the Saints. We took three weeks for the trip. Brother Ballard visited 
it in June in shorter time. He visited the same part in twelve days, 
but it was holding meeting and catching train, holding meeting and 
catching train ; very little opportunity to get very close to the people 
themselves ; and for that reason we took a little more time. 

In our meetings we have devoted about one-half of the time in 
defense of the principles of the Gospel, answering attacks upon the 
doctrines of the Church. The other half we have devoted to the one 
thing that we think very essential: We feel that we are sent into the 
world to warn the people and to give them the message of the Gospel. 
When we have done this we must depend upon the Spirit of the Lord 
to enter into their hearts, convert them to the Gospel, and bring them 
into the fold. 

We also feel that our duty lies with those who have already ac- 
cepted the Gospel, and that time must be given to hold them in the 
faith and to point out to them that which many of them cannot under- 
stand. In the world a great many people feel that they are "saved," 



ELDER JOHN V. BLUTH 



S3 



that by confessing the name of Jesus Christ they have already, at a 
certain hour, on a. certain date, in a certain place, become saved, and 
therefore they need not investigate the truth anywhere else. [Some of 
our Saints, after having entered into baptism, received the gift of the 
Holy Ghost, and become members of the Church, feel that by attending 
only a few meetings they are doing their full duty. To my mind it 
seems that they have only advanced a istep ahead of those who are 
still outside of the pale of the Church, and their entire journey still 
lies before them,_ the straight and the narrow |way, the continual re- 
pentance from things that are evil in their nature, bringing themselves 
nearer unto God. We have devoted a great deal of time in an en- 
deavor to convince them that their mission is not finished, that their 
salvation is not secure, unless they continue -faithful in the keeping of 
the commandments of God. We have told them that blessings come 
through obedience, that our Father has said : "I, the Lord, am bound 
when ye do what I say, but when ye do not what I say ye have no 
promise." i 1 , 

We call their attention to the necessity of prayer, of living close 
to God, citing them the fact that in the early days the saints were 
afflicted because they did not keep the laws of God, did not seek him 
closely. I remember that the Lord has said, in one of the sections of 
the Doctrine and Covenants, that "in the day of their peace they 
esteemed lightly my counsel ; but, in the day of their trouble, of 
necessity they feel after me." 

We seek to teach them that they should so live that when adversity 
comes they can go to God with an assurance in their hearts that because 
they have sought to live his commandments, because they have been 
in touch with him in the days of their prosperity, he will answer 
their prayers ; that they may not be like the man who, when in a 
dangerous position, knelt and prayed to God to save him, and, to make 
sure of an answer, said : "O Father, I have never troubled you before. 
Help me now." 

Our idea is to be in touch with him continuously, seeking his 
heip and his assistance, and giving unto him our praises, our rejoicing 
in the many blessings he has given unto us. 

I rejoiced here today, while listening to the opening hymn of this 
afternoon's session : 

"Come, come, ye Saints, no toil nor labor fear, 
But with joy wend your way." 
Compare the condition of the Saints some eighty-five years ago, 
when ' that was written, with the conditions under which we wor- 
ship here! I think of them plodding over the rain-sodden plains 
of Iowa, some four hundred miles, in order to reach the Missouri 
river, half -clad, starved, weary. That song was written to cheer 
their souls while they surrounded the camp fires, and to give them 
new courage for their labors of the following day, knowing that 
when thev reached the Missouri river they still had another thousand 
miles of land travel before them, and that in hostile country. Compare 



84 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



that with the conditions under which we worship here, and then talk 
about adversity and depression ! 

There are so many things which of late have become necessities 
that at one time werg luxuries, and a few years earlier were not even 
heard of. If we really thought so, we could dispense with them today, 
and thereby lessen the depression we now suffer. 

Brother McKay, in an earlier meeting, spoke of testing the spirits ; 
and in our missionary meeting held on Wednesday there were many 
reports of the wonderful assistance of our Heavenly Father, as mani- 
fested in healings, in guidance under difficult circumstances, in pro- 
viding for the missionaries on the highway, in their meetings, and in 
other capacities, showing that the Lord was with them and helping 
them ; that there was power in the Gospel, and that the gifts and bless- 
ings follow the believers. 

An interesting incident occurred in our mission, in which the 
blessing of God followed even a non-member, but the blessing did 
not benefit him. A man studying for the Baptist ministry became 
interested in the teaching's of the Elders. He listened to them and de- 
clared his belief in what was stated as the truth. He learned that they 
had the gifts and blessings in the Church. He was afflicted with 
cancer, and his life despaired of. He lost all appetite and was unable 
to move about or to do anything much for himself. He asked the 
Elders — two of them — a young brother from Ogden and one from 
Salt Lake, to come and administer unto him. After questioning 
him, feeling of his spirit, probing his .sincerity, they decided to 
administer to him. They did so and he was healed completely. Later 
on he was able to attend to his work, restored fully to his health, 
vitality, and the life that had been despaired of. A few weeks later, 
after having further investigated the principles of the Gospel, he asked 
for baptism, and was baptized. Several weeks later he fell out over 
some little money matter with a member of the Church, became pos- 
sessed of an unforgiving spirit, and absolutely refused to make matters 
right. From that time until this he has become so possessed of the 
evil power that he will walk the streets where street meetings are held, 
and laugh and deride and make fun of the Elders. He has threatened 
them with violence, telling them that if they came near him he would 
mark them for life. He says that he does not believe in them and 
that the members of the Church are all liars and hypcrites. That 
spirit has so taken possession of him that he is far worse than he was 
before the time when he received this wonderful manifestation from 
God, and from what I learned in the conference held two weeks ago 
the affliction is coming back upon him. That is testing another kind of 
spirit than that of which we have heard today. 

I pray God that he may bless us, that we may be faithful, keep our 
covenants with God, do everything that he desires, be ready to respond 
to every call and serve him so faithfully that when we have finished 
our work here upon the earth we may be counted worthy to dwell in 
his presence, and I ask it in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen, 



ELDER GEORGE S. ROMNEY

ELDER GEORGE S. ROMNEY 

President of the Northern States Mission 

I have the privilege of representing seventy-four young men and 
women who are preaching the Gospel in the Northern States mission, 
also more than seven thousand Latter-day Saints who are there I 
should like to tell you, if I can, something about the way these mis- 
sionaries are meeting the great social problems which are confronting 
the people there. 

Just a few days ago, a man from Toledo, Ohio, who claims a 
membership in the Church, came to my office to ask for some help. He 
said that he and his wife had been hunting over the city of Chicago for 
many days for work. I asked him the condition of the many men whom 
we see sitting on the park benches and other places, idle, in the city 
of Chicago. He said : "Come and go with me tonight, and I will take 
you down on the lake front and show you twenty-five thousand men 
or more — men who are willing to work and want work, and men who 
have nothing to eat." I went down through the subway under Michigan 
Avenue, and there I saw men in crowds, lying on the ground, with 
just a newspaper under them, keeping warm by the fires that they made 
from boxes that they had gathered from the stores. 

This man said to me that he had made all the efforts that he could, 
and if it came to the worst, he had told his wife the day before that he 
would get a gun and go down-town and get food for her to eat. There 
are many of the larger steel mills, automobile factories and others, that 
are only employing now from forty to sixty percent of their men. 

These social problems produce a feeling of unrest, and the think- 
ing people are facing these problems and wondering how to meet them. 

The feeling is growing, in the colleges and in the universities, 
that our problems must be solved, not by legislation, but by estab- 
lishing character in the youth as they grow up, and in the people. 

A minister of the Presbyterian church recently invited me to 
speak to his congregation. I asked him to suggest a subject and he 
said : "Tell us how the Latter-day Saints are meeting the social and 
economic problems which the world is facing at the present time." I had 
the privilege of explaining to them something about the law of tithing, 
and fast donations, and the way we take care of our poor through the 
wards and the Relief Societies. I also explained to them something 
of the character of the education which we give in our Sunday Schools, 
and Mutual Improvement, and other auxiliary organizations. After 
the meeting was over, the way that group of people gathered around 
and asked their questions indicated the interest which people are taking 
in these social problems. 

Recently one of the boys (missionaries) wrote me that he had been 
traveling on the highway, and was picked up by the vice-president of 
one of the railroads. This Elder and his companion were invited to 
the home of this gentleman and had a long conversation. This official 
of the railroad expressed himself, as the boys were leaving, that he

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



considered the type of work that they were doing was of the very 
highest nature. He said that if they could carry that spirit among the 
people, and get others to feel as they felt, (that they were willing to 
spend their time in teaching principles of such value) that it would 
help to solve the problems. 

We have many other incidents which I thought I would tell you, but 
cannot, of men who have expressed themselves in a similar way. That 
is, that the teaching, by example, of young men and women who are 
willing to spend their time, sustaining themselves while they are doing 
it, makes an impression. It is an object lesson that impresses the people 
of the world. 

Thinking men, so far as intellectuality is concerned, appreciate 
the work of the Latter-day Saints. 

But there is another way by which men and women are impressed 
by the work of the missionaries that is in addition to and I think far 
greater than this intellectual way. It is illustrated by a gentleman with 
whom I rode a few days ago, who is now a member of the Church. 
For a long time his wife was a member of the Church, and had been 
actively working, but he was in opposition. He was a user of tobacco. 
There was scarcely an hour or minute that he did not have tobacco 
in some form in his mouth. He said to me that he used foul language, 
that he was in opposition to the Church and felt that he treated his 
wife all the time in a very undesirable way. He went to a Relief Society 
meeting with his wife, not at her request, but just through a suggestion 
of his own. He sat and listened to the testimonies^ — because it was a 
testimony meeting — of some of the sisters, and he expressed himself 
something like this : 

"While I was sitting there listening to them, a feeling came over 
me that passed through me from my head to my feet. I can't describe 
it, but it was such a feeling that it made the tears stream from my 
eyes. I felt myself crying. I felt ashamed. I did not know what was 
the matter with me." He said : "I went home. I threw my tobacco 
away, and from that day to this I have never touched it. I have 
treated my wife as I should do." He is now a president of the Mutual 
Improvement organization, and is a very fine man. 

It is that type of thing, wherein men and women change their 
lives, because the Spirit of the Lord comes over them, that will solve 
our social problems. 

I am appreciative of the work I am doing, and testify to you that 
I know that the Lord does inspire the hearts of people through his 
Spirit. I pray the Lord to bless us, that we may all have the spirit of 
missionary work, and I do it in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

The congregation sang the hymn, "Lord dismiss us with Thv 
blessing." 

After the benediction, which was pronounced by Elder Edward C. 
Rich, President of the Montpelier Stake, the Conference adjourned 
until 10:00 o'clock Sunday morning, October 4, 1931. 



THIRD DAY 

MORNING MEETING 

The Conference reconvened Sunday morning, October 4, 1931 at 
10 o'clock. 

The great tabernacle auditorium and galleries were filled to capacity 
every seat being taken and all available space in the aisles and doorways 
being occupied by people who were unable to find seats. Thousands 
who could not be accommodated in the tabernacle congregated in the 
large Assembly Hall directly south of the tabernacle and on the taber- 
nacle grounds, where they listened to the Conference proceedings as they 
were broadcast by radio. 

President Heber J. Grant presided. 

As an opening number the Tabernacle Choir and the congregation 
sang the hymn, "Praise to the man who communed with Jehovah." 

The invocation was offered by Elder S. Norman Lee, President 
of the Box Elder Stake. 

"An angel from on high," duet and chorus, was rendered by Cyril 
Martin and Ida Hepworth and the Choir. 

PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 

First Counselor in the First Presidency 

My brethren and sisters, I stand before you this morning in humility 
and humbly ask that during the few moments of time I expect to occupy 
I may have your sympathy, the support of your faith, and the help of 
the Lord, that I may clearly outline to you the thoughts which I have 
in my mind. 

I am going to read from the Book of Isaiah, 19th chapter, 19th 
and 20th verses : ! 

"In that clay shall there be an altar to the Lord in the midst of the land 
of Egypt, and a pillar at the border thereof to the Lord. 

"And it shall be for a sign and for a witness unto the Lord of hosts in the 
land of Egypt: for they shall cry unto the Lord because of the oppressors, and 
he shall send them a savior, and a great one, and he shall deliver them." 

REFERS TO BOOK 

I have read this scripture, my brethren and sisters, as a basis for 
the brief remarks that I expect to make in regard to a matter that has 
caused more or less discussion among members of the Church because 
of the recent publication of this small book which I hold in my hand. 
The title of the book is "Our Bible in Stone." The author is Francis 
M. Darter of Los Angeles, a member of the Church, in good standing, 
an experienced engineer and a mathematician of ability. 

It treats principally the erection, symbolism and prophetic char- 
acter of the pyramid of Gizeh, or in Greek, Cheops. Various other 



88 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



applications so far as the name is concerned have been applied to this 
structure. Because of its superiority over all other like structures it 
has come to be known and referred to as the Great Pyramid of Gizeh. 

SITUATED IN EGYPT 

The Great Pyramid of Gizeh is situated in Egypt, about ten miles 
west of the city of Cairo, and one hundred and twenty-five miles south 
from the city of Alexandria, which was founded by Alexander the 
Great 332 B. C. It is bounded on the west by the Libyan desert, and 
is therefore in the borders of the land. It is one of a group of nine 
other similar structures, which are known as the Pyramids of Gizeh. 

It is a noteworthy fact that while many pyramids are found in 
Egypt, none is known to exist in other parts of the world except in 
America, where many such structures are known to have been erected, 
but no other pyramids can be compared with the unusual structure to 
which my remarks are to be confined. 

The orientation of the great pile, as it applies to the points of the 
compass, and the accuracy with which its proportions are related one 
to the other, are a marvel to those who have made a study of it. 

GOVERNED BY STARS 

The relationship of the Pyramid to modern mathematics, by which 
scholars have endeavored to fix the date of its construction, indicates 
that in its erection the builders were familiar with and governed largely 
by the movement of the heavenly bodies, which science the moderns 
refer to as astronomy. 

Sir John Herschel, from astronomical calculation, places the con- 
struction of the Pyramid at 2160 B. C., and Professor Piazza Smyth 
at 2170 B. C. Basil Stewart, in his recently published book, "The 
Witness of the Great Pyramid," after a careful study of the application 
of astronomy in its construction, says : 

"The Great Pyramid therefore may be considered the earliest known record 
in existence wherein is embodied the fact of the immense cycle known as 
the precession of the equinoxes." 

OF GREAT MAGNITUDE 

The magnitude of the structure may be best understood by comparing 
it with something with which we are familiar. The area covered by 
the base of the structure is in excess of thirteen acres, or three acres 
larger than the block upon which this building stands, which is ten 
acres. The height of the Pyramid is 485 feet above the base, or more 
than twice the height of the temple to the east of us. The bulk of 
the building is more than ninety million cubic feet, and sufficient stone 
was used in its construction to build a wall four feet high and two 
teet thick, twenty-two hundred miles in length, or which would reach 
from Chicago to San Francisco. 

THE BUILDERS 

Who were the builders of the Pyramid no one knows. Khufu 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. WINS 



89 



(Cheops, in Greek) is given credit for having been the builder. This- 
personage has been identified by some students as Seth, the son of 
Adam; others give Enoch, the son of Jared, credit for having been 
the builder ; others Shem, the Son of Noah ; while some believe that 
Melchizedek, that mysterious personage to whom Abraham paid tithes, 
and whom some of these scholars identify as the Patriarch Job, was 
the person who constructed it. 

Herodotus, who lived nearly five hundred years before the birth 
of Christ, and who is referred to as the father of history, knew of the 
existence of the Great Pyramid, and wrote concerning it. He says 
that the Egyptians detested the memory of the kings who caused their 
fathers to erect these structures, and besides compelled them to close 
their own temples, and for this reason they were not willing to mention 
their names, but called the two first pyramids erected after Philition, 
a shepherd who fed his cattle about the place. 

Manetho, himself an Egyptian, wrote as follows: 

"There came from the east, in a strange manner, men of an ignoble race, 
who had the confidence to invade our country, and easily subdued it by their 
power without a battle. All this invading nation was styled Hyksos, that is, 
'Shepherd Kings'." 

He then relates how they departed for Judea and built a city 
there named Jerusalem. This he says was long before the exodus of 
the Israelitish people from Egypt under Moses. 

OLD THEORY CHALLENGED 

It is known that Hyksos, or Shepherd Kings, dominated Egypt 
at the time that Jacob and his family went into that country, during 
the period when Joseph ruled as vice regent of the reigning Pharaoh, 
and it was among this people that Joseph chose his wife, Asenath, 
who became the mother of his sons Ephraim and Manasseh. 

The first definite suggestion that the Great Pyramid was other 
than the tomb of a king, or other merely temporal monument, was in 
a work written by John Taylor in London in 1859. He conceived 
the idea that it was a divinely planned and constructed monument, 
designed to be a witness to the human race, showing in advance the 
history of mankind from the creation to the period of the second 
coming of our Lord, who would establish dominion over the earth 
upon which we dwell and usher in a reign of righteousness and peace. 

At a later date C. Piazza Smyth, astronomer royal of Scotland, 
wrote upon the subject, agreeing with the conclusions reached by Taylor. 
Sir W. M. Flinders Petrie, Professor John Edgar, D. Davidson, Joseph 
A. Seiss, Sir John Herschel, Basil Stewart and many other scholarly 
men, after making a study of the subject, became advocates of the 
theory advanced by Taylor, that the Great Pyramid has something 
more than human in its construction and symbolism. 

THE INTERIOR 

For ages after its construction the interior of the Great Pyramid 



90 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



remained a sealed mystery. Obsessed with the belief that within the 
great pile hordes of treasure had been concealed, men finally determined 
to penetrate and explore it. A tunnel was driven into the structure far 
towards the center, but the work was so difficult that it was about to 
be discontinued when the workmen unexpectedly broke into the passage- 
way, and the mystery was solved. 

Nothing was found to indicate that the Pyramid had been con- 
structed to be the tomb of a king, as was usually the case with the 
smaller structures of like architecture. It was discovered that the 
original builders had constructed a series of passages or galleries in 
the interior of the Pyramid, the entrance to which had been concealed 
and so strongly closed that it became necessary to blast around it in 
order that entrance might be made possible. This entrance is on the 
north side of the structure, and the first gallery or passage descends 
from the opening at an angle of about twenty-six degrees to a point 
far below the floor of the Pyramid into the solid rock upon which it 
stands, where it terminates in a chamber which is called the Pit. 

A short distance from the entrance, at the same angle, another 
passageway leads upward and communicates with two other chambers, 
one referred to as the Queen's Chamber, near the center, and the other, 
higher up, as the King's Chamber. 

CONCLUSIONS OF SCHOLARS 

It is the accuracy with which these galleries are constructed and 
certain markings and steps which are placed at intervals along the 
way, that have convinced scholars who have made careful study of the 
subject that the Pyramid was intended by its builders to represent the 
history of our race, as has been stated, from the remote past to the 
time of the second coming of our Lord. 

Discussion of the symbolism of the Great Pyramid is not a new 
thing in the Church. I well remember that Orson Pratt, during his 
lifetime, lectured on the subject and made mathematical calculations 
by which he reached the conclusion that certain measurements of the 
galleries and markings which were upon them had reference to the 
opening of the Gospel dispensation in which we live, and the final 
consummation of the purposes of our Father in heaven, by which peace 
would come to the world and happiness to mankind. 

I remember also that his calculations brought conclusions which 
differed from others who had made a study of the subject, but were 
in the main the same. Soon after the World War students of the 
Pyramid announced that according to their theory, and it is only a 
theory, the year 1928 would witness the beginning of a period of 
tribulation which would continue with increasing intensity until 1936, 
and would bring sorrow and mourning to the inhabitants of the earth. 
At that date their symbols and measurements bring us to the King's 
Chamber, and the record of the Pyramid, if it has a record, will cease 
with the advent of our Lord and the establishment of a period of peace, 
happiness and good will among men.

QUESTIONS CONCLUSIONS 

The Church has not at any time, nor does it now, accept the conclu- 
sions of pyramid students to be definitely correct. In fact there is 
great doubt that the arbitrary basis upon which their calculations and 
conclusions are founded is correct-. 

I do not wish to be understood to say that they are in error. Neither 
do I say that they are correct. But this much I desire to declare to 
this congregation : While I have not given profound study to the theories 
of men regarding the origin and symbolism of this miracle in stone, I 
have read and studied it in a general way and have found nothing in it 
to convince me that the record of the Great Pyramid definitely forecasts 
coming events. 

OTHER SOURCES 

The Church does not depend upon Pyramids of Gizeh nor the 
conclusions of scientific investigators, however helpful they may some- 
times be in the study of these questions, for an interpretation of the 
scripture which refers to the return of Christ our Lord to earth and 
the millennium of peace and good-will which is to be enjoyed under his 
personal administration. 

We believe in the literal gathering of the house of Israel, that 
Judah and Benjamin will be united with Ephraim and the ten tribes 
from whom they have been separated since the reign of Rehoboam, the 
son of Solomon ; that Zion will be built upon this continent ; that Christ 
our Lord will reign personally among his people; and that the earth 
will be restored to its paradisaical glory. 

This declaration of our faith is based upon the words of our 
Lord as they are contained in the Bible, and have come to us through 
modern revelation. 

PRECEDING HIS SECOND COMING 

As Jesus sat upon the Mount of Olives the disciples came to 
him privately, saying: 

"Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy 
coming, and of the end of the world?" 

Our Lord warned them to take heed lest they be deceived. He 
told them that preceding the time of his coming there would be a 
period when war would prevail throughout the world; that nation 
would rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and that 
there would be famine and pestilences and earthquakes in divers places ; 
that those who believed in him would suffer persecution, and that 
tribulation such as had never before been known would be experienced. 
But he assured them that those who had faith to endure to the end 
would be saved. 

He told them that before his coming the Gospel which he taught 
would be restored to earth and preached among all people, as a witness, 
before the end should come. And then he said, "shall appear the 



92 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



sign of the Son of man in heaven * * * and they shall see the Son of 
man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory." 

At the time of his ascension, when the cloud received him, as 
his disciples gazed in wonder and astonishment, two men in white 
apparel appeared and said : 

"Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing np into heaven? this same Jesus, 
which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have 
seen him go into heaven." 

The affirmation of the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ 
and the further fact that he would at a subsequent period of time return 
to earth to assume control over its affairs and usher in a millennium 
of peace are so definitely attested that no real believer in the Bible can 
deny them. 

EXACT TIME NOT REVEALED 

Conditions which would prevail prior to his glorious appearance 
are definitely stated, but the exact time when he shall appear has not 
been revealed. He himself says, referring to the time of his glorious 
appearance : "But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not 
the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father." 

He does tell us that he will come in an hour when we expect 
him not and warns us that we must always be prepared to meet him. 
He warns us further that if at that time we are found oppressing our 
brethren and eating and drinking with the drunken he will cut us off, 
root, and branch, which will cause weeping and wailing and gnashing 
of teeth. 

THE AUTHOR'S OWN VIEWS 

Now, my brethren and sisters, I have referred to this little book 
and its contents as I desire that you might understand. It will un- 
doubtedly go into the mission field and our Elders may make use of it. 
I simply want to warn you against sensationalism of any kind. 

While the author, as I have stated, is a member of the Church in 
full standing, this work goes out as his own views. I do not wish 
to deprecate the amount of work he must have applied in the prepara- 
tion of this book, in the study of the scriptures, and in the preparation 
of the charts which are contained in it. I do not say that his conclu- 
sions are wrong, but I do say that they do not come to us as the voice 
of the Church, nor are they to be accepted as such. 

TROUBLES FORECAST 

Brother J. Golden Kimball told us yesterday that he was a great 
believer in dreams that come true. I am reminded of the fact that im- 
mediately after the close of the World War these students of the 
Pyramids announced and published it that according to their measure- 
ments and calculations there would begin in the year 1928 a period 
which would bring tribulation and sorrow to the people of the world ; 
that they would be required to humble themselves before the Lord, and 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY jV. IVINS 



93 



that that period of tribulation would continue until the year 1936. 
This was based entirely upon the measurement of the galleries and 
the steps that are in the Pyramids. 

We all know that a part of this dream at least has come true. Men 
come to us and tell us that there is no depression; that it is only our 
imagination. It is true that we are surrounded by plenty, but in the 
midst of plenty many are in want. Such talk to me is sheer nonsense. 
My father-in-law, Erastus Snow, used to say that such statements 
reminded him of a man trying to hold himself up by his own boot- 
straps. When Great Britain who has stood in the ages past as a 
financial master of the world sends out cries for financial help; when 
Germany who stands in the very forefront of the nations of the world 
in intellectual development ,in music, in chemistry, in mechanism, sends 
out calls for help, and is on the very verge of dissolution and anarchy, 
it is obvious that there is somethng wrong. 

TRIBULATIONS EVIDENT 

When our own government is wrestling with problems which they 
hardly know how to control, but are doing their very best to meet them ; 
when banking establishments are going down like block-houses, and 
hundreds of millions of dollars of the savings of poor people are being 
lost to them because of these failures, it appears obvious to me that 
we are passing through a time of tribulation. I believe it is better 
at any rate that we should think so. I agree with the Governor of 
our state in his declaration that we are in a period which requires 
our most careful attention and our best efforts to avert. If there 
are those who do not believe it they will find it out before we are 
through with it. 

DEFENDS BANKS 

While I am on my feet I want to say one thing: This condition 
naturally brings trouble to banking institutions, and men are referring 
to banks as heartless usurers. Banks are not money-lenders alone, 
they are the custodians of the funds of the people. They do not lend 
their own money, they lend the money of the widow and the orphan 
and the fatherless which has been entrusted to them. They make 
investment of it that it may bring returns to these people who so greatly 
need it, and it is their sacred duty to preserve those funds to save them 
from loss. When men go to banks and borrow money they must do 
it with the expectation that they are to pay it back. It is not their 
money, it is not the money of the bank ; it is the money of the people. 
And so when banks are careful to preserve their resources and to keep 
them liquid, so they can meet the demands that are made upon them, 
they should be complimented and not found fault with. 

This brings me right back to another thing that the Redeemer said. 
He told us, you know, that there would be weeping and wailing among 
the merchants — or the prophet told us that — because there would be 
no one to buy their merchandise. We have very nearly lived to see 



94 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



that. He told us that it will be the same with the giver of usury as it is 
with the taker of usury from him. This is not a condition which 
affects one class of our citizens only, it affects men from the wealthy 
of our country to those who are in the most humble circumstances. 
Well, now, my brethren and sisters, what about it all ? 

TRUST THE LORD 

Just be calm and turn to the Lord. It is not the result of any 
occurrence of the immediate past. We have been gradually drifting 
toward it for years and years, and personally I have known that it 
would come, and I bore witness of it from this stand to the people 
a year ago. I applied it to my own affairs. I pleaded with the people 
to put their houses in order and get out of debt, for I knew this was 
coming, because God himself through his Only Begotten Son had 
declared it. 

There is nothing that men can do, nothing that we can do that will 
avert the fulfilment of those sayings, and it is not the design of our 
Father in heaven at all either. It is simply the result of our own lack 
of wisdom, of our own disposition to be selfish, of the accumulation of 
the wealth of the country in the hands of a few men, which prevents 
its equal distribution among the masses. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, if the Church has anything to say 
to you it will come from them direct and not from the writings of other 
men. It will come to you in a manner that you will understand it. It 
will not be speculative. It will come to you philosophically, truthfully 
and governed by common sense. 

God bless you, is my humble prayer, through Jesus Christ, Amen. 

PRESIDENT CHARLES W. NIBLEY 

Second Counselor in the First Presidency 

This is a wonderful gathering, wonderful from many angles, and 
from every point of view outstanding and remarkable. 

I enjoy working in the ministry and always have done from my 
youth up. I have enjoyed working for the Church, but I must confess 
that of all the work I have to do and of all the duties I am called 
upon to perform I always approach this duty with fear and trembling. 
I pray that you will assist me with your faith and your sympathy, and 
that I may have the blessing of the Lord and the Spirit of the Lord to 
season my remarks. 

OMINOUS SIGNS 

We have fallen upon strange times, as have been outlined by 
President Ivins, and the end is not yet. The distress of nations, not 
this nation alone, this people alone, but the distress of nations and the 
perplexity of nations is here now at the present time. There are signs 
about us that are ominous, in some ways almost terrible. 

President Moyle yesterday pointed out to us some of the difficulties, 



PRESIDENT CHARLES II'. NIBLEY 



95 



some of the obvious reasons that go to show how dreadful, and 
ominous, some of the signs of the times are. There is unemployment 
by the millions, men who would like to work, not the idler, but men 
who want to work and are able to work and can find no work. 

Nearly one hundred and fifty years ago the great Scottish poet 
sang in a doleful refrain of this very condition in his day : 

"See yonder poor o'er-labored wight, 
So abject, mean and vile. 
Who begs a brother of the earth 
To give him leave to toil. 
And see his lordly fellow-worm 
The poor petition spurn. 

Unmindful, though a weeping wife 
And helpless children mourn." 

Then he passes on to say : 

"Man's inhumanity to man 
Makes countless thousands mourn." 

TO ALLEVIATE DISTRESS. 

And so we have that condition today. Committees are appointed, 
and well appointed, in every state, and the very head of the nation, 
the president, has appointed his committee, able men, the ablest men 
who can be found — good men, men who are desirous of the good of 
the people — to see if something cannot be done to mitigate these hard 
conditions. In our own state we have committees appointed by the 
governor and the mayor, and in small towns and villages of the country 
committees are at work to see if they cannot help out in this present 
situation. The work of these committees is to see that those who have, 
give up and contribute to those who are in need. That is the sum 
and substance of it all. We have heard that labor organizations are 
rather threatening. 

England's navy 

We have heard of one of the most ominous signs of the time that 
has occurred in England. President Moyle, I think it was, said that 
the dole alone, in England, stands between that country and anarchy; 
and one of the worst signs we have had in the last few weeks is a 
mutiny in the English navy. The chancellor of the exchequer, Philip 
Snowden, in paring down expenses, taxing to the last degree — twenty- 
five per cent of all the income of the people, and large incomes taxed 
much higher than that — trying to make ends meet, trying to get enough 
to stabilize the English pound and carry on with the government, and 
everybody is making sacrifices — in doing this he pared down a little 
on the English navy's sailors' compensation and the result was mutiny 
in the navy — in England's navy — something unheard of, unbelievable. 
Hardly can we conceive that such a thing would transpire. That 
doesn't have a good look, because it has been the English navy that has 
done more for the world than any one can imagine. From the days 



96 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



that the Armada of Spain came up the channel to overthrow England 
and take possession of the country, in 1588, when Drake and Hawkins 
and a few of the bravest sailors and leaders ever known came out to 
defend their country, and did defend it, and in the goodness of the 
Almighty a strong wind was sent to blow that Armada up the channel 
and help out the weak English contingent. The outcome of it was 
that the British navy from that day took possession of the seas, and 
from that day to this has held that possession. It made Elizabeth, who 
was then queen, mistress of the seas. Spain became a second rate 
or a third rate power a little later on. 

And now, after such a wonderful record, a record that when the 
Wlorld War broke out seventeen years ago this summer the one instru- 
ment of war that was ready and right on the spot was the English 
navy, this thing has happened. These things do not have a good 
look. That matter of mutiny was just patched up. We have not heard 
of anybody being thrown into chains or prison. 

THE LORD'S PLAN 

Well, now, in all this distress are we left without the word of 
the Lord ? Has the Lord not provided a way out ? I think he has. A 
hundred years ago last March a revelation was given to the Prophet 
Joseph Smith. I read from Section 49, 19th and 20th verses : 

"For, behold, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the air, and that which 
cometh of the earth — " 

"I wish you to get that in your minds : "that which cometh of the 
earth," for when we come to think about it everything in the world 
that we have "cometh of the earth." We have not had anything of a 
material nature handed down from any other planet. And so this 
revelation says : i 

— "and that which cometh of the earth is ordained for the use of man for 
food, for raiment, and that he might have in abundance. 

"But it is not given that one man should possess that which is above another, 
wherefore the world lieth in sin." 

The revelation on the United Order had not yet been given. This 
revelation was given one hundred years ago last March, and has been 
in print for about a hundred years, and we have taken practically 
little note of it. We go on in the same old way. Of course, we do in 
some respects try to do a little more, I think, for our poor than many 
other people do. Some of us pay our tithes, and that tithing is ad- 
ministered for the good of the whole Church, every cent of it. We go 
on missions, our sons and daughters go, and they spend two or more 
years, I may say, working as in the United Order, working without 
money and without price for the benefit and salvation of others. And 
everyone who works faithfully at his mission comes back testifying, as 
I testify regarding my own case, that never in all the experiences of 
life was there a happier time than the missionary time. 

I have wondered if I would not be much happier, sleep better of 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. NIBLEY

nights, without trouble to a great extent, if I knew my family were 
provided for, just sufficient, not with riches, but sweet content, with 
enough. If that were the case why should I not give my whole time 
to the Church? 

IN MOSES' TIME 

In the days of ancient Israel, in the time of Moses, we find that 
the land, which we now mortgage and buy and sell, could not be 
alienated from the family to which it belonged, those who were born on 
it, so to speak. It belonged not only to those who were alive, but to 
the unborn generations as well. This is the law of Moses that I will 
read from Leviticus, chapter twenty-five: 

"The land shall not be sold forever : for the land is mine ; for ye are strangers 
and sojourners with me. 

"And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the 
land. 

"If thy brother be waxen poor, and hath sold away some of his possession, 
and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then shall he redeem that which his 
brother sold. 

"And if the man have none to redeem it, and himself be able to redeem it : 
"Then let him count the years of the sale thereof, and restore the overplus 
unto the man to whom he sold it ; that he may return unto hs possession. 

"But if he be not able to restore it to him, then that which is sold shall 
remain in the hand of him that hath bought it, until the year of jubilee: and in 
the jubilee it shall go out, and he shall return unto his possession." 

That was the law in olden times. People could not be dispossessed 
of their land. They did allow it to be sold, it seems, but there was a 
cloud on the title — it would revert back to the original possessor. 

EQUAL POSSESSIONS 

The Lord, in the revelation that I have read, given over a hun- 
dred years ago, states that it is not given that one man should possess 
that which is above another. I do not think that means that every 
man should have the same quantity of ground allotted to him. Every 
man shall be appointed to labor, just as our missionaries are now 
appointed to labor. The Presidency appoint presidents of missions, 
select the best men they can find who are qualified and who are willing 
and obedient, that is to say, obedient to righteous law, to take charge 
here and there. And so it would be if we had great, extensive opera- 
tions. Every man could be called to the work which he is most fitted 
to do, and he could do it, and the proceeds, the surplus, should remain 
with the Church, not the individual. 

NOT DESTRUCTIVE OF INITIATIVE 

I know that some will say, Well that destroys initiative. Nothing 
of the kind. I was on a mission in the Liverpool office for two years 
on my last mission and I labored with Wiilliam Budge and John 
Nicholson, two outstanding men. I labored under their direction. 
They had great initiative. They were men of ability and capacity 
far more than I because I was younger, only twenty-eight years of age. 



98 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



while they had had much experience. In their minds they were planning 
and praying to know how to extend this work, in this direction and in 
the other. They were full of initiative, and yet I got just as much 
as they got. They got their board and clothes, what clothes were 
necessary, and I got the same. It was not given to them to possess that 
which was above me, and all were happy. We worked together and 
were like a happy family. It has been done; and with the tithing, 
as I say, and our fast offerings, expended for the benefit of the whole 
Church, we are ten per cent in the United Order. We should pay our 
tithes. Why could we not be twenty per cent, forty per cent, or all? 
Why couldn't I, I say again, if my family were cared for, work con- 
tinually, helping for the benefit of others ? 

REGARD FOR OTHERS 

Here is something more that was given to us January 2nd, 1831 
(Doctrine and Covenants, section thirty-eight) : 

"And let every man esteem his brother as himself — " That is pretty hard, 
I suppose, but there it is and it has been there for over a hundred years : 
— "and practice virtue and holiness before me. 

"And again I say unto you, let every man esteem his brother as himself. 

"For what man among you having twelve sons, and is no respecter of them, 
and they serve him obediently, and he saith unto the one : Be thou clothed in robes 
and sit thou here ; and to the other : Be thou clothed in rags and sit thou there — 
and looketh upon his sons and saith I am just? 

"Behold, this I have given unto you as a parable, and it is even as I am. 
I say unto you, be one ; and if ye are not one ye are not mine." 

SELFISHNESS MUST BE OVERCOME 

1 do not know, I haven't the wisdom to understand, how we can 
take people who are still so selfish that they cannot part with ten per 
cent and make them so that they will part with all, being assured that 
they will share equally with all. We ought not to ask anything better 
than that, if we have assurance of that. What, justice would there 
be in our asking for more than that? And that could be done. Just 
how to do it and when it will be done I do not know, but I do believe 
this that for many years past, for all the years past, I may say — J do 
not believe that while times were prosperous it would have been possible 
to organize the Saints into the United Order. If we did accept it, if 
we did go ahead and become powerful and great and rich I am sure 
it would be taken that we were a menace to the country, too powerful, 
too rich, too much of oneness. "And if ye are not one ye are not mine." 
Wjell, then, we were not his up to that point, and up to this point. 

IF CONDITIONS MEND 

But now, things are coming about so that we ask, What are we 
to do ? We are waiting until things mend. How can they do so unless 
the farmers and working people get money to spend? If we go on in 
the old way, if we go on producing just as we have produced, in mass 
production, and if our labor-saving machinery that has been invented 
for the blessing of mankind, and which should shorten the hours of 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. NIBLEY 



99 



labor, shorten the work of the laborer, goes on producing and producing 
just as it has in the past two or three years, we will be flooded again 
and will be in the same old condition. I do not see any other outcome, 
even if times change so that we can go on a little way with the hire and 
salary method, and begging for a job to work. In the phraseology of 
the streets, we are right up against it. We really don't know what to do. 

THE WAY OF THE LORD 

I have only time to quote from another revelation that the Lord 
has given on this same subject. (Section eighty-two of the Doctrine 
and Covenants) This was given in April, 1832 — one hundred years 
ago next April: 

"For Zion must increase in beauty, and in holiness; her borders must 
be enlarged; her stakes must be strengthened; yea, verily I say unto you, Zion 
must arise and put on her beautiful garments. 

"Therefore I give unto you this commandment, that ye bind yourselves by 
this covenant, and it shall be done according to the laws of the Lord. 

"Behold, here is wisdom also in me for your good. 

"And you are to be equal, or in other words, you are to have equal claims 
on the properties, for the benefit of managing the concerns of your stewardships, 
every man according to his wants and his needs, inasmuch as his wants are just — 

"And all this for the benefit of the church of the living God, that every 
man may improve upon his talent, that every man may gain other talents, 
yea, even an hundred fold, to be cast into the Lord's storehouse, to become 
the common property of the whole church — 

"Every man seeking the interest of his neighbor, and doing all things with 
an eye single to the glory of God. 

"This order I have appointed to be an everlasting order unto you, and unto 
your successors, inasmuch as you sin not." 

The Lord has provided a way out. People all over the world are 
groping for a way out. I do not know anything that quite equals 
this that was given a hundred years ago for the benefit of this Church 
and the revelations tell us that the center stake of Zion cannot be built 
up on any other principle. 

I see that my time has expired. The Lord bless you,, my brethren 
and sisters, you faithful workers in the cause of Christ. O, how my 
heart and soul go out to you ! You are the salt of the earth. The 
Church depends on you. God bless you. Amen. 

The Choir and congregation arose and sang the hymn, "God moves 
in a mysterious way." 

ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

I appreciate very much the honor and privilege of expressing 
my feelings on this auspicious occasion when many thousands of 
people are assembled and many thousands of others no doubt 
are listening in on the radio to the proceedings of this confer- 
ence. While I appreciate this opportunity T want to say that 



100 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



there is no other labor I have to perform in connection with my 
ministry that gives me so much anxiety and concern as that of an- 
ticipating a call to speak in the General Conferences of the Church. 
Notwithstanding the anxiety I have had I have enjoyed this conference 
exceedingly and I feel in my soul that it is one of the best we have 
ever had. 

I think that in considering the character of this vast audience 
I might conclude that there are present Latter-day Saints of every 
degree of faith and faithfulness, and others, good men and women, 
who have not identified themselves with the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints. I desire with all my heart to be able to say 
something that will be of interest and profit to my listeners, and to this 
end I trust that the Lord will help me to bring forth some of the 
reflections which I have had while sitting here upon the stand. 

"We believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated 
correctly; we also believe the Book of Mormon to be the word of God." 

This, without any qualification or apology. 

MORONl's EXHORTATION 

I want to read to you a few verses from the 10th chapter of the 
Book of Moroni in the Book of Mormon. It was Moroni who had 
the responsibility of hiding up in the Hill Cumorah, many centuries 
ago, the plates from which the Book of Mormon was translated ; and 
he had the responsibility of delivering those plates to Joseph Smith, and 
after they had been translated by the gift and power of God, received 
them back at the hands of the Prophet Joseph. 

Speaking of the time when this work should come forth he said : 

"Behold, I would exhort you that when ye shall read these things, if it 
be wisdom in God that ye should read them, that ye would remember how 
merciful the Lord hath been unto the children of men, from the creation of 
Adam even down until the time that ye shall receive these things, and ponder 
it in your heart. 

"And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would 
ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; 
and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent having faith in Christ, 
he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost. 

"And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things." 

THE REVEALED WORD OF GOD 

We read in the scriptures of the New Testament that "no prophecy 
of the scripture is of any private interpretation. For the prophecy 
came not in old time by the will of men : but holy men of God spake 
as they were moved by the Holy Ghost." 

The things contained in the Book of Mormon are the things of 
God given to the children of men by the inspiration and power of the 
Holy Ghost, and so are the things contained in the Doctrine and 
Covenants, in the Pearl of Great Price, and in the Holy Bible, which 
books constitute the standard works of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints. If we can enjoy that measure of the Holy Ghost 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 



101 



which was felt by and which actuated those prophets of God who spoke 
the things contained in these books, and wrote them, we will understand 
as they understood, and they will not be mysteries unto us. Every 
Latter-day Saint who is faithful, having accepted the first principles 
and ordinances of the Gospel, having had the Holy Ghost conferred 
upon him, if he is true to these things, will know the truth when he 
reads it or when he hears it spoken. 

MEN OF GOD 

When President Heber J. Grant stood up before the congregation 
in the first session of the conference and spoke, every true Latter-day 
Saint who heard him knew that he was and is the Lord's anointed, 
his mouthpiece and prophet to this people and to the world, as well as 
being the President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
I bear testimony to you that I know that he is God's recognized leader 
of this people and that he is guided by inspiration from on high — a 
humble man who seeks to know the will of the Lord in all matters 
pertaining to his work. I am grateful for the association I have had 
with President Grant and his counselors and with President Joseph 
F. Smith and those who were associated with him and are associated 
now in the leading councils of this Church. I know that they are 
prophets, seers and revelators in very deed. They are men of God, 
worthy the confidence and the following of this people, and if the people 
will follow them they will walk in paths which are straight and narrow 
and which lead to everlasting life. 

THE OFFICE OF THE HOLY GHOST 

By the power of the Holy Ghost which we through righteousness 
have a right to enjoy we know that all of those who have spoken in 
this conference in our hearing have spoken by the power of the Lord. 
They have spoken words of truth, and words which will make for 
salvation if we will receive them in good and honest hearts and live 
by them. This is the office of the Holy Ghost, who is a personage of 
spirit, one of the trinity of the Godhead. It is his mission and office 
to bear witness of the Father and of the Son and of the truth of all 
things. "No man may know that Jesus is the Lord except by the 
Holy Ghost." 

A MARVELOUS MANIFESTATION 

I want to say something about these other personages. I desire 
to call the attention of my hearers to an event which took place more 
than a century ago — to be more exact, in the spring of the year 1820 — 
when God the Eternal Father and his Son Jesus Christ, in answer 
to humble but fervent prayer on the part of the boy, Joseph Smith, 
whom they, had raised up for the ushering in of this Gospel Dispensation 
of the Fulness of Times, appeared to him in vision. I would call your 
attention to and have you visualize that wonderful manifestation, the 
greatest perhaps that ever did transpire. I know of no record or 



102 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



account of an occasion when both the Father and the Son have appeared 
to any individual at any previous time. I would call your attention to the 
importance and necessity of that wonderful revelation. You have 
but to consider today the lack of knowledge on the part of religionists 
the world over, pertaining to God the Father and his Son Jesus Christ 
and the Holy Ghost, to realize how necessary it was. 

OUR RESPONSIBILITY 

In 1820 it was just as necessary that this revelation should be 
given to the world as at any other time in the world's history, I am 
sure, and more needed because of the ushering in of the Dispen- 
sation of the Fulness of Times. We have had the revelation now 
for more than a century, and as members of the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints, which Church has been established by inspiration 
from the Lord through the instrumentality of the Prophet Joseph Smith 
and those who have succeeded him, we have accepted the Gospel and 
with it the responsibility of preaching it in all the world as a witness 
before the end comes. For a century we have tried to present this 
message to the world, that God the Father and his Son Jesus Christ 
have revealed themselves anew to man on the earth, and that the 
children of men need no longer be in spiritual darkness pertaining 
to the personality and the attributes of these heavenly beings and 
the relationship which we sustain to them. 

IMMORTAL BEINGS 

You know the story of the appearing of the Father and the Son 
to Joseph Smith. Think of it, as the Father and the Son stood there 
we see them as men, not as women, nor as angels, nor anything else. 
They stood in the midst of a light although it was at midday, brighter 
than the noonday sun, and their countenances shone with a glory that 
was beyond description, showing that they were ' something more than 
are we mortal men. And what are they? They are immortal beings. 
And what are immortal beings? Immortal beings are those who have 
passed through the change by which there is a separation of the body 
and the spirit, and then the resurrection, which is a uniting of the body 
and the spirit, so that there will be no more any separation. And this 
inseparable connection of body and spirit is necessary in order that one 
may obtain eternal life. In these heavenly personages we see two 
immortal beings, two beings who are glorified and exalted, and one 
of them is the Father, and the other the Son — there can be no question 
about that, because the personage speaking said to the boy, "This is my 
Beloved Son, hear him." 

(CONTRARY TO SECTARIAN BELIEF 

Now we come to the scriptures to find out if that is in keeping 
with the New Testament, and we find that it is. (Yet the whole Chris- 
tian world believe otherwise and have tried to disprove this for more 
than a century, but they have signally failed and they forever will 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 



103 



fail, for they cannot prove the truth a lie. The Gospel which we have 
received, with its principles and ordinances, is just as foreign to the 
views and ideas of the sectarian world as is the fact of the personality 
of God the Father, his Son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost, and yet 
it is scriptural and true. The belief that is almost universal is that 
God the Father and his Son Jesus Christ are not personages having 
bodies of flesh and bones, but that they are something having no body, 
no parts, no passions ; and that Jesus Christ has done for us all that 
is necessary to be done except to believe on him. I want to say that 
that is a grave and serious mistake. There has been a falling away 
from the true Gospel of the Master. Ordinances have been changed, 
the laws of the Gospel have been transgressed, the Everlasting (Cove- 
nant has been broken, as it has been predicted they would be. 

GOSPEL TRUTHS REVEALED ANEW 

The Lord has revealed anew the Gospel of Jesus Christ in its 
fulness, and it comprises faith in God the Eternal Father, in his Son, 
Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost. It includes repentance from 
sin and baptism by immersion in water by one having authority, for 
the remission of sins and the fulfilment of the law. It includes the 
laying on of hands by those in authority for confirmation to member- 
ship in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day faints and for the 
bestowal of the Holy Ghost. It includes other ordinances; and we 
have the holy priesthood. No man can under present rulings go 
into the temple to receive the ordinances there administered, above those 
of baptism and confirmation, without bearing the holy Melchizedek 
priesthood. And there are ordinances there administered which are 
absolutely necessary for those who would enter into the celestial^ king- 
dom, which makes the holding of and bearing worthily the Melchizedek 
priesthood, a conditinon necessary for any man to obtain a fulness of 
glory in the kingdom of God. 

Do the world understand that? They have not the priesthood; 
they have no power to receive it, only as they come into the fold of 
Christ and receive it at the hands of those who have authority to confer 
it. That priesthood is conferred upon those only who are proven to 
be worthy, if those who have the conferring of it follow instructions 
given and the established order of the Church of Christ. 

.MARRIAGE FOR ETERNITY 

There are other blessings and ordinances necessary to man's ex- 
altation, that the sectarian world know not of ; for instance, the eternity 
of the marriage covenant. Those who attain to a fulness of glory m the 
celestial kingdom are to have an eternal increase and a continuation 
of the seeds forever. It is unthinkable and untrue that that condition 
could exist without sustaining the marriage relation in the other world. 
But in order that men and women may live there as man and wite they 
must enter into most solemn covenants that they will be husband and 
wife for time and eternity, and there must be a solemn ceremony per- 



104 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



formed by one having authority, sealing them as husband and wife 
for time and eternity, and then they must live worthy otherwise to enter 
into the celestial kingdom. 

OTHER REQUIREMENTS 

There are commandments to be kept, laws to be obeyed, and there 
is service to be rendered. We have to engage in this work of preaching 
the Gospel abroad. We have to engage in the work of redeeming the 
dead. This is a service of the very highest type, like unto that which 
God our Father and his Son Jesus Christ rendered when the Father 
gave the Son, and the Son gave himself, to be the Redeemer and 
Savior of this world. Yes, and there are sins to be avoided. We are 
to learn to love the Lord our God with all our heart, might, mind 
and strength, and our neighbor as ourself, and manifest it in our life. 

Should we not be thankful, Latter-day Saints, for the light of 
the everlasting Gospel, and although it entails sacrifice, service, self 
denial, etc., we know that in the end our reward will be ample, even 
that of eternal life. 

I am grateful above all that I can express, for the understanding 
I have of the Gospel, and of the Father and of the Son and of the 
Holy Ghost, and the testimony I have of the truth. I praise God for 
these things. May he add his blessings, I pray in the name of Jesus 
Christ, Amen. 

ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 

Presiding Bishop of the Church 

I am happy, my brethren and sisters and friends, to associate with 
you at this time in this splendid conference and to partake of the spirit 
of this gathering. But I tremble" in the occupancy of this position. 

We have met together in this conference to consider matters 
pertaining to the welfare and progress not only of the Latter-day Saints, 
but of all mankind. The principles of this Gospel which we accept, and 
the practices which we endeavor to carry forward are, we consider, 
not only beneficial to us but to all the people of the earth. We realize 
that this Gospel has come to us as a free gift. That is, we have not 
organized it, but the Lord has established it, and we ihave been offered 
the opportunity to accept it and enjoy the benefits which come from 
obedience to it. I am sure that all that has been said in this conference 
is profitable to all men everywhere. 

LEADERSHIP OF MOSES 

I am reminded of the time when Moses had endeavored to lead 
the people of Israel out of Egypt into the promised land. After 
they had rejected his counsels and instruction, and the Lord had 
declared that they, as a people, should not enter into the promised land, 
they were kept in the wilderness until that generation had passed away, 
with one or two exceptions, and a new generation had grown up. 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 



105 



But under the leadership of Joshua they were permitted to go into the 
land of Canaan. After they had been in the land of Canaan and had 
subdued that country and had become established therein, many of 
them neglected the observance of the commandments of the Lord and 
fell away and were led into strange ways and to the worship of strange 
gods. 

CHOOSE WHOM YOU WILL SERVE 

We are told that shortly before his death Joshua called the people 
together and presented these matters to them. I should like to read 
to you briefly what he said : 

"Now therefore fear the Lord, 'and serve him in sincerity and in truth : 
and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the 
flood, and in Egypt; and serve ye the Lord. 

"And if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord, choose you this day whom 
ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the 
other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell : 
but as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord." 

FAITH IN GOD NEEDED 

It seems to me that if there ever was a time in the history of the 
world when faith in the living God was necessary it is the present 
time — faith which will produce works of righteousness ; faith which 
will enable men to live in accordance with the will of God and be 
able to walk in his paths; faithv which will cause them to desire to con- 
secrate themselves to the advancement of the purposes of the Lord. 
This will enable them also to cultivate the spirit of repentance, to realize 
from time to time, their shortcomings, their mistakes, and the things 
which they are doing contrary to the will of God, and to endeavor to 
overcome those things and thereby to develop in power, righteousness 
and truth. 

PURPOSE OF GOSPEL 

The Latter-day Saints believe that the Gospel comprehends the 
worship of the living God — the Father and the Son — as has been 
testified to by Brother Richards who has just spoken. We believe that 
this Gospel is intended for the welfare of all mankind. It will enable 
all who accept and live it to learn how to live together in unity in this 
life, and to prepare for eternity. It comprehends within itself those 
things which will help to promote not only the spiritual welfare of 
mankind, which is the most vital thing, but also their temporal progress. 

CONSIDERATION FOR OTHERS 

If this is the Gospel of Jesus Christ, what does it do for us? It 
helps us first to improve ourselves, to put our own lives in harmony 
with the principles which the Savior declared at the time when he was 
upon the earth, and which have been revealed anew in these days ; to 
live lives of fairness, of justice, of mercy, of sympathy and of right- 
eousness. It enables us also to cultivate greater consideration for our 



106 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



fellow men and desire for their progress and welfare. Likewise, it 
helps men to cultivate that spirit of repentance which is necessary in 
order to be able to overcome past mistakes, and to resist highmindedness, 
pride and selfishness. 

PRIESTHOOD FOR GUIDANCE 

So also is it important that all who have accepted this Gospel 
should be able to keep ourselves free from the worship of strange gods, 
that will interfere with our progress, whether it be that of wealth, the 
desire for excessive luxury, incorrect principles, or what not. The 
Church has within itself the power to aid greatly in the solution of 
temporal as well as spiritual problems that trouble mankind, because it 
has that inspired leadership which leads to truth — the basis of all real 
progress. In this connection you will realize that when Joshua spoke 
to the people of Israel he spoke as one who had been ordained to lead 
the people by the authority of the priesthood, which Moses had con- 
ferred upon him. So, in these days, we have those who are called to 
lead this people by the authority of the holy priesthood and hold the 
keys of the authority thereof. They labor in all humility and faith, 
and with a desire to serve the people as their servants, as was ex- 
pressed to us last night by President Nibley. 

DEMAND FOR A MODERN MOSES 

Recently, in a number of magazines and newspapers, articles have 
appeared calling for a modern Moses to lead the people out of the 
temporal depression which prevails throughout the world. When such 
a desire is expressed the question naturally arises whether the counsels 
of such a leader would be given any more attention than were those 
of that prophet by the people among whom he lived. Mankind is always 
much the same, except as it may be imbued with faith and the Spirit 
of God. You will remember that Moses himself - could not lead the 
people over whom he presided out of the wilderness, because they re- 
fused to accept his counsel, even though he spoke to them in the name 
of the Lord. They rejected him and, because of the rejection of the 
Lord through his servant, they failed to enter the promised land. But, 
in the thousands of years that have elapsed since the death of Moses, 
people have come to honor him as a prophet. As the Savior said, they 
honor the dead, but they stone the living prophets. It is probably 
natural for people to fail to accept the counsel of those who are in their 
midst — wise men, great men — who may be inspired to declare what is 
helpful and good for them. 

INSPIRED LEADERSHIP IN THE CHURCH 

The Latter-day Saints have been blessed in the leadership of men 
who have had wisdom and judgment. We believe not only in the 
teaching of spiritual things, but also of things that affect the temporal 
welfare of the Latter-day Saints and of mankind at large. The Lord 
has inspired his servants who lead this people, to declare the things that 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 



107 



are good for them in the midst of this prevailing depression. I would 
like to recite to you some of the things that have been said by the 
leaders of this Church today, yesterday, the day before, and for a long 
time past, which affect the welfare not only of this people but of all 
mankind for good; and would have helped them to relieve themselves 
of much of the trouble that prevails today, if they had accepted and lived 
in accordance with these things. When I say these things I speak to 
myself as well as to you. 

Here are some of the things which I desire to call briefly to your 
attention because I think they are important. They are counsels that 
have been given us that would save us from trouble, distress and tribu- 
lation : 

Live within your Income : It is the only way to progress, peace and 
prosperity. President Brigham Young declared : 

"Learn to do without that which you cannot purchase and pay for; and 
bring your minds into subjection that you must and will live within your means." 

Cultivate Thrift: It is just as important for us to realize that we 
should save out of that which we earn for times of trouble and distress 
as it was for Egypt in the time of Joseph to save during the seven 
years of prosperity and of growing crops, for the seven years of famine 
and distress that would come after them, ft has been said that capital 
represents the savings of civilization. We should put aside our savings 
in the form of cash and place those savings where they will be taken 
care of and where they will be secure. That requires wisdom and 
judgment. 

Get out of Debt : We were told that last evening by President Ivins, 
and we have been counseled to this effect repeatedly in the past. How 
many of us have accepted that advice? All of us would be far better 
off if we had accepted it and observed it. 

Avoid Speculation : One of the important causes of the present de- 
pression and of every other panic is excessive speculation during pros- 
perous times. In 1929 the fever of speculation spread everywhere. 
It has been said that periods of prosperity and of hard times will recur 
as long as the agencies of production and exchange are strained to the 
limit to meet demands stimulated to extravagance by a universal passion 
of speculation. 

Pay as You Go : We have been counseled again and again not to 
mortgage our futures. We should not be misled by those high pressure 
salesmen who will sell us continually on the promise of our being able 
to pay during our lifetime. Shall we profit by such counsel in the 
future ? 

Patronise Home Industry: We heard the counsel from President 
Grant last evening to support local industries, and we have heard it 
repeatedly from many other leaders of the Church. As stated by him, 
thousands, in fact I have been told by the Manufacturers' Association 



108 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



that in this State alone twenty thousand men and women, could be 
employed in addition to those already employed, if the people of this 
State were to buy the products that are manufactured here. In these 
intermountain states particularly greater encouragement and patronage 
of home manufactures on the part of people who live here are neces- 
sary for our mutual welfare, because we are not so favorably situated as 
the coast cities and others advantageously located for transportation 
rates and markets. But we have the raw materials, and it seems to 
me there should be nothing go out of this intermountain country 
as far as it is possible to avoid that is not in manufactured form. There 
should be no good reason why the price and quality of all our products 
should not favorably compete with others. 

Watch your Markets — Avoid Over-production: The people have 
been advised by Church leaders to study market conditions and to 
avoid excessive production, whether in farm products or in prepared 
commodities. Agriculturists have been urged to diversify, and to 
produce for their own requirements as far as possible. President 
Brigham Young told the people : "Learn to sustain yourselves. Produce 
everything you need to eat, drink or wear." Industries have been 
encouraged to cater particularly to nearby markets. One of the most 
powerful causes of the trouble that exists today is because of the 
difference between production and consumption. It has been declared 
that prosperity is a state of equilibrium between production and con- 
sumption. 

Overcome Selfishness — Avoid Greed : This counsel applies less to 
the Latter-day Saints probably than to any other group. But the 
prevalence of selfishness and greed among mankind has contributed 
greatly to the present situation. The free operation of economic laws 
is interfered with by selfish human interests. It has been said that the 
fundamental cause of unrighteousness is the desire for power and for 
wealth, coupled with the character and purpose of that desire. 

OVERCOME PAST MISTAKES 

My brethren and sisters, if we as a people had in past years ob- 
served these instructions, referred to here very briefly, we should 
hardly have noticed the depression. It would scarcely affect us, cer- 
tainly not nearly to the extent that it has done up to the present time. 
If we will learn from our mistakes and repent of our shortsightedness 
and our failure to observe the counsel and advice of these men who 
stand here to lead and guide us, we shall profit in the future. And if 
the people of this nation and the world would generally observe these 
instructions which have been given from time to time by the inspired 
leaders of the Church, all would be far better off and there would not 
be suffering nearly to the same extent as that which has occurred. 
Neglect to follow such rules has contributed very largely to produce 
the present unfavorable conditions.

CRITICAL ATTITUDE CAUSED BY ADVERSITY 

A critical attitude is prevalent at present throughout the earth 
with relation to existing conditions. Such an attitude is probably to be 
expected because of the adverse circumstances and the suffering that 
many people are going through for lack even of the necessities of life. 
They are almost desperate. It is, of course, very important that every- 
thing possible should be done through cooperation, by donations and 
every other available means to prevent suffering and assure at least the 
necessities of life for people everywhere. It is vital, also, that everyone, 
as far as possible, shall be given opportunity to work. 

PANACEAS SUGGESTED 

Many panaceas have been suggested to avoid the recurrence of 
such conditions as prevail at present. Some are constructive ; others are 
destructive. Some proposals are altruistic in nature ; others are utterly 
selfish. There are those who would forcibly and unlawfully take the 
property of others in violation of the rights guaranteed to all citizens 
under the Constitution. Naturally, the representatives of the people 
in Congress can, with the approval of the President, proceed to change 
the laws wherever necessary to protect the citizens as a whole from 
improper aggrandizement of property by a few, and to promote the 
general welfare. You cannot legislate righteousness into people, but 
you can and should bring about, through the law-enforcing agencies 
general respect for and observance of law. 

ALL THINGS IN COMMON 

There are others who advocate the principle of having all things 
in common. That is a very fine doctrine. Any group that can subscribe 
to it wholeheartedly, labor unitedly, wisely and diligently for the wel- 
fare of the whole, and maintain loyalty, altruism and kindliness con- 
stantly, can doubtless succeed in developing a splendid community. But 
it requires all of these qualities. There needs to be entire banishment 
of envy and greed from the hearts of those who would undertake it. How 
many are able to maintain the unselfishness necessary to bring about 
such a desirable condition? 

Then, there is the doctrine of communism, which is more extreme. 
Under such a system the properties of others might be forcibly taken 
for its adherents, and control exercised in all matters pertaining to 
labor, religion, and social relations. Some English writer, in a satirical 
mood, has given the following definition of communism in the extreme : 

"What is a communist? One |who has yearnings 
For an equal division of unequal earnings ; 
Sluggard or scoundrel, or both, he is willing 
To fork out his penny and pocket your shilling." 

Such a description may not apply to many people, but it does apply 
to some who are selfish and covetous in their desires, and are not 
willing to do their part in helping to earn and to promote the welfare of 
the entire community. 



110 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



CHURCH STANDS FOR GREATER EQUALITY 

It is desirable, as stated by President Nibley this morning, that, 
there should be greater equality of wealth, and greater consideration 
on the part of those who have means in giving for the benefit of 
those who are not so favorably situated. Consideration by men 
for their fellows must be ingrained in them by some power other 
than politics, and that must, apparently, be through religion. The 
Gospel of Jesus Christ as taught and practiced by this people is, in my 
judgment, the most effective means ior the promotion of greater 
mutual interest. The Church stands for greater equality and coopera- 
tion among mankind, without in any way interfering with individual 
initiative. Any legislation that will help to promote the mutual welfare 
of all, and control the aggrandizement of wealth is, in my judgment, 
fully justified. Faithful Church members show continually their con- 
sideration for others by the spirit of brotherly kindness, and by ma- 
terial contributions for the temporal and spiritual welfare of their 
fellows. 

GOSPEL PROMOTES SPIRIT OF CONSECRATION 

The teachings of "Mormonism" are and always have been of such 
character as to stimulate in those who accept them the spirit of con- 
secration of their time, means and efforts to the welfare of others 
as well as themselves. The observance of the principle of tithing, of fast- 
ing and fast offerings, relief of those in need, the missionary work, 
community building, all help to promote, through service to the Lord, 
the interests of our fellow members. 

OBEY THE LAW OF TITHING 

We have been continually encouraged to obey the law of tithing. 
It is a most effective test of our faith in God and his work. It helps 
to raise us to higher standards. It is a means for our temporal as well 
as our spiritual progress. Obedience to this law will aid us to conserve 
our pfoperty and to develop prudence and foresight in our affairs. 
The prophet Malachi declared anciently that if the Hebrews would 
observe this principle faithfully they should be materially blessed and 
the Lord would rebuke the devourer for their sakes. 

If we accept the principle of tithing in a half-hearted way, fearing 
that we are going to give too much or are making too great a sacrifice, 
we shall not enjoy the blessings which the Lord has promised. But 
if we give liberally in the spirit of that principle we shall be blessed. 
President Brigham Young declared on one occasion : "I would not give 
the ashes of a rye straw for the man who feels that he is making 
sacrifice for God. We are doing this for our own happiness, welfare 
and exaltation, and Inobody's else." Every principle of the Gospel is 
a privilege for us. It is a means for our growth and development, and 
if we shall observe it we shall enjoy the blessings that follow. ■ 

CULTIVATE CONTRITENESS OF SPIRIT 

My brethren and sisters, I think we should accept and observe 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 



111 



the counsels that are given to us by the Presidency of the Church and 
the other leaders who are inspired of God. In the spirit of humility 
we should cultivate the faith and repentance which is necessary in 
order that we may walk uprightly and in accordance with the will of 
the Lord. I am reminded of a statement in the Book of Mormon where 
the voice of the Lord declared unto the people : "Ye shall offer for a 
sacrifice unto me a broken heart and a contrite spirit." And Kipling 
in that wonderful poem, "The Recessional," after the great celebration 
in England at the time of the jubilee of Queen Victoria, reminded the 
people : _ 

"Still stands thine ancient sacrifice, 
An humble and a contrite heart . . . 
Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet, 
Lest we forget, — lest we forget." 

May the Lord help each of us firmly to resolve in our hearts and 
minds that "as for me and my house we will serve the Lord," I pray 
in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

The Choir sang the anthem, "Jesus Only." 

Elder Milton H. Welling offered the closing prayer. 

Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock p. m. 

THIRD DAY 

AFTERNOON MEETING 

The closing session of the Conference commenced promptly at 
2 o'clock, Sunday afternoon, October 4, 1931, the attendance being sim- 
ilar to that at the previous meeting. 

President Heber J. Grant presided. 

The Tabernacle Choir and congregation sang the hymn, "The Spirit 
of God like a fire is burning." 

Elder Thomas E. McKay, President of the Ogden Stake, offered the 
opening prayer. 

President Grant announced that the beautiful flowers on the stand 
in front of the great organ had been sent in honor of Brother Evan 
Stephens, who led the Choir for the last time one year ago, he having 
since passed away. He further announced that the Choir would now 
sing the anthem, "God of Israel," which anthem Brother Stephens con- 
sidered one of his best compositions. 

The Choir then sang "God of Israel." 

ELDER REED SMOOT 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

In the first place, my brethren and sisters, I want to offer my 
sincere thanks and gratitude to ,my Heavenly Father for the privilege 
I have of attending this wonderful conference. I have never attended 
one in my life where I have felt the Spirit of the living God so strongly. 



112 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



BLESSINGS THROUGH ATTENDING CONFERENCES 

I cannot understand how any person could attend services such 
as we have had during this conference without feeling at least that 
God was directing and his Spirit was present at every session. 

It is indeed a privilege to attend these semi-annual conferences, 
and it is also a privilege to attend the conferences in the different 
stakes of Zion. My duties as a senator of the United States have 
prevented me from attending many of them. Since the war my calling 
has kept me in Washington most of the time and I have had the 
privilege only a few times of attending these conferences. 

Last night I saw in this building every seat taken by men holding 
the priesthood. It was a wonderful sight, and the instructions and the 
spirit present impressed me as I never was impressed before with the 
duties that devolve upon the men holding the priesthood. I also felt 
the response that was made at that gathering last night. I could feel 
it in every word that was spoken and the expressions that followed. 
I could see that they touched the hearts of the men holding the holy 
priesthood in this Church, in a way that the labors in the different stakes 
from which they come would be carried on with a great deal more 
energy and confidence than they have been in the past. 

TESTIMONY THROUGH PRAYER 

My mother taught me that the way to receive a testimony of this 
work, and the way to maintain it, is to never cease praying; and she 
promised me as my mother that if I would follow that course I should 
always have a knowledge that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, 
and that this work is his work. Brethren and sisters, I have followed 
that counsel, and notwithstanding the positions to which I have been 
called that have taken me away from the body of the people, not- 
withstanding the year before that happened my avocation called me 
to meet men who actually ridiculed our belief and the question of 
God ever revealing himself to man, as being unreasonable and in- 
defensible, thank God I have lived through it all. I thank God for 
the testimony I have that this is his work and that every prediction 
made by any servant of God in relation to it shall be fulfilled. 

As I see conditions in the world today and contemplate them I 
know that if the great principles as taught by the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints were universal in the world no such 
conditions would ever exist. 

I pray God to "give me clean hands, clean words, and clean 
thoughts. Save me from habits that harm. Teach me to work as 
hard and play as fair in thy sight alone as if all the world saw. 
Forgive me when I am unkind, and help me to forgive those who are 
unkind to me. Keep me ready to serve others at some cost to myself. 
Send me chances to do a little good every day, and so grow more 
like Christ." 

If we all lived strictly to the laws of the Church and the require- 



ELDER REED SMOOT 113 



ments of the Church that prayer would be answered by everyone who 
offered it. There are no people in the world that I know of who are 
better capable and more willing and whose numbers are such that the 
worthy poor among them can be better cared for. 

CONDITIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD 

We have had pictures today of conditions existing, not half so 
bad as they are in the balance of the world. God knows what will 
come out of it, but I believe with all my soul that the times people 
are passing through today, not only in our own country but in the 
countries of the world, will cause them to turn their thoughts to a 
supreme power, the Creator of the world, the God we worship. 

NOT A PRAYING NATION 

I am afraid that our America is not a praying nation. I do not 
believe that there is a people on earth, compared by percentages, that 
pray to God every morning and night such as do the people of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Wherever I go, outside 
of the families of the Church and the conferences that I attend in 
different places in which the Church gathers, there are few places 
where prayer is offered. And sometimes when I hear prayer in other 
places it is like a tinkling cymbal and sounding brass. It goes in one 
ear and out of the other. No power whatever is back of it. It is mere 
words and nothing else. 

IN CONGRESSIONAL ASSEMBLIES 

I am thankful to my Heavenly Father that the Senate of the 
United States and the House of Representatives never begin a session 
without the offering of prayer. As I read history I find that when the 
first session of our Congress was held, which was in Carpenter's Hall, 
Philadelphia, September 5th, 1774, the question then arose as to 
whether it was proper to open that session with prayer. Thank the 
Lord there was a majority present who had shortly before passed 
through the horror of war. I think it was perhaps for that reason 
there was a decision made that every session of the Senate should 
be opened by prayer. That has continued down to the present time, 
and I notice, as I have said, that a majority were in favor of it. They 
were such men as George Washington, Patrick Henry, John Rutledge, 
Colonel Fulton, Peyton Randolph, Richard Henry Lee, John James, 
Isaac Law. I am not going to give the names of those who opposed it. 
The question arose as to whether they should kneel or whether they 
should stand. My brethren and sisters, I am thankful to my Heavenly 
Father that that practice has existed down to this day, and it would 
be a Godless nation if that were not followed. I am sure that the 
spirit that is asked for many times in the opening prayer is not made 
manifest a few minutes after the word "amen" is said. But yet it 
has its influence and I hope and trust that this shall never be a Godless 
nation. 



114 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



NOT IN UNCLEAN TABERNACLES 

I suppose you all know that I am a firm believer in the Word of 
Wisdom. I have lived it all my life, thanks to the mother who gave 
me birth. I know, my brethren and sisters, that he who does not 
abide by that law, he or she who robs his or her mind of good judg- 
ment by the use of intoxicating liquor cannot enjoy the Spirit of 
God. The Spirit of God never will live in an unclean tabernacle. 
You cannot tell me that a man — and I am sorry to have to say, 'as it 
has been quite prevalent in the world, or a woman — who imbibes the 
damnable stuff can have the companionship of the Spirit of God. 

There is no people, according to the numbers, that obey this law 
as well as do the Latter-day Saints. But I want to say that we are 
far from perfect, in fact I have witnessed since I have been home 
members of the Church who have forgotten themselves in this regard. 
The prophetic spirit was with Joseph ,|Smith a century ago when the 
Lord announced through him his calling, because of "the calamity 
which should come upon the inhabitants of the earth," and which has 
come and is coming in our day. The "spirit of prophecy," which is "the 
testimony of Jesus," also was with him when the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints was brought into existence. It brought 
not a new religion, but a restatement of the old, with its divine au- 
thority, gifts and blessings, "the power of God unto salvation." 

MORE GODLINESS OR MORE GODLESSNESS? 

And now, what are we Latter-day Saints going to do about 
it? Shall we awaken to a renewed effort to learn the word of God? 
Shall we teach our young men and young women more of godliness 
through actual, intimate knowledge of the scriptures, and less of the 
godlessness that comes through men's self-glorification in a presumed 
knowledge which really is not actual knowledge, but which holds the 
domain of speculation and skepticism? Shall we cling more closely 
than ever to God-given facts, whether in doctrine, in prophecy or in 
history? On our reply in practical service depends our own salvation 
and the salvation of many to whom our precept and example shall 
come. 

THE SPIRITUAL FACTOR 

Of the religious aspect, Sir Hubert Barker writes in the London 
Daily Mail : "The spiritual benightedness of modern men is the 
paramount evil of our age. Man must advance more swiftly on his 
spiritual side. It is always the spiritual factor that determines man's 
destiny. If the churches have become a by-word with thinking men, 
it is because they have turned from religion to ecclesiasticism." 

The wise man said, Proverbs fourth chapter, seventh verse : 
"With all thy getting get understanding." My suggestion to those 
who would be instructors is that they lead their students to "get 
understanding;" otherwise there comes misunderstanding and unbelief. 

Another feature to which our present attention may be called is 



ELDER REED SMOOT 



115 



that the prevailing atheistic instruction which permeates our universities, 
and our schools, and our social and other clubs, is the chief direct and 
potent cause of the great crime wave of which we hear and see so 
much in public discussions today. ' Israel's great Psalmist has said 
(Psalms 14:1 and 53:1): "The fool hath said in his heart, There is 
no God. They are corrupt and have done abominable works." 

The criminals in our land today pursue their vocation in the 
thought that there is no God. The gangster that sometimes takes charge 
of things in our great cities and makes the police force seem pitiably 
helpless, has his chief potency in the thought that there is no God. 
He may be caught, serve in prison, but when released goes on in his 
career of crime. When protested with, he says : "What difference 
does it make? No one can touch me until I am caught at it. And 
I don't expect to be caught again." His thought clearly indicates 
by both word and act that there is no God. 

It is the mission of the Latter-day Saints, in their Church designa- 
tion, that by thought and word and action they testify to the world 
that there is a God who is mindful of his children if they will but heed 
his word. Where God lives in the souls and minds of men there is 
peace and righteousness ; but otherwise not. 

My brethren and sisters, God bless us. God prepare his Church 
and those who are directing the affairs of it that it shall fulfil the 
destiny that he has in store for it, whether it comes in this decade 
or in decades to come. It is the duty, and I may say the pleasure, of 
God's people to bring into the world the light, the life, the teachings of 
the Master, Jesus Christ. This I pray for, in the name of Jesus Christ, 
Amen. 

ELDER NOAH S. POND 

Former President of the Northern States Mission 

My brethren and sisters, I think of all the surprises that have 
come to me, this is the greatest one. I have rejoiced exceedingly 
in what it has been my privilege to hear in the sessions of this con- 
ference. 

I am deeply grateful for the blessing that came to me of presiding 
over the Northern States mission, and I have earnestly desired that I 
should come home and be as happily engaged in the service of the 
Lord in the future as I have been in the past. Sister Pond and our 
sons have likewise enjoyed the blessings of our missionary experiences, 
in the growth of Relief Society and other activities." 

I can but briefly refer to and give you a faint impression of the 
feelings that fill the heart of one laboring in the ministry. I know, 
my brethren and sisters, that all of us at home are missionaries. 
Responsibility in the Church, membership in the Church, the accept- 
ance of responsibility in the priesthood, constitute us missionaries. 
But until we go out into the world we do not have a full realization 
of the importance of our testimonies. 



116 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



It has been my privilege to stand where the prophets of God 
have stood. I have been in those memorable cities where the Prophet 
Joseph, Brigham Young, Sidney Rigdon, Oliver Cowdery, Orson Pratt, 
Parley P. Pratt and others of our fine leaders in the early history 
of the Church have ministered. I have stood where President John 
Taylor stood when he organized the first branch of the Church, nearly 
a hundred years ago, in the city of Indianapolis, Indiana, and I thought 
I could actually feel the spirit of that prophet of God. I remember 
when that Sabbath occurred. I had referred to the history of the 
Church for verification of time and place and to know that it was 
true to history. 

Early in this past year when Justice Holmes of the United States 
Supreme Court, approaching the ninetieth year of his mortal life, 
rendered one of the decisions of the Supreme Court, indicative of the 
power of his mentality, and the statement was flashed over the country 
that he bore in his body the bullets that were fired into it by Con- 
federate soldiers, I thought : Well, even this remarkable incident is 
paralleled in the history of our Church. Like Justice Holmes, Presi- 
dent John Taylor, when he organized that branch in Indianapolis, 
carried within his body the bullets that the assassins had fired into it, 
and that grand President of the Church carried those assassins' bullets 
in his body to the grave, and died in exile. A beautiful chapel now 
stands in Indianapolis where President Taylor organized the first branch. 
Likewise five other chapels have been erected during the past three and 
one-half years in Detroit, Columbus, Cincinnati, Dayton and Chicago. 

I have seen the sons and daughters, grandsons and granddaughters 
of those leaders of the Church following in the footsteps of their 
worthy ancestors and preaching as honestly and as sincerely the prin- 
ciples of the Gospel as they were preached fifty, seventy-five or eighty 
years ago. I have stood at the doorsteps of the homes of our leaders, 
Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, Lorenzo Snow, John Taylor, the 
P'ratts, the Snows — those brick houses are standing or falling into 
decay, but they are mute and silent testimonies of the substantial 
solidarity of the building of our people, even the homes that they in- 
habited. And those memorable cities of Nauvoo, Illinois, and Kirtland, 
Ohio, where the Saints erected temples in the name and honor of 
God, have greatly degenerated. I never could have believed that the 
hand of God would be manifested so powerfully, so positively upon 
such spots, people, sections and localities, as 1 have seen in these, the 
deadest spots in all the world — Kirtland, Ohio, and Nauvoo, Illinois — 
where temples of God were raised in this century of the existence 
of our Church and which were so glorious in the beginning of our 
history. 

I bear you my humble testimony, and pray our father's blessings 
upon his servants. They are as true and as fine in their prophetic 
calling and leadership today as were those who were called at the 
inception of the Church. This is my testimony of the divinity of the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ, in the name of our Savior and Master, Amen. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



117 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I have called for several of the returned mission presidents a 
number of times, to come to the stand and speak to us, but they 
have not been present. I shall not call out again the names of those 
who have not yet spoken here for fear they are not present. But 
I would like that at any time any one of the returned mission 
presidents is in conference, who has not had the opportunity of 
bearing his testimony, ,he would notify me so that he will not be 
overlooked. With the exception of two we have now heard from 
all returned mission presidents. 

ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

I have selected a text. This is not usual with me, but the 
experiences of this conference have been such that I would like to 
refer to it if I am so led. ,1 feel very humble to stand in the pres- 
ence of this great audience and very much do I desire an interest 
in your faith and prayers, .that the delightful influences that have 
pervaded our conference, and the inspiration of the Lord that has 
been upon those who have addressed us may be with me. 

ABSENT ONES 

These beautiful flowers are the offering of Sister Sarah 
Daniels, the good woman who kept house for Evan Stephens for 
years prior to his demise. They were brought by her in remem- 
brance of Brother Stephens who directed the Choir in our confer- 
ence a year ago. 

I ;have been lonesome during this conference for some of the 
absent brethren who were here six months ago. Since then Elders 
Orson F. Whitney and Rey L. Pratt have passed to the Great 
Beyond. They were two of the beloved leaders in Israel and no- 
body can take their places. Elders John A. ,Widtsoe and Joseph 
W. McMurrin are also absent in the mission field rendering service. 

LOVE FOR THE BRETHREN 

My heart is tender today and my feelings are subdued as I 
realize -the bounteous blessings of the Lord bestowed upon me and 
mine. It is a priceless privilege to live in an atmosphere such as 
we enjoy in this Church and to associate witli good men and women 
who are interested in benefiting all mankind. The companionship 
of the leaders of Israel is to me a blessing, the value of which can- 
not be measured. These leaders on this stand are representatives 
of our Heavenly Father and I love them as if they were my own 
flesh and blood. 

As I associate with the General Authorities, stake presidents, 
high councilors, bishops, and the leaders in the various depart- 
ments of the Church, from the depths of my soul I feel grateful for 



118 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



the opportunity that has been mine in life, to have as my compan- 
ions the kindest, holiest and best men and women that this world 
knows anything about. 

In I. John, 3rd Chapter and 14th Verse we read : 

"We know that we have 'passed from death unto life, because we love the 
brethren." 

What a wonderful thing it is to belong to an organization that 
teaches that very thing, and not only teaches it by word of mouth, 
but exemplifies it in so many marvelous ways. How grateful we 
should be to our Heavenly Father that .those with whom we are 
permitted to associate are dependable, and that we can love them 
and have their companionship. 

TEACHING THE WORLD 

A number of years ago I was riding with a man in the East. 
I told him where I was from, that I was a member of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and he asked : "Is that church 
still in existence in Utah?" I replied, "Yes, and growing rapidly." 
I thought then: Will it ever be possible for us to convince the world 
that this is the Lord's work ? Although it .encounters many ob- 
stacles it goes forward constantly. It would seem an impossible 
task to personally contact and teach the Gospel to all people, but 
with the radio countless thousands, many ,of them living far away, 
may hear the servants of the Lord teach the truth. I was recently 
in Winnipeg, Canada, and was there told .that some of the finest 
programs they hear are those from Salt Lake City. Often they 
tune in on KSL and hear the sermons that are delivered on Sunday 
evening. In every case of that kind people have spoken appreci- 
atively of what they are permitted to enjoy. 

We are living in a marvelous age, at a time when the Lord has 
not only inspired his children to do wonderful things to make our 
existence more pleasant here, but has revealed his Gospel anew 
and established his Church to prepare us for the celestial kingdom. 
It ,is difficult to bring people to an understanding of the fact that 
this Gospel is not the work of man, but is our Father's work, given 
to us in this latter day for the blessing of all mankind. 

INTEREST IN THE CHURCH GROWING 

During the year I have visited four of the mission fields of the 
United [States, /three of them from one end to the other, and in ; 
every mission I have found delightful people who are interested in 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 

In the Texas mission one young man, who was the religious 
editor of a newspaper, came to our meetings, and then asked if he 
might come to the hotel and talk with us. We visited with him. 
That is less than a year ago now, and only within the last two or 
three days I have learned that he has joined the Church because 
of the blessing that he feels will come to him by such a membership.

In some places I found that our chapels are not large enough 
to hold the conference congregations. In several cities people 
came in such numbers that we could not make them comfortable, 
and the audiences, in many cases, were composed mostly of those 
who are not members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints. 

The work of the Lord is going forward. The teachings of our 
Redeemer are finding a lodgment in the hearts of the children of 
men. The spirit of prayer is abroad, and I would like to say that 
it is pleasing to me, as I go into the homes of non-members, to find 
that many are anxious to approach the Lord in prayer, and the 
servants of the Lord are asked to pray with them, showing their 
faith in the power and blessing of prayer. But it seems strange 
that it is so difficult for many people to understand the plan of 
salvation. 

TEACHINGS OF THE REDEEMER - 

The discourses that have been delivered from this stand during 
this conference have been delightful to me. Nothing has been said 
that anybody could take exception to or that anyone would not 
be pleased to accept. What ,has been said has been in conformity 
to the teachings of Jesus Christ our Lord. We believe in faith, in 
repentance, in baptism by immersion for the remission ,of sins and 
the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost. These are 
the teachings of the Redeemer of mankind, and he has called upon 
us in this latter day to teach all people these glorious truths and 
others that have been revealed. 

When ,1 visit the sons and daughters of the Latter-day Saints in 
the mission field, and discover how they grow in strength and 
power and in grace before the Lord, and how they are able in their 
humble ,way to explain the principles of the Gospel to_ the con- 
vincing of many of our Father's children, I am thankful indeed. I 
wonder if the Latter-day Saints really appreciate what a contribu- 
tion they are offering ,to the world when they send out these young 
men, and in many cases young women, who are giving their time 
and such information as they possess in order that others may 
enjoy the blessings of which we partake. 

ALL CANNOT UNDERSTAND 

The scriptures inform us that all will not understand the 
Gospel. (See I Cor. 1:18.) 

"For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness ; but ,irnto 
us which are saved it is the power of God." 

Is that not true? Has your missionary experience not brought 
to you that realization, as it did to Paul, that those who refuse 
the truth are on the way to perishing? They do not comprehend, 
and the Gospel of Jesus Christ is but foolishness unto them Many 
are good men and good women, but they cannot understand. To 



120 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



you who have been baptized into his Church and have been obedi- 
ent to his requirements the Gospel of Jesus Christ is an anchor and 
brings to you a satisfaction that can come in no other way. 

ANXIOUS TO DIVIDE WITH OTHERS 

As I read the scriptures, not only the Old and the New Testa- 
ments, but the >Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and 
the Pearl of Great Price, I marvel at the goodness of the Lord to 
bless those who accept his teachings, for we find more comfort in 
these sacred records than in all the philosophies of the ages, as 
given to us by the wisdom of men. 

Standing here as one of the weakest and humblest among you, 
I feel to praise my Heavenly Father for the testimony that he has 
given to me ithat this is his Church. Oh, how I wish that the good 
people of all denominations might really know what we are seeking 
to divide with them ! I meet members of the Catholic, the Pres- 
byterian, the Baptist, the Methodist, and all the other churches, and 
I find in these men and women virtues that are most beautiful to 
me. But I find that they are so rooted in the organizations 'with 
which they are identified that when I try to explain to them what 
we are doing, they seem mystified ; they are not able to understand. 
One man said to me, "Would you have us give up all that we have 
had, all these blessings that we have enjoyed, to join your church?" 
I replied : "Not a blessing, not one good thing would we ask you 
to give up. But we do say to you, we will be glad to divide with 
you, if you will permit us so to do, without cost to you, some of the 
blessings of our Heavenly Father that have been kept from you in 
the past which are now at your very door." 

It is not the purpose of this Church to make statements that 
would hurt the feelings of those who do not understand things. 
This Church is not one that goes about criticising and finding fault 
with others, but in the spirit of loving kindness and the desire to 
be helpful, its representatives carry the Gospel message to the na- 
tions of the earth. This unusual missionary service is attracting 
world-wide attention. By the thousands the sons of God, bearing 
the priesthood, and some of his daughters, have gone to the utter- 
most corners of the earth, paying their own .expenses, for the pur- 
pose of sharing with our Father's children his precious truths which 
would be so helpful to them if they would but accept them -and 
make them part of their lives. 

THE WISDOM OF THE WISE 

The scripture that I last read is followed by this : 

"For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and ,will bring to 
nothing the understanding of the prudent." 

And in another place we read : 

"The wisdom of /their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their 
prudent men shall be hid." 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 121 



In analyzing the distressed condition of the world at the pres- 
ent time and realizing that the greatest minds of all lands in study- 
ing our problems are utterly helpless to meet the issue, I am per- 
suaded that until they turn to him whose children they are and 
acknowledge the Father who is so anxious to bless, until they will 
give him an opportunity to inspire them, they will continue !to 
grope in uncertainty \and fail to solve the problems that afflict 
mankind. The difficulties for which we are now seeking remedies 
are the result of forsaking the teachings of the Lord and depending 
upon the wisdom of men. 

THE PANACEA 

If I were to voice what is in my heart it would seem egotistical 
to some, but I say to all men everywhere, examine the teachings 
of the Gospel of our Lord as revealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith, 
search them prayerfully, and you shall find the panacea for the ills 
of this world, and it will be discovered in no other way. 

I believe that, as I ibelieve that I live, and when I speak thus it 
is with the fervent desire that in some way we may be able to in- 
terest our Father's children and bring them to an understanding of 
his truth, that the errors and mistakes of mankind may be neutral- 
ized, that the power of evil may be turned aside, and that his chil- 
dren everywhere may be induced to glorify his name. 

OUR DUTY 

Think of the great and good men who have taught the Gospel 
of Jesus Christ, from the days of Joseph Smith until the present 
time, and how often their words have fallen upon dull ears through- 
out the world. I realize that the time is coming, however, and our 
Heavenly Father has so decreed, that all shall know. But in the 
meantime, it is your duty and mine, not only to teach the truth 
but to let our light so shine, by our conduct in life, that others,' 
observing our good works, may be constrained to glorify his name. 

It is your duty and mine, as we go to and fro among our com- 
panions day by day, to radiate such an influence that they will 
be led to investigate the cause of the peace and happiness that 
dwells with those who serve God and keep his commandments. It 
is not necessary that we be called upon missions for that. Right here 
at home and in all nations there are hundreds and thousands of 
good men and women who are not yet touched by the Gospel -of 
Jesus Christ, many of whom did they but understand what you 
understand, would be glad to conform to the requirements of our 
Heavenly Father and partake of his blessings. If in our homes and 
in our business affairs, if in our lives everywhere, we will go about 
radiating that love that should be in every heart, that kindness that 
should possess every Latter-day Saint, (and particularly in these 
times when condittions are so serious for many) many men and 
many women will rise up to call us blessed, not only for the 
creature comforts that we may bestow, but because of the hope of 



122 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



eternal life that we have been the instruments in the hands of God 
of placing before them in a comprehensive way. 

Some of the greatest mission fields in all the world are the 
abiding places of the Latter-day Saints, the towns and villages 
where we live, and if we would but do what our Father desires us 
to do, the beauty of the Gospel of our Redeemer would be realized 
by ;the children of men, and we would all be made happier to see our 
Father's children — every one of them dear to him and precious in 
his sight — drawing near to him, that they might obtain the bless- 
ings that he has promised those who serve him and keep his com- 
mandments. 

THE AUTHORITY OF THE LORD 

I know that the authority of the Lord is here. I know that 
the man who stands at the head of this Church is inspired, and I 
wish that all of you might know of his willingness to sacrifice for 
the. blessing of those to whom he ministers. I wish you could 
all know of the faith and devotion of his counselors, as they sit hour 
by hour giving the very best that is in their lives, to plan for the 
good of humanity, not only for us but for all mankind. 

I wish you could be associated as I have had the privilege of 
being with the good men who lead the Church, the First Pres- 
idency, the Quorum of the Twelve, the Patriarch, the First Council 
of Seventy and the Presiding Bishopric, these men whose lives are 
devoted to the blessings of mankind. I wish you could know them 
as I know them. I want to say that if you did, no one would come 
to you with any suggestion of wrong-doing charged against them 
without being defended by you, realizing that they are indeed the 
servants of the Lord 

. GRATITUDE FOR BLESSINGS 

I am grateful for my fellowship in this Church. I have never 
asked for positions of honor. I have always been pleased to work 
wherever I have been called, and in the mercy of the Lord he has 
given me strength, thus far, to carry out in part the requirements 
that have been made of me. I stand here my heart filled with 
gratitude to him who rules and reigns on high, for the privilege 
that I enjoy at this moment, being with this marvelous congrega- 
tion, and of talking to you as I am permitted to do, and I hope that 
his children who may be listening in will feel the blessing that we 
enjoy, as this service proceeds under the direction of the Prophet 
of the Lord. 

god's work 

This is God's work. It 'is not the work of any man. No man 
or set of men could have carried it forward and made it successful 
in the face of the opposition of the world. Many times they have 
felt that the end of the Church had come, and each tim-e by the 
majesty of his power, the Lord has lifted it up, and it has gone 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 123 



forward from city to city, from village to village, from nation to 
nation, and here in the tops of the everlasting hills he has fulfilled 
his revelation to the Prophet Joseph Smith, that the people were 
to become a mighty people in the midst of the Rocky Mountains. 

Our work has only just begun. As I look into the future and 
realize the possibilities, the prayer that is in my heart is Father in 
heaven, help us that we may resist evil, that we may banish from 
our lives selfishness, that we may love one another, and wherever 
we may go, that those to whom we minister may feel that love' 
and be touched thereby, that they may desire to be members of 
such an organization as this. 

I pray that the Lord will bless him who presides over us and 
bless his counselors, that they may live long to direct us, that they 
may continue to labor under the inspiration of our HeaVenly 
Father, for I know that they have labored that way in the past. 
May we who labor under their direction, we who serve in the various 
departments of this Church, live so near to him who rules and 
reigns on high that we will know our duty when the word is spoken 
by those whom he has called to preside and that we may not be 
swayed by the fallacies, the foolishness and the philosophies of 
men. 

God bless you, my brethren and sisters, and his children every- 
where in the world, that his power and the inspiration of his Spirit, 
and the knowledge of his truth may come to them, that ,this world 
may become filled with the glory of righteousness, I humbly pray, 
in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

The Choir and congregation sang the hymn "Come, let us anew." 

ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

A hundred years ago this last June the Lord Jesus Christ delivered 
a message to the Church that I consider most important and applicable 
just now, and I desire to read a portion of it from the fifty-sixth 
section of the Book of Doctrine and Covenants: 

"Wo unto you rich men, that will not give your substance to the poor, for 

your riches will canker your souls; and this shall be your lamentation in the 

day of visitation, and of judgment, and of indignation: The harvest is past, the 
summer is ended, and my soul is not saved!" 

The only security that rich men have today comes out of obedience 
to law and order, and unless there is a liberal giving I am sure that 
great uncertainty may be experienced by those of great wealth. 

THE RICH MAN'S OBLIGATION 

What should a rich man give? His tenth. That belongs to the 
Lord, for man is but a steward of it. I do feel to rejoice in my heart 
that in this Church we do have men of means who give their tenth. 



124 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



But, oh, how difficult it is for some to pay an honest tithing when they 
make much money! They can do it very well when their income is 
small, but when they get to the point of giving a hundred dollars it 
is about as far as many can go, no matter what their income may be. 

I wish that throughout the whole length of the land today every 
man of wealth would feel his obligation to the Lord Almighty for his 
stewardship, and that he would give one-tenth at least of his income 
each year for the charity that is so necessary to provide for the hungry. 
As I have seen in various sections of this country great groups of 
hungry and idle men who seek work, it would seem to be but a simple 
thing that they, like in Russia, would reach the point where they would 
take possession of property unlawfully and illegally. There is only 
one way by which that may be averted. They must be fed, they must 
be cared for. 

EVERY MAN A BEGGAR 

There may be an objection, however, that these have been unwise 
men and are suffering for their own sins. But nevertheless, let me 
read what the Lord has to say on that subject also, because the people 
referred to in the Book of Mormon, I presume, had times very much 
like ours. In the fourth chapter of Mosiah I read the following: 

"And also, ye yourselves will succor those that stand in need of your succor ; 
ye will administer of your substance unto him that standeth in need ; and ye 
will not suffer that the beggar putteth up his petition to you in vain, and turn 
him out to perish. 

"Perhaps thou shalt say : The man has brought upon himself his misery ; 
therefore I will stay my hand, and will not give unto him of my food, nor 
impart unto him of my substance that he may not suffer, for his punishments 
are just — 

"But I say unto you, O man, whosoever doeth this the same hath great 
cause to repent; and except he repenteth of that which he hath done he perishetb 
forever, and hath no interest in the kingdom of God. 

"For behold, are we not all beggars? Do we not all depend upon the same 
Being, even God, for all the substance which we have, for both food and 
raiment, and for gold, and for silver, and for all the riches which we have of 
every kind? 

"And behold, even at this time, ye have been calling on his name, and 
begging for a remission of your sins. And has he suffered that ye have begged in 
vain?" 

Every man needs the pardon of God. Every man is a beggar, 
because he is pleading for that which he does not have himself, though 
he may be possessed of all the wealth of the world. One thing the 
Lord has clearly indicated is that no matter how worthy or unworthy, 
every one of his children should have food and shelter. Beyond that, 
however, we may not be able to go. 

A WORD TO THE POOR 

And now, a word to those who are in need, the poor. I am 
reading again from the fifty-sixth section of the Doctrine and Cove- 
nants, the balance of that admonition: 

"Wo unto you poor men, whose hearts are not broken, whose spirits are 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 



125 



not contrite, and whose bellies are not satisfied, and whose hands are not stayed 
from laying hold upon other men's goods, whose eyes are full of greediness, 
and who will not labor with your own hands !" 

Their attitude is equally as objectionable in the sight of the Lord 
as that of the stingy rich. Let the poor, therefore, not be possessed 
of the spirit of Bolshevism that would unlawfully take possession of 
that which does not belong to them. 

I am pleading that the Latter-day Saints will respond to the 
appeals that are made. Last night the Presiding Bishop of our Church 
informed the brethren that every bishop in a ward where Latter-day 
Saints are in a majority should care for the hungry and see that none 
goes without food or shelter, whether he belongs to this Church or not ; 
and that is why we need the support of your tithes and offerings, that 
the poor may not lift up their appeals in vain. And the poor who re- 
ceive these blessings must be patient. This is not the time for them 
to be possessed of other men's goods. They must be wise and prudent 
in the future, to store up against such a day as this, and consider them- 
selves fortunate that they are provided with food and shelter during 
these trying times. They should not become envious and jealous and 
full of the spirit of anarchy. That is not the spirit of the Christ. 

THE LORD'S PROMISE 

"But blessed are the poor," the Lord continues — and I would add, and I feel 
sure it is in harmony with the spirit of this text — blessed are the rich too — 
"who are pure in heart, whose hearts are broken, and whose spirits are contrite, 
for they shall see the kingdom of God coming in power and great glory unto 
their deliverance ; for the fatness of the earth shall be theirs. 

"For behold, the Lord shall ,come, and his recompense shall be with 
him, and he shall reward every man, and the poor shall rejoice; 

"And their generations shall inherit the earth from generation to generation, 
forever and ever." ; 

Such a promise will be realized and that through the coming of 
the kingdom of God. 

DEVELOPMENT IN ADVERSITY 

I believe that these experiences through which we are now passing 
all have their lesson. What is the lesson the Latter-day Saints should 
learn from the experiences of today? But three or four years ago, 
in the midst of our greatest prosperity, I was attracted by a question 
propounded to Mr. C. W. Barron, who owned the Wall Street Journal— 
I think he has since passed away— one of the greatest financiers of our 
country. Some man had declared that there would be a hundred 
years of uninterrupted prosperity in the United States, and to that 
proposition Mr. Barron answered: 

"Will there be a hundred years of uninterrupted prosperity?" I asked. He 
shook his head. 

"Why not?" , . . . . 

"I expected him to show me a chart or say something about the business 
cycle,' or 'economic fundamentals,' or to use some of the other well-worn 
phrases. But to my relief he took an entirely different approach. 



126 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



"There will not be a century of uninterrupted good times, because the universe 
is not arranged on that basis," he said. "What is taking place on this earth is 
a great experiment in the development of human character. (The Creator 
is not interested in money or markets, but in more enduring men. 

"Such men are not developed when everything is easy. They never come 
out of the countries where the sun shines every day. Trials develop them ; 
problems develop them ; suffering develops them. As long as the present 
Divine plans continue to operate, we shall continue to have enough setbacks to 
keep the race from growing altogether soft. Years ago, Roger Babson made a 
chart on which one wavy line represented national prosperity and the other 
wavy line showed church membership. It was decidedly interesting. When 
money rolls in too easily and too long, men drift away, not only from their 
churches, but from hard work and simple living ; they form extravagant tastes ; 
they take long chances. 

"Then came the panic. Their easy wealth evaporates. They clear their 
lives of rubbish and start in again on the sound basis of economy, worship and 
work. Sometime the race may develop to a point where it can stand prosperity 
all the time, but in our present state hard times still have their needed work 
to do." 

god's plan to be established 

Yes, I believe there will come a time when we can stand prosperity 
all the time, and that time will be when that order which God established 
in the heavens before man lived upon the earth, is set up. 

Upon various occasions in the past the Lord has endeavored to 
establish that order — in the days of Enoch, as referred to by President 
Nibley this morning, and in the days of Christ himself while he min- 
istered among men upon the eastern hemisphere and upon the western 
hemisphere also. He has revealed to this Church his plan for the 
equitable distribution of the wealth of the world, which is his. We 
have gone forward marvelously in mass production; and now, brethren 
and sisters, it is essential that we shall have mass distribution. We 
will have these recurring periods until the people learn, as learn 1 
believe they will in time through these experiences, to let the Lord's 
plan become established. 

THE LORD'S RENTAL 

I am happy that the Church, a hundred years nearer the solution 
of this problem than anyone else, is making headway. Sometime 
after the order referred to was revealed to the Prophet the Lord gave 
the law of tithing. That is the thing that concerns us now. It is the 
schoolmaster to prepare us for this greater, this bigger thing. The 
law of tithing is just and righteous. We need the blessing of the 
Lord today, of a material character. No man would think for a 
moment that he was not under obligation to pay rental to the owner 
for land that he tilled ; and yet the owner cannot guarantee that the 
rain shall fall, that the snow shall come in the mountains, that the 
moisture so essential shall be provided, that the sun will shine, that the 
grain will germinate, that the harvest will come. Someone else must 
provide these essentials without which your farm is of little more 
value than an ash heap. 

Who provides these other important blessings? The Lord Al- 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 



127 



mighty. Is he entitled to recognition and rental? Yes. The earth 
is the Lord's. It belongs to him, and we are but tenants. We owe 
him a rental, and he has enjoined upon us that a just rental is ten 
per cent of that which we obtain from the soil and from our labor. 
You expect, I am sure, to live in an eternal world with an eternal 
possession. How can any man who understands this law hope to have 
an eternal inheritance in this world, celestialized by the power of Christ, 
unless he has paid his tithing? It is the law of inheritance. He will 
establish a right to an eternal inheritance if he has paid his rental. 

CHURCH GROWTH 

The Lord's work, however, is making progress. It is going for- 
ward. I am not disturbed by the things that are now occurring. In 
the beginning of this Church he declared that the time had come 
when everything would be shaken that could be shaken and that that 
which he had established would stand. The Lord has been shaking 
to the very foundation the fortresses of evil, of error, of darkness, 
of skepticism, and of apostasy. The Lord has been building up the 
truth by the same process. Just a slight reference to it : A recent 
report of the census of the United States reveals the fact that in the 
last decade, of the twenty-three religious denominations of the United 
States six of them show a loss of membership. This Church is one 
of the twenty-three, but there is not another one in the group whose 
percentage of growth is equal to the growth of this Church. 

The Christian Herald of recent issue calls attention to the fact that 
last year. 1930, the one hundredth anniversary of the birth of this 
Church, for the first time in one hundred years the Methodist Church of 
the United States lost membership. Its loss was 42,211 souls. The 
Presbyterian Church's loss was 22,763 souls, while the great Catholic 
Church, the largest Christian religion in the United States, had a growth 
of only 17,526 souls, a growth that this Church exceeded last year. 
The growth of total membership in the year 1928 in the United States 
was a million souls, the next year it dropped to 242,000, and the 
following year, last year, it was 88,000. The Lord Almighty is shaking 
the foundations of error and man-made institutions, while this, his 
work, stands all the tests that have been applied to it, the test of mob 
violence, the test of persecution, and now I am sure it will stand 
whatever test the future holds for we are founded upon the truth. 

PROPHESIES GOOD FOR ZION 

God help us, my brethren and sisters, to see our glorious oppor- 
tunity, to adhere more closely than ever before to these Gospel principles. 
Don't you brethren become discouraged. Don't you leave your farms. 
This is no time to sell your land, no time to desert your flocks and 
herds. I prophesy good for Zion if the Latter-day Saints will only 
serve God and keep his commandments. You shah be delivered 
financially, delivered from that which oppresses you, but among the 
wicked there shall be times of trouble. The devil is in the earth to 



128 



GENERAL CONEERENCE 



try to reclaim his kingdom. God is here to help the progress of his 
work, for that glorious day of the coming of his Son must arrive, and 
the Lord Almighty is at work to that end. 

The Lord help us to be wise and learn the lessons out of the present 
and profit by them in the future, and listen to the counsels of this 
glorious conference, for I bear witness that the Lord is here, the light 
is in the ship. It is with the leaders of this Church. I know it. 
You have had witness of it this day and during the other sessions of 
this conference that shall remain with you forever and ever. God grant 
it, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I regret exceedingly that we have not had the pleasure of hearing 
from President B. H. Roberts of the First Council of Seventy, and from 
Brother Joseph W. McMurrin, both of whom have, for many years at 
the various conferences that I have attended, lifted their voices in 
testimony of the divinity of the work in which we are engaged. 

The General Authorities and Officers of the Church and the 
Auxiliary Officers and Boards were then presented, and by unanimous 
vote of those assembled were sustained in their various offices and 
callings as follows :

Inasmuch as some people say that we always present the name of 
the person nominated to fill a vacancy in the leading councils of the 
Church, in a group with those previously chosen and ordained, so that 
the people do not have an opportunity to vote against him, I shall put 
this separate motion : All those in favor of sustaining Brother Joseph 
F. Merrill as a member of the Council of the Twelve Apostles, filling the

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

In case any person fails to fully appreciate the plain statement 
of President Ivins that the book to which he referred is to be con- 
sidered as the personal opinion of the author and not as having 
been approved by the Church, I wish all the members of the Church 
to know that when any book has the approval of the Church St 
will have the stamp of approval of the Presidency of the Church. 
Therefore, no agent selling any books is justified in quoting the 
Church as approving a book that does not carry the stamp of . 
approval in it. 

I believe that for the first and only time since I became the 
President of the Church it is not four o'clock when the time has 
arrived to call upon the choir to sing and for the final benediction 
to be pronounced. 

It has fallen to my lot on more than one occasion to make a few 
remarks after four o'clock. We are all willing to stay here after 
four o'clock, I am sure, to hear the choir in the closing anthem. 
Therefore, there are ten full minutes left for me, for which I am 
grateful. 

GRATEFUL FOR CONFERENCE 

First, I am thankful for this wonderful conference. I believe 
sincerely that today we have had as many if not more in attendance 
than is usual at our Sunday morning and afternoon meetings. It 
seemed to me that we were more crowded this morning than at 
any other time I can remember. 

I am grateful that what to me was the most marvelous sight 
I have looked upon -in this building was that which I witnessed last 
night when the building was nearly filled with members holding 
the priesthood of the living God. Let me say that with all ,our 
faults and failings I believe we are the best people in the world. 
It 'Sounds a little egotistical, but I believe every word of it, and I 
believe firmly that our sisters are better than the brethren, t, 
haven't any doubt of this, none whatever. There was a magnifi- 
cent showing here last night of the priesthood, and from the 
bottom of my heart and in the authority of the priesthood of the 
living God that I hold I have great pleasure in blessing the men 
who hold the priesthood of God, the power from heaven, and in 
blessing our wives who, on an average, have been more devoted, I am 
sure, to the work of the living God than we have been. 

LOYALTY TO PRESIDENT HOOVER AND ASSOCIATES 

I rejoice in the splendid work of the Latter-day Saints. I de- 
sire and $ee\ to pray for the blessings of the Lord to be and abide 
with the President of the United States and his cabinet in this time 
of great trouble, in a time when we should be loyal. "We believe 
in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers and magistrates." Let 
us be loyal to those who in the providences of the Lord stand at

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



the head of our nation at the present time, in this great time of 
trouble.. I am >sure nobody will accuse me, seeing- I am counted 
as a Democrat, of being guilty of mixing politics with religion 
here ; but I believe that no truer, better, finer man has ever sat in 
the presidential chair than the man who is sitting there today. 
That is my opinion of President Hoover. 

A STRAW VOTE 

Some years ago for the first and only time in my life I paid 
some attention /to a straw vote. I do not think such votes amount 
to a straw; that is my opinion of them. I think that if there is 
ever any "stuffing" in ballot boxes it is when a straw vote is being 
taken. I think it is properly named "straw vote." It is as weak as 
a straw. But I could not resist the temptation way back many 
years ago, when the Literary Digest asked for a straw vote, and lo 
and behold, I voted for Hoover. That was my opinion of the man 
who had >done so much, such magnificent and wonderful work 
during the war, in feeding the people in Europe. I believe that he is 
absolutely honest and conscientious and that his heart is as firmly 
set upon doing the right thing for the people of this country, as the 
hearts of the Jeaders of this Church are set upon doing the right 
thing for the Latter-day Saints. 

I am happy indeed in a knowledge of the divinity of the work 
you and /I are engaged in. I humbly pray for the blessings of the 
Lord to be with each and all of you, with the Latter-day Saints 
the world over, and the honest in every land and every clime. God 
bless you, Amen. 

As a closing anthem the Choir sang the Hallelujah Chorus, by 
Handel. 

The benediction was pronounced by Elder Taylor Nelson, President 
of the Oneida Stake. 

Conference adjourned for six months. 

Prof. Anthony C. Lund, assisted by B. Cecil Gates, conducted the 
singing of the Choir and congregation at the Conference meetings. Ac- 
companiments and interludes on the great organ were played by Edward 
P. Kimball and Frank W. Asper. 

Stenographic notes of the Conference were taken by Frank W. 
Otterstrom and Joseph Anderson. 

Joseph Anderson, 

Clerk of the Conference.

ERA and other Church publications during the last ten years, and friends 
have been good enough to say, repeatedly, that they would be glad to have

on their suggestion, I have collected some papers previously published and 
others that now appear for the first time, and respectfully submit them in 
this form to the public. In doing so, it is my sincere prayer that the testi- 
mony here offered may be of benefit to the reader, and especially to honest

A veritable epic of empire-building 

The Life Story of 
Brigham Young 

By SUSA YOUNG GATES AND LEAH D. WIDTSOE 
WITH A FOREWORD BY HONORABLE REED SMOOT 

"This book presents the life story of a New England cabinet-maker, 
who, well into his thirties, entered npon a career that made him an empire* 
builder of the West; the founder of a hundred cities; the governor of one 
of the territories of the United States; and one of the outstanding figures 
of the nineteenth century." 

Thus does Senator Smoot begin his enthusiastic foreword to this notable 
biography. "A graphic, gripping story," he terms it, and every reader 
undoubtedly will agree with his definition of this life of the indefatigable, 
indomitable Brigham Young, which was written by one of his daughters 
and her daughter. The entire record of the great Mormon leader is un- 
folded from his birth in a little Vermont town to his death at the age of 
seventy-seven as head of the church, the success of which was due to his 
courageous and arduous leadership.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



FIRST DAY 
MORNING MEETING 

The first session of the One Hundred and Eighth Annual Confer- 
ence was held Sunday morning, April 3, 1938, at 10 o'clock a. m. 

Long before time to commence the Conference every seat and avail- 
able space in the largeTabernacle auditorium and galleries was occupied. 
In addition, thousands of people congregated in the large Assembly Hall 
immediately south of the Tabernacle, and on the Tabernacle grounds, 
where, by means of amplifying equipment that had been installed, they 
listened to the Conference proceedings as they were broadcast from the 
Tabernacle. 

President Grant opened the Conference by announcing that the Tab- 
ernacle Choir would furnish the music for this session and would join 
with the congregation in singing the hymn, "Redeemer of Israel." 

After the singing of this hymn, the opening prayer was offered by 
Elder Samuel E. Bringhurst, President of the Cottonwood Stake. 

ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 

Presiding Bishop of the Church 

I am grateful, my brethren and sisters, for this opportunity of 
being with you in health and strength to enjoy the spirit of this Con- 
ference. There are many things that might be discussed, many things 
of great import in the progress and welfare of this people, and I am 
sure they will be brought out during the Conference. The time available 
to me prior to the Tabernacle broadcast is limited and will permit of 
brief remarks only. 

IMPORTANCE OF OBEDIENCE 

In thinking over that which I might say I have thought of many 
things, and among other things one of the greatest and most important 
is that spirit which brings us to a unity and a willingness to cooperate 
and to comply with the desires and instructions of our leaders, and 
particularly with regard to the observance of the laws and command- 
ments of the Lord, which is the principle of obedience. 

When Saul, king of Israel, was instructed by Samuel the prophet 
to fight the Amalekites, who had been a bar in the way of the children 
of Israel in their trailing through the wilderness, he failed to do what 
he was instructed, and Samuel rebuked him in these words : 

Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as 
in obeying the word of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice 
and to hearken than the fat of rams. 

Saul was rejected by the Lord as a result of his disobedience and 
failure to comply with the instructions which he had received from the 
Lord's servant. 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON

RESULTS OF DISOBEDIENCE COME IN NATURAL WAY 

Now, as a matter of fact nothing apparently happened, because 
Saul continued as the king of Israel. Anyone who heard that statement 
of Samuel's might have concluded that it had failed. But Samuel had 
gone, under the instruction of the Lord, to Bethlehem, and there had 
selected another man and had anointed him to become king of Israel. I 
say Saul remained as king for some time before the judgment of the 
Lord came upon him. After a certain time he went into battle and was 
killed in a natural way in the fight. And that I think is an evidence of 
what we may expect of mankind wherever we live. If we learn to obey 
the instructions that are given us, and especially if there come to us 
instructions from those who have authority; or if we fail to comply 
with the laws and commandments that the Lord has given us, we are in 
the way of undergoing condemnation. It may come about in a perfectly 
natural way, because obedience or disobedience to spiritual or natural 
law, or to civil law, brings the reward or the penalty in every instance. 

THE GOSPEL A PERFECT LAW OF LIBERTY 

The Apostle James, in speaking in regard to the importance of 
observance of divine law, and at the same time the perfect freedom of 
agency of every individual to do as he or she chooses, makes this state- 
ment : 

But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth 
therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this 
man shall be blessed in his deed. 

Every principle given to us of the Lord as a part of the Gospel is a 
law of liberty, and the Gospel as a whole is the perfect law of 
liberty. We have the choice whether we shall accept it or reject 
it, whether we shall live it, or shall fail to observe its commandments ; 
but according to that which we shall do shall we be judged, and that is 
perfect fairness and justice, not only in this life but in the life to come. 

OBSERVANCE OF LAW 

I might discourse at length, but time will not permit, with regard 
to the benefits that come to us through the observance of law. As 
Latter-day Saints we claim to obey, honor, and sustain the laws wherever 
we may be. Any man or woman, any boy or girl who fails to observe 
the constitutional laws, man-made though they may be, imperfect though 
they may be — if they fail to observe them they are the losers, and thereby 
if law-breaking continues there is confusion and destruction to civiliza- 
tion, whether in the community, the state, the nation, or the world. And 
to that extent it is very vital that we should realize that obedience means 
compliance with law, whether it is civil, natural, or spiritual. It is of 
vital importance to the continuance of progress of civilization. 

SOURCE OF UNITY 

I realize and you realize that if we observe to do what the Lord has 



4 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday, April 3 First Day 

commanded us and expects us to do, we shall grow in unity and power, 
because that is the very source of power of this people — their willingness 
to comply and thereby become united. Yet they lose nothing of their 
individuality or their understanding or their intelligence or their judg- 
ment. So that obedience to this perfect law of liberty brings us joy 
and blessings, as promised by the Apostle James. 

BLESSINGS PREDICATED UPON OBEDIENCE 

You will remember again the statement made by the Prophet Joseph 
Smith : 

There is a law irrevocably decreed in heaven, before the foundations 
of this world, upon which all blessings are predicated ; and when we obtain 
any blessing from God it is by obedience to that law upon which it is 
predicated. 

This applies to every principle of the Gospel. I will not take the 
time to discuss them in detail, I need only say to you that every principle 
of the Gospel that the Lord has given us is positive and forward-looking, 
and everything contrary to that is negative. Thereby we may conclude 
that everything we learn that is of light and advancement, that is 
true and exalted and forward-looking is of God and intended for the 
welfare and progress of mankind. It requires action, it requires dis- 
cernment, it requires judgment to observe these conditions and to be 
obedient. The opposite is to fail and to neglect, which is negative, and 
only brings us sorrow and sadness. By doing wrong things we are 
doing negative things ; by doing right things we are doing positive things. 

DIVINE PRINCIPLES 

Now, without going into detail, because time will not permit, I 
might refer you to some of the things the Lord has commanded us to do. 
In the first place he has commanded us to teach our children correct 
principles, that they may live righteously, that they may grow in the 
knowledge of the truth, and become faithful, active men and women 
in the Church. If we fail to do that as fathers and mothers we shall 
lose the blessing which would come to us otherwise ; and if our children 
fail to receive these things and observe them they will also lose the 
blessing. How unfortunate it is when children of faithful, upright 
parents, either through lack of proper watchcare, training or spiritual, 
loving influence succumb to temptations and lose the spirit of the Gospel \ 

If we fail to observe the Word of Wisdom — that great standard 
of physical welfare — we are losing control of our better selves. If we 
observe it we learn to control our appetites and desires and our passions, 
so far as they affect us physically. One course is positive. It means 
self-control. The other is negative. It produces excesses. 

With regard to the observance of the Sabbath day: If we live in 
accordance with that instruction we shall grow in clear thinking, in peace, 
and in right living. If we break the commandments we give ourselves 
to thoughtless pleasure, we are losing that sense of relationship with the 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON

divine and interfering with our progress. Likewise, if we cultivate 
hatred, envy, and jealousy instead of cultivating love, we develop negative 
instead of positive qualities — lower instead of higher — and suffer thereby. 
On the contrary, if we cultivate love for our fellow men generally and 
all who are dear to us, and for our Heavenly Father, then we grow in 
righteousness, peace and happiness. 

POSITIVE QUALITIES PROMOTE REAL HAPPINESS 

The same is true of morality. If we observe the principles of clean 
living which we are instructed to observe, we shall grow in faith and 
strength and power, and if we fail to do so we shall grow in vice and 
licentiousness, which are prevalent throughout the world today. Another 
principle that develops finer characteristics in men and women is that of 
fasting, the donating of the value of the food that would otherwise be 
consumed. If we practice it we develop in the spirit of self-denial and 
charity — two of the greatest qualities we can possess. Failure to live 
it invites selfishness, and hinders proper restraint. Again, if we are 
growing in faith we are becoming stronger and abler spiritually and 
thereby we shall increase in unity. On the contrary, if we cultivate 
doubt, and carping criticism, we hinder advancement and lose the oppor- 
tunities that are ours. Then again, if we fail to observe the law of tithing, 
a divine law given us for our progress, a principle with a promise, we 
gain spiritual and temporal blessings. If we disobey it those benefits 
will be denied us. The observance of these principles develops the 
qualities in men and women most vital to civilization. 

I want to call your attention to the fact that we have been in- 
structed by our brethren who preside over the Church here upon the 
earth to observe all of these principles. I think that in large measure 
Latter-day Saints are endeavoring to observe them. The more fully 
we observe them the greater the blessings to us. We are the ones who 
gain or lose by living or failing to observe these commandments, these 
instructions and principles. 

So, my brethren and sisters, I urge upon you that, as far as you have 
influence, you exercise that influence with the Church officers and mem- 
bers by example and by kindly encouragement, to observe every principle 
which the Lord has given through his servants. Such observance inures 
first to the welfare and progress of the individual, and, secondly, for the 
Church as a whole. 

RESPONSIBILITY OF CHURCH OFFICERS 

I remember that six months ago President Grant gave certain 
instructions with regard to what is expected of the officers of the Church 
in the observance of its principles. I think there should be no neglect 
or failure whatever in our faithful observance of these things. There 
is every reason why every man or woman who receives authority in this 
Church should set the example of righteous living in every way. The 
giving of authority requires a faithful compliance with every request 
made of us. Further, there is no request made that is not reasonable.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



First Day 



Time will not permit my speaking further. I pray the Lord to bless 
us continually and may his choice favors continue with us throughout 
this Conference, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

TABERNACLE CHOIR AND ORGAN BROADCAST 

During the period from 10 :30 to 1 1 :00 a. m. the following program 
of choral and organ music was presented by the Tabernacle Choir and 
Organ, in the Tabernacle, as a part of the General Conference session, 
and was broadcast by radio throughout the United States and Canada 
by the courtesy of the Columbia Broadcasting System, originating over 
Station KSL, Salt Lake City: 



"Again as Evening's Shadow Falls" (Fletcher) Choir 

"In Springtime" (Kinder) Organ 

"The Morning Breaks" (Careless) Male Choir 

"To Thee, O Lord" (Kalinnikoff) Choir 

Hymn arrangements by organist Organ 

"Praise" (Rowley) Choir 



The Choir was conducted by J. Spencer Cornwall. Organ accom- 
paniments and Organ solo presentations were played by Frank W. Asper. 

CHURCH OF THE AIR BROADCAST 

Immediately following the Tabernacle Choir and Organ Broadcast, 
the following program was presented on the Columbia Broadcasting Sys- 
tem's Church of the Air series : 

The Choir and congregation joined in singing the hymn, "O Say, 
What is Truth?" 

ELDER ALBERT E. BOWEN 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

Observing the orderliness and unity of purpose obtaining among his 
followers, who had been gathered from various countries of the world 
and from numerous nationalities and creeds, a visitor to the Prophet 
Joseph Smith asked: 

"Mr. Smith, how do you govern these people?" 

Promptly came the pregnant reply, "I teach them correct principles 
and they govern themselves." 

Thus tersely is stated a concept fundamental in the creed of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints — self-government fashioned 
upon fixed and enduring principles. It is a statement of the ideal in 
government. As concerns the individual, it is a statement of the law of 
progress, the law of salvation. 

STABILIZING POWER OF AN ULTIMATE AIM 



The discovery of eternal, unchanging principles, upon which the 
lives of men may securely be built, is the end of all search. We believe 



ELDER ALBERT E. BOWEN

that such principles are to be found in the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth. 
Those teachings constitute our religion, whose mission it is to lead men 
to exercise over themselves a moral restraint, to curb the desires of their 
hearts, to guide their thoughts and actions into true channels, and to tie 
themselves down to the precepts of divine justice that they may be pre- 
pared for the eternity of life and progress that lies beyond. 

Everyone must feel the need for an ultimate aim in life — an abiding 
purpose. Without it there would be nothing to stand between a person 
and a surrender to the fitful direction of casual impulses. Many men 
who do not consider themselves religious nevertheless have high objec- 
tives and pursue them with fidelity, but they have adopted from some 
source a body of principles which constitute their code of living. Without 
the stabilizing power of such guides a man's life would be "like the waves 
of the sea, driven with the wind and tossed." There could result only 
futility of action and frustration of purpose. 

SELF-GOVERNMENT BASED ON OBSERVANCE OF CORRECT PRINCIPLES 

In secular relations the necessity for guiding principles has long been 
recognized. The whole body of our law has grown up out of the need 
for certainty. It constitutes a body of principles by which men regulate 
their relations. If there were no such fixed guides subscribed to and 
faithfully observed in the great majority of instances, there could be no 
dealing. Distress and confusion would reign supreme just as it does 
today in the family of nations. 

Furthermore, if the process of the law had to be invoked to compel 
obedience to its established principles in every transaction in which men 
engaged, human intercourse would be impossible. The whole legal 
mechanism would come tumbling down of its own weight. Human so- 
ciety is able to carry on only because the vast majority of men freely and 
voluntarily and as a matter of individual morality conform their con- 
duct to the body of principles laid down in the law. Indeed, because they 
observe principles of morality which have not been enacted into law — -but 
are outside of and above its compulsions — they are self-governing, which 
brings us back to the second proposition of our discussion: Having 
been taught correct principles, "They govern themselves." 

Any system of government which depends for its continuance upon 
the compelled obedience of any considerable part of its citizens is fore- 
doomed to ultimate failure, because it is violative of the principle of free- 
dom which is a God-given quality coextensive with life, and, like life, 
one of man's inalienable rights. 

U. S. CONSTITUTION PROTECTS RIGHT OF SELF-GOVERNMENT 

What Lincoln called the sentiments of the Declaration of Independ- 
ence — the whole essence of it — is that every human being, and every 
community of human beings, has some rights which no power on earth, 
not even government itself, is authorized to infringe. Every line in that 
Declaration is repugnant to the present day revival, in parts of the world, 
of the anachronistic dogma which undertakes to regiment the lives of

Sunday, April 3 First Day 

men into mere vassalage to the state. Such philosophy is in brutal contra- 
diction of the basic concepts of the Gospel of Jesus Christ ; which teaches 
that man, the spirit of him, was in the beginning with God ; that Jesus 
Christ is in truth his elder brother ; that as the offspring of Deity, through 
free acceptance of and adherence to the eternal law of progress, man's 
congenital immortality may unfold till he reaches the plane achieved by 
his "elder brother". This, the very essence of the theology of the Latter- 
day Saints, is flatly denied by the totalitarian whose chief exponent has 
said that the ideal of happiness and indefinite progress is a "myth," and 
the inevitable consequence of whose teaching is the exaltation of the bar- 
barities of paganism over the humane precepts of the Son of Man. 

The people of America have been the freest people on earth precise- 
ly because more of the activities of life have here been left to self-direction 
than has been the case anywhere else and the domain occupied by govern- 
ment has been correspondingly more circumscribed. It is an historical 
certainty that the express purpose of the framers of the' Constitution of 
the United States was to establish under it a government for the protec- 
tion of their newly won liberties. Its highest sanctions are free speech, 
free press, free elections, a free legislature, a free judiciary and a definite 
limitation upon the powers of government over the lives of men. All 
these the modernistic despotisms — under whatever name — deny. 

Latter-day Saints believe that these are divine principles and that 
the men who formulated them into a system of government were acting 
under the inspiration of the Almighty, in the majesty of whose name every 
man who comes into office under it binds himself by oath that he will pre- 
serve and defend it. Here we clasp hands with the Honorable Hatton 
W. Sumners, chairman of the Judiciary Committee of the House of Rep- 
resentatives of the United States, who recently said : 

They were great men who sat in the Constitutional Convention but it 
has been withheld from human genius to write the constitution of a living 
government. It never has been done and never will be in a creative sense. 
Our Constitution came from the same source that trees came from. . . . 
The people no longer believe that there lived at one time a group of super- 
men, who met in a convention and out of their own creative genius 
fashioned the constitution of a living government. . . . The fact of it is 
our Constitution is worthy of all reverence among a people who love liberty, 
because it came from God Almighty. 

Parenthetically may I remark that in this sabre-rattling, demagogue- 
shouting, Deity-banishing age of arrogant self-sufficiency, it is refreshing 
to hear words of humility issuing from the mouth of one in high station. 

PERFECTION POSSIBLE 

Freedom signifies more than a release from outward restraint. It 
is an essence, a quality of the spirit whose rarest blossoms, in an atmos- 
phere of oppression, wither and die. As is said by Justice Maxy, "Where- 
ever autocracy has prevailed, thought has been enslaved, society stratified 
into castes and enterprise discouraged. The era of Autocracy Ascendant 
was the 'dark ages of the world'. Progress came only when shackles 
began to be loosed from minds and chains from limbs." 



ELDER ALBERT E. BOW EN

In our conception, the whole purpose and object of life is to achieve 
individual perfection through the unfolding of individual potentialities 
and the ripening of all the virtues. Learning, extension of horizons, 
expansion of vision, poise of character, serenity of soul — these coveted 
fruits of the spirit — are the consequence of voluntary free acts. In the 
foul and noisome air of despotism they may neither quicken nor flower. 
They are outside the power of human bestowal or coercion ; they are in 
the realm of freedom. As these transcend physical acquisitions in value, 
so the principle of freedom transcends the power of force or compulsion. 

It is said that in the seed is a complete design of the tree. Planted 
in fertile soil, moistened by gently falling rains, warmed by the caressing 
rays of an effulgent sun, it unfolds : roots, trunk, branches, blossoms 
and fruit, the completed realization of its design. No amount of des- 
potic terrorism can cause a seed to unfold into a tree. 

Our institutions which protect us in our freedom of thought and of 
worship were the product of a thousand years of struggle against tyranny. 
But they have no guarantee of immortality except such guarantee as 
inheres in the will and the fitness of our people to be free. 

Freedom is not bestowed ; it is achieved. It is not a gift, but a con- 
quest. It does not abide ; it must be preserved. 

When signing the Constitution Franklin said that the government 
it created "can only end in despotism . . . when the people become so 
corrupted as to need a despotic government, being incapable of any other." 

So important is the principle of liberty, so essential is it to man's 
higher self-realization and so inexorably necessary to the dignity of his 
status as the issue of Deity that the omnipotent God himself does not 
countenance compulsion. Ample ancient and modern evidences of this 
have been scripturally recorded. For example, when the Prophet Samuel 
was grown old the people of Israel requested of him that he make them 
a king to judge them "like all the nations." Samuel was disturbed, 
thinking that Israel had repudiated him, but the Lord comforted him 
with these words : "Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they 
say unto thee, for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected 
me, that I should not reign over them." Certainly there is nothing here 
of compulsion on the part of One omnipotent. 

Closer to us in time, there is a like example of the Lord's respect 
for the liberty of men. Nine years after the organization of the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (one hundred and eight years ago 
next Wednesday) came the revealed law that the Priesthood of God, 
the governing authority of the Church, neither could nor ought to be 
maintained except by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and 
meekness and by love unfeigned ; by kindness and pure knowledge, and 
that it could not with impunity be exercised to gratify pride or ambition 
or to gain unjust control or compulsion upon the souls of men. 

Self-government involves self-control, self-discipline, an acceptance 
of and the most unremitting obedience to correct principles. Its de- 
mands are commensurate with its high privileges. Duties are the insepar- 
able companions of rights. No other form of government requires so 
high a degree of individual morality. "It is ordained in the eternal con-

stitution of things," said Burke, "that men of intemperate minds cannot 
be free." It is one of the missions of the Church to foster in men those 
virtues, without which there can be no self-government, and the alter- 
native to which is the mentally and spiritually sterilizing scourge of 
tyranny. 

Before we import despotic principles into our own land, which 
are so raucously clamoring for admission, we would better count the costs. 
Three weeks ago I read one morning the sickening, revolting story of an 
old world trial where the mockery of it was rendered the more cruel by 
the observance of outward legal form but devoid of every semblance of 
justice as known to free men. The sole offense of the accused was 
political disagreement with the will of the dictator. Then I walked into 
a United States Court where a Grand Jury was being impanelled. It 
comprised 16 men of the district of varied stations in life. They were 
instructed that under the Constitution no one could be called to answer 
for an offense against the government except upon presentment by a 
Grand Jury ; and that they alone, without fear or favor, without regard 
to the station of the accused, be it high or low, without extraneous influ- 
ence of any sort, but solely upon the evidence, must decide whether in- 
dictments should be returned. 

Thank God for Liberty ! 

May we and all the generations to come be as heroic in its preser- 
vation as were the Fathers in its establishment, that in our land freedom 
may abide forever. 

Selection by Male Chorus, "Praise to the Lord," (Storl-Cornwall) 
"Praise God from Whom All Blessings Flow" was sung by the Choir 
and congregation. 

After the conclusion of the Church of the Air broadcast, at the re- 
quest of President Heber J. Grant, the congregation sang the hymn "O, 
Ye Mountains High." 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I am sure that every Latter-day Saint within the sound of my voice 
has had great pleasure in listening to our program here this morning. 
I am sure that the testimony and the fine teachings of our Presiding 
Bishop have found echo in the hearts of all of you. I am sure that 
every Latter-day Saint who believes, according to a declaration of the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, that the men who wrote the Constitution were 
inspired of the living God, has rejoiced in Elder Bowen's remarks here 
this morning, and that the things he has said have found an echo in the 
hearts of all of you. 

EXPERIENCES IN BORROWING MONEY 

Speaking of this song that we have just sung, some of the words of 
which are, "On the necks of our foes we shall tread," etc., I had the 
pleasure of singing it while coming down from Pine Crest (Emigration

Canyon) in an automobile, to a dear friend of mine who is in the banking 
business, Mr. Fred W. Shibley. Mr. Shibley came to Utah to represent 
the banks of New York, Chicago, San Francisco and other places, that 
had lent $12,535,000 to the Utah-Idaho Sugar Company. 

When these loans were negotiated sugar was selling for $17.00 a 
bag of 100 pounds. When the beets were turned into sugar, sugar was 
selling at $5.00 a bag. We paid $12.00 a ton for the beets and we ex- 
pected to make four or five million dollars, but we had a loss of more 
than $5,800,000. We expected to have all our debts paid but we found 
ourselves in debt $7,535,000, and we needed some more for our next 
season's crop of beets. We had a practical illustration of Victor Hugo's 
remarks that "Gratitude is a lively sense of favors to come." Our farm- 
ers received over $5,000,000 more than their beets were worth, but the 
following year nearly all of our factories had to lie idle because the price 
of beets was not high enough. 

I went East to get a renewal of $7,000,000 of obligations with the 
banks, and in addition to borrow $2,800,000, instead of $12,000,000 as 
the year before. I had difficulty in getting the company notes ; but finally 
the bankers agreed to do so, and we were very grateful. They positively 
refused to lend us a dollar, however, in order to purchase preferred 
stock. I offered them local collateral and they asked for something that 
would sell on the New York Stock Exchange. I told them that I did 
not have any stocks or bonds that would sell on the New York Stock 
Exchange. One of the great bankers said, "Give us some Union Pacific 
preferred stocks or bonds." 

I said: "You must have been listening to Lulu Shepherd, perhaps 
the greatest female liar that ever drew the breath of life. She announced 
that I as President of the Mormon Church had over $100,000,000 in 
Union Pacific and other railroad preferred stocks and bonds." 

I had only one certificate of five shares of the common stock of the 
Union Pacific, and that was in my name. I had it transferred from 
President Joseph F. Smith back to the Church, and then I had it trans- 
ferred to myself, hoping to be elected a director, but "another Pharaoh 
arose that did not know Joseph," and I did not get the job. {Laughter) 
A year later, however, somehow or other they got acquainted with 
"Joseph," and then I got the job. 

INCIDENTS IN REGARD TO "o YE MOUNTAINS HIGH" 

I took Mr. Shibley to one of our scenic wonders — Brighton — and 
seeing there in her mother's cottage, next door, the good wife of the man 
who has been talking to us today (Albert E. Bowen), I suggested that 
we go over to their cottage and hear somebody sing who knew how to 
sing. We did so, and I said, "Now, Emma Lou, I sang the song, 'O Ye 
Mountains High,' for Mr. Shibley, and I would really like to have him 
hear someone sing it who knows how to sing." She sat down at the piano, 
and turned around and said, "Of course, President Grant, you do not 
want me to sing all four verses." 



12 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday, April 3 First Day 

I said, "I have already trod 'on the necks of our foes 'and made the 
'Gentiles bow beneath our rod,' give him all four. {Laughter.) 

After she had finished singing, I said : "Mr. Shibley, it must have 
shocked you for me, the President of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints, claiming that Jesus Christ himself organized it, 
claiming that God introduced Jesus Christ to the boy prophet, and be- 
lieving in the teachings of the Savior that we should turn the other cheek 
and love our enemies — it must have been a great shock to you to hear 
me singing that we should 'tread on the necks of our foes,' and that 'the 
Gentiles should bow beneath our rod;' so, I have arranged with the 
author, Charles W. Penrose, who is now in his 89th year and is as lively 
and wide awake and as fine a preacher as anyone in the whole Church, 
that after he passes away we will quit treading on the necks of our foes." 

Our old song books, however, have not been changed, but we are 
now singing, "Without fear of our foes we shall tread." 

Mr. Shibley said : "Don't you do it ; I am a student of the Bible, 
although agnostic, and that is a Bible figurative expression. You do 
not expect to step on the necks of your foes, but you do expect your 
foes to bow the neck to the rod of righteousness. Leave it alone, it is 
only once in a lifetime that a man gives off as inspirational a song as 
that." 

I said: "I have already pledged myself to change it after Brother 
Penrose dies." 

But lo, and behold, after hearing this compliment by a non-member 
of the Church I am, when singing it personally, going to make them 
bow to the rod of righteousness, even though it has been changed in 
the book. 

It is only fair to all of you to know that Charles W. Penrose spent 
ten long years of his life preaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ in his 
native land, England, without purse or scrip, and then he came to the 
valleys of the mountains ; but before coming here he wrote this beautiful, 
inspired hymn, without having seen our country. We feel that he was 
not only inspired as a poet, but he was inspired to describe our great and 
wonderful country. 

There are two spirits striving with all men — one telling them what 
to do that is right, and one telling them what to do that will please them- 
selves, that will gratify their own pride and ambition. If we live as we 
ought to live we will always follow that spirit that teaches us to do that 
which is right. 

REPENTANCE MEANS FORSAKING OF SIN 

I have heard many, since my talk here six months ago, say that tith- 
ing is a free-will offering and that Heber Grant is laying down a law. 
Tithing is a law of God and not Heber Grant's law. It is God who said 
that the people were robbing him — those who did not pay their tithing — 
not I. I can forgive any man almost any great sin if he repents, and 
"By this ye may know if a man repenteth of his sins — behold, he will 
confess them and forsake them." It does not do me individually any

good or any harm, no matter how a man lives, but I know as I know that 
I live that every man who serves God with full purpose of heart is reap- 
ing a remarkable and wonderful reward. "Men are that they might have 
joy," as recorded in the Book of Mormon, and there are no people on 
the face of the earth that have more real joy, more contentment, more 
peace of mind, more true happiness, than those who have a knowledge 
that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God, the 
Redeemer of mankind, our Savior, and who are living the laws that he 
has taught us. It brings a peace, a joy, and a satisfaction into the heart 
that money can not buy and that nothing else can buy. 

I have had men all over this country, during my long life, say 
to me : "Mr. Grant, your teachings are in harmony with the Bible, but 
I can not accept your teachings that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God." 

Speaking of our principles being in harmony with the Bible, when 
I reached Chicago, going East with Mr. Shibley, I handed him a couple 
of tracts to read. One of them was entitled, "Joseph Smith Tells His 
Own Story." 

By the way, Mr. Shibley made a very remarkable and wonderfully 
favorable report regarding our company, and recommended to the bank- 
ers that they lend us the money we wanted with which to buy preferred 
stock, in order to get a renewal of the $7,000,000 we owed them, but they 
would not do so. However, later, when Brother Smoot got us $10,000,000 
from Uncle Sam they concluded to let us have the more than two million 
dollars with which to pay for the preferred stock. They were a good 
deal like the fellow who went to the bank to get his money; — there was 
a run on the bank — and they offered it to him. He said : "What ! Have 
you got it? If you have it, I do not want it; if you don't have it I want 
it awfully bad." 

AN AGNOSTIC'S OPINION OF JOSEPH SMITHES STORY 

After reading the tract, "Joseph Smith Tells His Own Story," Mr. 
Shibley said to my son-in-law, Robert L. Judd (who had lunch with 
him) : "Do you know, that story of Joseph Smith's is true. No liar 
ever wrote such a story. Liars do not go into details. By every rule 
of my life to discover the truth this story is true. No liar would ever 
think of such a thing as saying that the Angel Moroni, who appeared to 
Joseph Smith and who afterwards gave him the golden plates from 
which the Book of Mormon was translated, had on a loose robe, and 
that it was open, and that he could see his bosom." 

And he pounded the table, so my son-in-law told me, when he 
said it. "No liar would ever think of saying that the angel's feet did 
not quite touch the floor and that the robe came to his ankles. Liars 
learn a story off by heart and stick to it, and they never go into details." 

When he was here he went back into the records of the Sugar Com- 
pany for twenty years. I wondered "What on earth is he going back so 
far for?" and when I heard of this remark I knew he was looking for 
something crooked and he did not find it, and that is why he made such 
an optimistic report, in my judgment. 



14 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday, April 3 First Day 



ARGUMENTS IN TRACT UNANSWERABLE 

The other tract that I gave him was, "My Reasons for Joining the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and Leaving the Church of 
England." When I had lunch with Mr. Shibley the next day he said : 

"Mr Grant, I am a student of the Bible, although an agnostic, but 
if I actually believed the Bible I would be almost compelled to join your 
Church. I say to you that no believer in the Bible can gainsay these 
arguments. That tract by your religious friend is unanswerable, but 
do you know, I have written books myself and I think I could write a 
better reason for leaving the Church of England and joining your 
Church than he wrote? 

I said : "Mr. Shibley, please remember that this man who knew the 
Bible so well and gave so many scriptural references to sustain our doc- 
trines which you say are unanswerable — please remember that he had 
reached the age of retiring on a pension of $5,000 a year as a Colonel 
in the British army, and that he had been known as a God-fearing man, 
a truly religious man all his life, and please remember that when he 
joined the Mormon Church he received letters from India and other 
places in the world asking, Why have you joined these awful Mormons ?" 

We all know of the drivings and the persecutions of the Latter-day 
Saints in New York; of the loss of our temple and being driven from 
Ohio ; of the order of the Governor of the State of Missouri that we leave 
the state or we would be annihilated ; that we were driven out of Nauvoo, 
Illinois, and our temple destroyed by fire ; and that finally we traveled 
1500 miles to these valleys. And what was this country at that time? 
A great sagebrush plain. One of the three women in the Pioneer com- 
pany remarked : "Worn and weary as I am, I would sooner go another 
thousand miles than stop in such a desolate place," and one of the others 
echoed that sentiment. But Brigham Young said: "This is the place, 
and here we will build an empire and a temple to our God." 

BRIGHAM YOUNG'S PLANS FOR EMPIRE 

If Brigham Young had got all he asked for, for the new State of 
Deseret, we would have built an empire here. What did he ask for? 
There was then no California, no Nevada, no Idaho, no New Mexico, 
no Arizona. He asked for all of Utah, much of Wyoming, nearly all 
of Colorado, enough of New Mexico to get the San Juan River, every 
foot of Arizona and Nevada, to the Sierra Nevada Mountains. He 
established a colony at the foot of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. He 
sent his pioneers and representatives across the Colorado River and es- 
tablished a colony in what afterwards became the state of Arizona. He 
asked for fully one-third of California. He asked in plain English for 
every drop of water that flows into the Hoover Dam. Please remember 
the name, never forget it. (Laughter.) Every drop of that water would 
have belonged to the State of Deseret. Los Angeles would have belonged 
to us. We established a great colony at San Bernardino and we estab- 
lished a colony way up in the northern part of Idaho, but the government 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



15 



of the United States, because of the lies of some run-away judges, sent 
the army of the United States against our people here and all those out- 
side colonies were abandoned. 

I am going to get another chance at you this afternoon and on 
several other occasions, and I see there are only a few minutes left. 

OFFICERS URGED TO KEEP COMMANDMENTS 

I want to leave with this vast audience my deep appreciation of all 
that has been said. I endorse it with all my heart, and I renew again 
everything that I said in the ten or fifteen minutes at the close of our 
Conference six months ago. I ask every man and woman occupying a 
place of responsibility whose duty it is to teach the Gospel of Jesus Christ 
to live it and to keep the commandments of God, so that their example 
will teach it ; and if they can not live it we will go on loving them, we 
will go on putting our arms around them, we will go on praying for 
them that they may become strong enough to live it. But unless they 
are able to live it we ask them to please step aside so that those who are 
living it can teach it. No man can teach the Gospel of Jesus Christ under 
the inspiration of the living God and with power from on high unless 
he is living it. He can go on as a member and we will pray for him, no 
matter how many years it may require, and we will never put a block in 
his way, because the Gospel is one of love and of forgiveness, but we 
want true men and women as our officers in the Priesthood and in the 
Relief Societies. And a man has no right to be in a high council who 
can not stand up and say that he knows the Gospel is true and that he 
is living it. 

May God help us to live the Gospel, that our light shall shine before 
those who know not the truth. I know as I know that I live that God 
lives, that he is my Father, that he hears and answers my prayers. I 
know that Jesus Christ is the Redeemer of mankind, the Son of the 
living God, my Elder Brother. I know that Joseph Smith is a prophet 
of the true and the living God, and that he was the instrument in the 
hands of God of again restoring to the earth the Gospel of Jesus Christ. 

May God bless you, one and all, and every honest man and woman 
that lives upon the face of the earth, is my humble prayer, and I ask it in 
humility in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem "Behold, God the Lord Passed By" 
(Elijah). 

Elder Stayner Richards, President of the Highland Stake, offered 
the benediction. 

Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock p. m.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



FIRST DAY 
AFTERNOON MEETING 

Conference reconvened promptly at 2 o'clock p. m. Sunday, April 3. 

Again the great Tabernacle auditorium and galleries were filled to 
capacity with people who had assembled to listen to the Conference pro- 
ceedings, and as was the case in the morning, the Assembly Hall was 
crowded with people and thousands of others congregated upon the Tab- 
ernacle grounds where, by means of amplifying equipment that had been 
installed, they were able to listen to the Conference services. 

The Tabernacle Choir furnished the music for this session. As an 
opening number the congregation joined with the Choir in singing "For 
the Strength of the Hills we Bless Thee." 

Elder Harvey Fletcher, President of the New York Stake, offered 
the invocation. 

"Onward Christian. Soldiers" (Sullivan-Nilson) was sung by the 
Choir.

PRESIDENT DAVID O. McKAY 

Second Counselor in the First Presidency 

Text: 

Wherefore, my beloved . . . work out your own salvation with fear 
and trembling. For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to 
do of his good pleasure. Do all things without murmurings and disputings : 
That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, 
in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as 
lights in the world. (Philippians 2:12-15.) 

Though given over nineteen centuries ago, Paul's admonition to 
the Philippians is applicable to us today. 

A TRYING PERIOD IN HISTORY 

Present day difficulties and perplexities call for individual as well 
as cooperative effort. To paraphrase Lord Nelson's famous statement : 
Now is the time for every man to accept responsibility and to do his duty. 

We are today living through one of the really crucial periods of the 
world's history, writes the Assistant Secretary of State. Everywhere 
about us is prodigious change. Old institutions, old beliefs, old ideals are 



PRESIDENT DAVID 0. McKAY

going fast. In this revolution of thought and life, new conceptions and 
beliefs born of Communism, of Fascism, of state totalitarianism, are com- 
peting relentlessly with the older conceptions which we thought were 
fundamental. The future is literally in our making. 

It is a time of disillusionment, of loss of faith, of bitter pessimism. 
We seem to be slipping backward in the long march of progress. We are 
in danger of losing part of the precious heritage for which our ancestors 
fought and gave their lives. Human liberty, democracy, parliamentary 
government, freedom of speech, freedom of conscience, tolerance, faith — 
these in important parts of the world have ceased to exist. Autocracy 
and dictatorship are demanding men's allegiance. Political institutions 
are cracking ominously. Democratic government is fighting for its life. 
Our whole capitalistic system is under fire. . . . 

Even today millions of men are wandering the streets of our great 
industrial cities, hungry and unable, through no fault of their own, to find 
work. We are still forced to mortgage unborn generations to care for 
present want. In the midst of abundance the world is multiplying poverty. 

RESULT OF REJECTING GOSPEL TEACHINGS 

Undoubtedly there are many causes contributing to these untoward 
conditions, chief of which is failure to adopt the teachings of Jesus. 

Certainly much of the hatred and animosity manifest among the 
peoples of the world are largely if not entirely due to men's rejecting 
fundamental principles of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Some men and 
some nations still apply the law of the jungle — cheat or be cheated, 
conquer or be conquered, kill or be killed — instead of "do unto others 
as you would have others do unto you," "love your neighbor as yourself," 
"do good to them who despitefully use you." 

Well, what can we do about it? Sometimes when we think how 
little we can do, we almost despair of attempting to do anything. But 
there are a few simple but fundamental things which everyone can do. 

One of these is for each individual to work out his own salvation. 

WORKING FOR SALVATION 

An outstanding doctrine of the Church is that each individual, 
carries this responsibility, and that the salvation of man is a process of 
gradual development. The Church does not accept the doctrine that a 
mere murmured belief in Jesus Christ is all that is essential to salvation. 
A man may say he believes but if he does nothing to make that belief 
or faith a moving power to do, to accomplish, to produce soul growth, 
his protestation will avail him nothing. "Work out your own salvation" 
is an exhortation to demonstrate by activity, by thoughtful obedient 
effort the reality of faith. But this must be done with "fear and trem- 
bling;" that is with a consciousness that absolute dependence upon self 
may produce pride and weakness that will bring failure. With "fear and 
trembling" we should seek the strength and grace of God for inspiration 
to obtain the final victory. 

However, to work out one's salvation is not to sit idly by,dreaming 
and yearning for God miraculously to thrust bounteous blessings into 
our laps. It is to perform daily, hourly, momentarily, if necessary, the 



18 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday, April 3 First Day 

immediate task or duty at hand, and to continue happily in such per- 
formance as the years come and go, leaving the fruits of such labors 
either to self or to others to be bestowed as a just and beneficent Father 
may determine. 

I am not unmindful of the scripture that declares "By grace are ye 
saved through faith, and that not of yourselves ; it is a gift of God." 
That is absolutely true, for man in his taking upon himself mortality 
was impotent to save himself. When left to grope in a natural state, 
he would have become, and did become "carnal, sensual and devilish 
by nature." But the Lord through His grace appeared to man, gave 
him the Gospel or eternal plan whereby he might rise above the carnal and 
selfish things of life and obtain spiritual perfection. 

But he must rise by his own efforts and he must walk by faith. 

He who would ascend the stairway leading upward to eternal life 
must tread it step by step from the base stone to the summit of its 
flight. Not a single stair can be missed, not one duty neglected if the 
climber would avoid danger and delay, and arrive with all safety and 
expedition at the topmost landing of the celestial exaltation. 

The responsibility is upon each individual to choose the path of 
righteousness, of faithfulness and duty to fellowmen. If he choose 
otherwise, and as a result meet failure, misery and death, he alone is to 
blame. As President Young said on one occasion : 

If Brother Brigham should take a wrong track and be shut out of 
the kingdom of heaven, no person will be to blame but Brother Brigham. 
I am the only being in heaven, earth, or hell, that can be blamed. 

This will equally apply to every Latter-day Saint. Salvation is an 
individual operation. I am the only person that can possibly save myself. 
When salvation is sent to me, I can reject or receive it. In receiving it, 
I yield implicit obedience and submission to its great Author throughout 
my life, and to those whom he shall appoint to instruct me ; in rejecting it, I 
follow the dictates of my own will in preference to the will of my Creator. 

I believe in individualism as opposed to paternalism. In saying this 
I recognize the fact that a man's duties to himself and to his fellowmen 
are indissolubly connected. Jesus taught that if a man is true to his own 
highest interests he cannot fail to discharge his obligations to his neigh- 
bors. Conversely, he taught, that if a man is faithful to the interests 
of his fellowmen, he cannot be faithless to his own. And as a man thinks 
so he acts. 

Within my experience there has never been a time when the doctrine 
of individual initiative and individual effort should be more generally 
taught and more earnestly put into effect than at the present day. 

Too many men are claiming that the world owes them a living, and 
are sitting effortlessly by expecting the world to throw its luxuries into 
their passive laps. Too late they will learn that the earth rewards richly 
only the strenuous stragglers. Emerson quotes someone as saying that 
"the world is in a state of bankruptcy; that the world owes the world 
more than the world can pay, and ought to go into chancery and be sold." 
Such reputed insolvency involves all the population, and he who does not 
get out and rustle for himself is a contributor to the alleged bankruptcy. 



PRESIDENT DAVID 0. McKAY

NO NEED FOR IDLENESS 

Thousands, through no fault of theirs, are out of jobs, and are 
vainly seeking a means of an independent livelihood. However, failure 
to find it is no justification for idleness. There are fences to rebuild, 
barns to repair, yards to clean up, houses to remodel and to paint, vicious 
and destructive weeds to destroy as they deface the highway and ravage 
crops. Instead of waiting expectantly for the government to find work 
for us, let us look around and see if there is not work near at hand. 
Such work will be a benefit not only to the individual but to the com- 
munity and the public generally. Last year there passed through Utah 
1,250,000 tourists. We must not shut our eyes to the fact that these 
hundreds of thousands of visitors constitute one of the greatest assets 
of the state. Travelers come to behold sublime canyons and far-famed 
scenery, to hear the story and see the accomplishments of the Mormon 
pioneers. If, when they come here, anticipation exceeds realization, 
these tourists will go away disappointed. If realization is greater than 
anticipation, they will depart with satisfaction and words of commenda- 
tion. 

Thriving villages with newly painted dwellings, cultivated farms 
and weedless highways, courtesy and fair dealing will bear an encouraging 
message to these hundreds of thousands of visitors ; while dilapidated 
houses, ill-kept gardens, broken gates and tumbled down fences will 
indicate an indolence and shiftlessness that will discredit the whole 
people. 

WHAT ONE WARD ACCOMPLISHED 

This admonition applies not only to persons but to the individual 
quorum, to the individual ward, to the individual stake. Look around 
you and you will find that there is work for you in your own community. 
These suggestions are not impractical effusions of a dreamer, as Bishop 
Lawrence B. Johnson of Randolph, Utah (Woodruff Stake) has re- 
cently demonstrated. In that little village, 10 or 12 more houses are 
needed to meet the bare necessities of natural increase in population. 
People have not the money with which to pay for these houses. But 
there are certain resources which they do possess — health, brawn and 
muscle, and initiative and foresight on the part of leaders. Twelve 
miles from this town are groves of timber; trees that can be hewn into 
house logs. 

Bishop Johnson presented his plan, and called for volunteers from 
the ranks of the unemployed. He anticipated meeting 5 or 6 men with 
teams and axes. At the appointed hour one Monday morning 20 men 
responded. 

With a little help a saw mill was obtained, and with the cooperation 
of the Forest Department, 200 trees, the forest life of which was about 
ended, had been transformed into excellent housing material — 25,000 
scale feet of logs made ready for use, and the work still continues. For 
their labor the men were given work receipts, which are accepted at the

regional storehouse in exchange for clothing, shoes, groceries and other 
necessities. 

Work brings happiness, and that happiness is doubled to him who 
initiates the work. 

OPPORTUNITIES AT HAND 

Too many of us fail to take advantage of opportunities near at 
hand. We justify inactivity by nursing the impotent thought that success 
cannot be obtained without influence, money, social or political "pull." 
Edward Rowland Sill gives an excellent illustration of the fact that 
sometimes "what one man throws away as useless, another man seizes 
as the best means of victory at hand." 

This I beheld, or dreamed it in a dream : — 

There spread a cloud of dust along a plain; 

And underneath the cloud, or in it, raged 

A furious battle, and men yelled, and swords 

Shocked upon swords and shields. A prince's banner 

Wavered, then staggered backward, hemmed by foes. 

A craven hung along the battle's edge, 

And thought, "Had I a sword of keener steel — 

That blue blade that the king's son bears — but this 

Blunt thing !" he snapt and flung it from his hand. 

And lowering crept away and left the field. 

Then came the king's son, wounded, sore bestead, 

And weaponless, and saw the broken sword, 

Hilt-buried in the dry and trodden sand, 

And ran and snatched it, and with battle-shout 

Lifted afresh he hewed his enemy down, 

And saved a great cause that heroic day. 

Writes Charles Wagner in the "Simple Life" : 

Each person's base of operations is the field of his immediate duty. 
Neglect this field, and all you undertake at a distance is compromised. 
First, then, be of your own country, your own city, your own home, your 
own church, your own work-shop ; then, if you can, set out from this to go 
beyond it. That is the plain and natural order, and a man must fortify 
himself with very bad reasons to arrive at reversing it. 

NEED AND VALUE OF COOPERATION 

Now do not misunderstand me. In thus emphasizing individual 
effort, I am not unmindful of the necessity of cooperation — 

There is a destiny which makes us brothers, 

None lives to self alone ; 
All that we send into the lives of others 

Come back into our own. 

A single, struggling individual may be stalled with his heavy load 
even as he begins to climb the hill before him. To reach the top unaided 
is an impossibility. With a little help from fellow-travelers, quorums, 
or wards he makes the grade and goes on his way in gratitude and 
rejoicing. 

This, I think, is in harmony with the teachings of Jesus, who 



ELDER STEPHEN L RICHARDS 



21 



"sought to perfect society, not by popular agitation or by re-organi- 
zation, but by perfecting the individual. He recognized the fatal fallacy 
in the dream of those who hoped to make a perfect state out of imperfect 
individuals. The ideal social state, which he described as the kingdom 
of God, is a commonwealth in which all men are united and governed 
by a commanding love both for God and for their neighbors." 

The present day turmoil and bitter strivings threaten to undermine 
basic foundations of Christian relationship. Liberty, freedom of speech, 
self-government, faith in God, and particularly faith in the efficacy of 
the Gospel of Jesus Christ are facing a bombardment from the ranks 
of error as the world has seldom if ever witnessed. 

SOMETHING FOR EACH TO DO 

Too many men quail under the impending onslaught, and cry 
vainly, "what can we do?" 
This, I repeat, we can do : 
First : 

By self effort attempt to initiate work around the home, and in 
the neighborhood, quorums and groups rendering necessary aid whenever 
possible ; and practice honesty ; speak well of your neighbors ; and if you 
cannot do this, say nothing. Seek the best in life, and thus give to your 
own soul and to your own environment a touch of the beautiful. 

Second : 

By proclaiming, and, what is even more effective, by exemplifying 
in life the principles of the Gospel of Jesus Christ as the only permanent 
panacea for the ills of mankind. 

Wherefore, my beloved, . . . work out your own salvation with fear 
and trembling. For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to 
do of his good pleasure. Do all things without murmurings and disputings : 
That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, 
in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine 
as lights in the world 

ELDER STEPHEN L RICHARDS 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

I wish to tell of a new interpretation of the Gospel of Christ. The 
occasion will permit only an outline but I make the attempt in the hope that 
our friends who listen and some of our members may come to a clearer 
understanding of the distinctive features of our message and our work. 
I use the word "new" interpretation rather than "true" for diplomatic 
reasons. "New" postulates "old" and while most people prefer to be 
modern rather than old-fashioned, usually no serious offense is given 
by placing a man in an old school of thought. Whereas, "true" assumes 
the "false" and everyone resents an imputation against the verity of his 
ideas. I make this admission frankly because I have no desire for 
debate. I merely want to explain. 




GENERAL CONFERENCE 



First Day 



Intelligence man's chief investiture 



I set forth as the first aspect of this new interpretation the doctrine 
of the dominance of intelligence. I believe I am correct in the assertion 
that in all Christian literature prior to the advent of our Church there 
were to be found no such concepts of the origin, function, and place of 
intelligence in the universe as come from our modern scripture. Here 
are some excerpts : 

Intelligence or the light of truth was not created or made, neither 
indeed can be. 

All truth is independent in that sphere in which God has placed it, 
to act for itself, as all intelligence also. Otherwise, there is no existence. 
(Doctrine and Covenants 93:29, 30.) 

The glory of God is intelligence — or in other words, light and truth. 

Light and truth forsake that evil one. (Doctrine and Covenants 
93:36, 37.) 

Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will 
rise with us in the resurrection. 

And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life 
through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much 
the advantage in the world to come. (Doctrine and Covenants 130:18, 19.) 

Now, since intelligence is co-eternal with God and is the very glory 
of God, it follows logically that it is the chief investiture of man. 
Indeed, it is man, for it is that part of his constituency that persists, that 
is eternal. This knowing, conceiving, illuminating principle of existence 
lies at the base of all our powers and potentialities. Without it there 
would be no virtue and no sin. It alone gives to man his free agency, 
the power to choose, to will, and to act, conscious of the effects of his 
decisions and his deeds. It accounts for the place of good and evil in the 
world and justifies their existence, — a philosophical problem that has 
baffled the minds and the thinking of great scholars, of all time. 

This conception of intelligence justifies the eternal quest for knowl- 
edge and it does more. It explains the necessity of acquiring knowledge 
for it makes knowledge essential to progression and progression in the 
last analysis is salvation. It places a terrific penalty on ignorance. It 
lays down a new and very definite gospel doctrine that : "It is impossible 
for a man to be saved in ignorance." (Doctrine and Covenants 131 :6.) 



The world in general and the modern world in particular with its 
science, scholasticism, and technology has been prone to scorn and slur 
religion and the church for an alleged backwardness and retardation 
in intellectual processes and in the acquisition of knowledge. Whatever 
justification there may have been in times past for such an imputation, 
I present now an interpretation of the Gospel that is a complete refuta- 
tion of these disparaging allegations and inferences of the secular world. 
The Gospel of Christ offers a stimulus and a reward in the pursuit 
of knowledge and the development of intelligence that transcend in their 
appeal and promise anything that the students and philosophers have 
ever evolved. 



true knowledge and intelligence rewarded 



ELDER STEPHEN L RICHARDS 



23 



But the knowledge and intelligence that it rewards must be true. 
"Light and truth" are the words of the revelation. It places no premium 
upon the acquisition of falsehood and error. It distinguishes very clearly 
between sophistication and true intelligence. A man once said in dis- 
tinguishing intelligence from education that intelligence is that which 
enables one to wisely meet the situations of life without education; 
whereas, education is that which helps one to meet the situations of 
life without intelligence. 

This statement may leave the inference that intelligence is largely 
inherited. The Gospel teaches us that it is — that it came as a native 
endowment of the race but that the efficacy of the endowment has been 
in many instances largely mitigated by the perversion of the race. It 
is encouraging and gratifying, however, to be assured that no man has 
ever quite lost this vital and all-important attribute. There is enough 
intelligence with every man to acquire knowledge and truth if he elects 
so to do. It is a significant fact, demonstrated by most extensive research 
and investigation, that there is no people in the earth, even the most 
primitive, which has not sufficient intelligence to grasp and hold to a con- 
ception of a God as a Supreme being. 

INTELLIGENCE A DIVINE ESSENCE 

How to exercise the intelligence we possess for the attainment and 
utilization of knowledge is a vital matter in the interpretation and appli- 
cation of the Gospel, but it is one that I must pass over briefly. The 
Gospel places highest value upon that intelligence and knowledge which 
contribute most to the enduring welfare of man. "Pure knowledge" 
it is called in the revelation, (Doctrine and Covenants 121 :42) which de- 
fines the attributes and functions of the holy Priesthood. This pure 
knowledge, without which the Priesthood can not properly be adminis- 
tered, contemplates an understanding of the divine plan of redemption 
and of the principles and laws that pertain to the celestial kingdom of our 
Father. In all the learning of the world there is nothing of higher import 
for the mind of man to comprehend than the eternal principles and truths 
that pertain to exaltation in the presence of God. And there is no higher 
order of intelligence than that which enables man to perceive these 
glorious truths. 

Since intelligence is a divine essence, it may function adequately 
only when recognized as divine. In that recognition faith is indispensable. 
Faith and knowledge constitute testimony and bring that conviction 
which is epitomized in the declaration, "that to know thee is eternal 
life." So I ask, where is the philosophy or school of thought that esteems 
more highly and ascribes nobler attributes to the mind and intelligence 
of man than does this exalted concept set forth in the new interpretation 
of the Gospel of Christ? 

THE FAMILY OF GOD 

I propose as the next major phase of this new interpretation a 
unique and distinctive conception of the family of God. God, the 



24 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday, April 3 First Day 

Master Intelligence is the Creator and veritable Father of his children, 
the lesser but potentially divine intelligences who make up his family 
and populate his kingdom. As a kindly parent, he desires and designs 
the eternal welfare and happiness of his offspring. In modern revela- 
tion his purpose is clarified as never before in recorded scripture. It 
is the glory of God to "bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of 
man." (Pearl of Great Price — Moses 1 :39.) And, "Men are that they 
might have joy." (Book of Mormon — II Nephi 2:25.) These are the 
sublime declarations revealed in latter days, forever banishing all doubt 
and uncertain speculation as to the place and purpose of man in the 
universe. 

In what does the joy of man consist? There are two things : first, 
an eternal progression in intelligence, knowledge and power that leads 
to perfection, even as Christ is perfect; and, second, companionship 
with God in his presence and in the presence of his Son. 

NEW CONCEPT OF HEAVEN 

This pronouncement of the purpose of our being, together with 
additional revelations, brings a new concept of heaven. By the per- 
fection of our lives we achieve joy and come into the presence of God. 
Where is he? He is in his own kingdom. Are there other kingdoms? 
Yes. And in that revealed knowledge we learn the truth about heaven. 
There are other kingdoms referred to but not fully explained by Saint 
Paul and also indicated in "the many mansions of my Father's house," 
spoken of by the Savior. 

These scriptures have been fully amplified by the new interpretation. 
Kingdoms of eternity have been defined. Laws that govern the various 
kingdoms have been set forth and entrance requirements stipulated. 
There are preferential places and conditions in the hereafter, as there 
are here. The highest and most desirable is the celestial kingdom 
of our Father. In that kingdom and only there do intelligences attain 
their highest state of perfection. Only there do we have assurance of 
the reunion of families and the perpetuation of family relationship and 
eternal increase. In that kingdom man may ultimately become divine. 

In the mercy of God other lesser kingdoms make provision for 
just compensation in the lives of men. But the lesser kingdoms are 
outshone by the celestial as the sun in its brightness and glory transcends 
the moon and the stars. 

Men attain these various kingdoms by the election and the work of 
their lives. We do not know all the conditions precedent to entrance 
into the lesser kingdoms but what is necessary to come into celestial 
glory has been definitely revealed. The principles and ordinances of 
the Gospel of Christ are the laws of that kingdom. Faith, repentance, 
baptism, the laying on of hands for the bestowal of the Holy Ghost, 
ordination to the Priesthood, — are all essential requirements. Why? 
Because God has stipulated them and because also they are consonant 
with the spirit, the purpose and glory of the kingdom. 



ELDER STEPHEN L RICHARDS 



25 



Is it necessary for one to be baptized to go to heaven ? That de- 
pends on the place in heaven to which one aspires. We have no knowl- 
edge as to whether it may be necessary for the lesser kingdoms, but 
we do know by revelation that it is absolutely essential for the heaven 
of the celestial kingdom of God. The scriptures give us to understand 
that through the general atonement of the Savior all mankind will be 
resurrected from the grave and come forth in a life hereafter but we 
know that the atonement itself is not adequate to place us in the celestial 
kingdom, in which respect we distinguish between the general salvation 
of the human family brought about by the Redeemer of the world and 
the exaltation of the individual accomplished by his own works and 
faithfulness, through the mediation of Christ. 

MISSION OF CHURCH FOR LIVING AND DEAD 

From this clearly defined sublime concept of heaven is devolved 
the mission of the Church which is : first, to disseminate knowledge of 
the celestial kingdom; and second, to assist in perfecting the lives of 
men so they may enter that kingdom. 

This mission of the Church, through the revealed justice of God, 
is extended not only to all the living but to the dead as well. It is not 
designed that the accident of death shall circumscribe the free agency 
of man to choose and attain his ultimate destiny. Since, however, it is 
in the plan that certain ceremonies and ordinances which are requisite for 
entrance into the celestial kingdom shall be performed in mortality, 
merciful provision has been made whereby the living may vicariously 
perform these ordinances for the dead. Hence our extensive temple 
work wherein all conditions essential for entrance into the celestial king- 
dom are complied with for both the living and the dead. 

I think of all Christian service vicarious work for the dead is the 
most Christ-like. It often entails great sacrifice. The beneficiary is not 
here, even to give thanks. It is true benevolence. 

NATURE AND NEED OF PRIESTHOOD 

As a concluding item in this new interpretation of the Gospel, I now 
present the doctrine of the holy Priesthood. Knowledge of God, his 
family and his kingdom, and reason also, assure us that we can not do 
his work and accomplish his purposes without a delegation of his power. 
The Priesthood is his commission to men. It holds the keys to his 
kingdom. The gates will not unlock without these keys. 

Not only is the Priesthood necessary for the kingdom hereafter, 
but it is essential in perfecting the lives of the people. This investiture 
of divine power in man is a boon to him who holds it and an inestimable 
blessing to others. I call it the perfect plan of service because it does 
for man the most vital and important things that can come into his life. 
It inducts him into the fold of Christ. It unites him in an eternal 
compact of marriage. It establishes the enduring bond in which his 



26 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday, April 3 First Day 

children are born. It leads him into celestial glory, the benediction 
of his life. 

The nature of this divine power is set forth in some of the most 
beautiful language of all scripture. I have not time to repeat it all. Here 
is but a sample : 

No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of 
the Priesthood, only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and 
meekness, and by love unfeigned; 

By kindness and pure knowledge, which shall greatly enlarge the 
soul without hypocrisy, and without guile — 

Reproving betimes with sharpness when moved upon by the Holy 
Ghost; then showing forth afterwards an increase of love toward him 
whom thou hast reproved, lest he esteem thee to be his enemy; 

That he may know that thy faithfulness is stronger than the cords 
of death. (Doctrine and Covenants 121 :41-44.) 

DIVINE POWER EXISTS IN EARTH TODAY 

Are we sure that this divine power exists in the earth today? We 
are. We have incontrovertible evidence of its derivation and validity. 
Its origin is not lost in the obscure antiquity of the past. It came to 
us in relatively recent time,- — within the memory of our fathers. Angelic 
ministers, in person, bestowed it and delivered the keys. The unequiv- 
ocal testimony of the witnesses is recorded and available. And the 
authenticity and genuineness of the power are attested, not only by 
accredited witnesses, but by what is equally, if not more important, the 
virtue and efficacy of the power itself. 

Our history is replete with instances and circumstances indicating 
the vitality and force of this precious endowment. So that, hundreds 
of thousands of honest men and women have positive conviction of the 
restoration of God's power in the earth and the establishment of his 
Church founded on that power. 

This, then, in brief, is the new interpretation and the new restoration 
of the pure Gospel of Jesus Christ. I call it new although it came a 
century ago and although hundreds of thousands have accepted it, because 
today, the great preponderance of all the populations of the earth have 
never heard of it and do not know that the glad tidings of great joy 
have been re-revealed in the last dispensation of the fulness of time 
for the exaltation and glory of man. 

In this new revelation, through God's chosen prophet, lies the hope 
of the world. When true intelligence shall banish error and superstition 
and the family of God shall be more than a theological conception; 
when men shall truly aspire to the highest heaven, and the duly con- 
stituted authority of God shall be recognized and esteemed, then,- — and 
not until then, — will the long-desired peace of Christ descend upon the 
nations. God grant the early coming of that day ! Amen. 



An anthem, "Lost in the Night" (Christiansen), was sung by the Choir. 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS

ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

Personally I can say that I have enjoyed very much the spirit and 
instruction, and the music of this Conference — all of which I can endorse 
most heartily. 

A FAITHFUL PEOPLE 

I have been made to feel thankful to be a member of the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which it is clear to my mind is in 
its ascendency in the earth today. I have thought of the faithfulness of 
this people, the like of which I doubt can be found anywhere else in 
the world. They have accepted the Gospel as one of sacrifice, of self- 
abnegation, and of service to God and to f ellowmen. They are working 
out their own salvation in fear and trembling. They pray for the 
Authorities of this Church, and the Lord answers their prayers. I do 
not know that we need consider the exceptions. 

The Authorities of the Church are praying for the people, and 
the Lord is blessing the members of his Church and those who are 
rendering service in the Church, assisting the Lord in the acomplishment 
of his work and purposes, looking to the saving of the souls of men, 
without monetary consideration, who are paying their tithes and their 
offerings, and answering calls of authority from the leaders of the 
Church to fill missions abroad, to labor in the Church at home. If 
these people are not well paid here upon the earth they have the assur- 
ance of a reward hereafter that will amply justify all the sacrifices 
which they may make here in the flesh. 

PURPOSE OF LIFE 

We are not here upon the earth, brethren and sisters, and friends, 
by chance, nor did we come to earth for the purpose of acquiring the 
wealth of this world or the praise and plaudits of men, or for our own 
personal aggrandizement, but we are here according to the plan of the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ, which was instituted in the councils of heaven 
before the world was. It involves the acceptance of certain principles 
and the receiving of certain ordinances, the keeping of the commandments 
*of the Lord, the obeying of his laws, and the rendering of service to 
one another, to our fellowmen. 

It is pure religion and undefiled to keep ourselves free from the sins 
of the world and to visit the widows and the fatherless in their affliction. 
To those who feed the hungry, clothe the naked and minister unto the 
needs of their fellowmen in unselfishness, their hearts going out with 
their alms, to such will the Lord say in the day of reckoning: "Come ye 
blessed of the Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the 
foundation of the world." 

But to those who have buttoned up their pockets, who have closed 
their hearts against the needs of their fellowmen, living entirely selfish 



28 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday, April 3 First Day 

lives, they may expect the words of the Judge of all : "Depart from me, 
ye cursed." 

We should in very deed lose our lives in the service to our God and 
to our fellowmen. The greatest service that we can render, the most 
helpful, to our fellowmen and to ourselves and to our God is helping men 
and women to find out the way of life and salvation, to know what sal- 
vation is, of what it consists, and how it may be attained, and to encourage 
them by teaching them the word and will of the Lord, to accept of the 
same, and to walk in newness of life in the path which is straight and 
narrow, and leads unto life everlasting. 

THE GOSPEL THE LAW FOR ALL MANKIND 

Hence we preach the Gospel at great expense, it is true, to the 
Church, but the souls of men and women cannot be valued in dollars 
and cents in the cost of effort. The Gospel which we have received 
is the law by which all mankind are in the end to be judged, and either 
condemned or justified according to merit. The scriptures tell us that 
before the law sin was in the world, but sin is not imputed where there 
is no law, and that where there is no law there is no judgment, and 
where there is no judgment there is no condemnation. That means 
that the law of the Gospel must be taught unto all men ; they are to have 
opportunity to exercise their judgment and their agency in accepting 
or rejecting it, and inasmuch as many of our Father's children — many 
millions of them — have lived upon this earth and passed on without a 
knowledge of the Gospel of Jesus Christ and its saving power, the Gospel 
must be taught to them in the spirit world. 

That is not a new doctrine, for Christ himself, as the scriptures 
teach us, while his body lay in the tomb went and preached to the spirits 
in prison, and so we believe that the faithful men and women of this 
Church, when they go beyond, will be engaged in that kind of work. 
There is no nobler work in which men or women can be employed than 
that of helping the unfortunate, those who are in spiritual darkness, to 
find the way to life eternal and encouraging them to walk therein. 

On the other side this work of preaching is going on too, but there 
are saving ordinances of the Gospel that all mankind must receive if they 
will be saved, and they are administered here upon the earth by those 
having authority. Most of the higher ordinances are administered only^ 
in the Temples of our God. To find out these our kindred ancestors by 
genealogical research, and to go into the Temples of the Lord and receive 
for them vicariously those saving ordinances is another responsibility 
that rests upon us as a people, than which there is no greater, and the 
blessings that we receive will be according to our faithfulness in the 
discharging of this responsibility. 

This is true religion and undefiled before the Lord. 

I do not know that comparisons would help any. I have been 
letting this thought run through my mind : Where in all this wide world 
can we find a people, a working people in their religion, in their church 
organizations, as we have it in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 



ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL

Saints? Where can we find a people who are making the sacrifices 
that this people are doing, who are doing the good that this people are 
doing? 

OUR RELIGION A POSITIVE ONE 

Mormonism, I think we were told by Bishop Cannon this morning, 
is a positive religion, and I say that which is in opposition to it is 
negative. If it were possible that the Latter-day Saints could be mistaken 
in their attitude that this religion of ours is a positive religion, that there 
are things that must be done and accomplished in order to attain salva- 
tion, principles to be accepted and ordinances to be received, service to 
be rendered such as the Latter-day Saints are rendering, I say if it were 
possible that we could be mistaken in this thing — for we will all know 
at some future time with regard to salvation and its requirements, 
when every knee shall bow and every tongue confess that Jesus is the 
Christ, if not before — we would be as well off as those who take the 
negative attitude toward religion. But if it proves that we are right — 
as I am sure it will — in our claims of the things necessary in order to 
obtain salvation, how much better off we will be than those who have 
been on the negative side. So we are on the safe side, and I thank God 
that I have the assurance that we are on the safe side so far as under- 
standing what salvation is and how it may be attained. 

I think so far as the practice of these things is concerned we are 
setting a worthy example to the world of mankind. I have no fear 
so far as that is concerned that that is the order of things. If only we 
could fulfil the law in an acceptable way as our Father's children, all 
will be well with us, there will be no disappointment, and that is the thing 
that we are here upon this earth to do, to make preparation for the life 
which is to come, which is eternal, so that when we go beyond there 
will be no reproach of having done things we ought not to have done, 
there will be no disappointment. We will enter into the rest and the 
glory that are prepared for the righteous of our Father's children. 

God bless this people for their faithfulness, their devotion to the 
work of the Lord, and may he reward all the members of this Church 
fully for every sacrifice that they make in this life, and if not in this 
life, in the life to come, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

At the suggestion of President Heber J. Grant, the Choir and con- 
gregation arose and sang "High on the Mountain Top." 

ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

The way you people look around and feel around, I am wondering 
if you think that I am old. (Laughter.) I am very glad that I am not so 
old as I feel. I am thankful nearly every minute that I am well. I am 
better informed about life than death. I appreciate more than I can 
express President Grant's kindness towards me in permitting me to

stand in this pulpit and declare humbly and prayerfully before God that 
Joseph Smith was a Prophet of God, that Jesus is the Christ, that God 
is our Father. If you take that from me, you have taken my whole 
life. 

I have been in the First Council of the Seventy over forty years, 
drifting along in the Council and receiving their instructions ; and I now 
happen to be the senior president of the First Council. These young 
brethren — I call them young because they are not so old as I am — have 
been wonderful, they have been so kind, so considerate, and so appre- 
ciative that I want to say to you good people, you Latter-day Saints, I 
have been rewarded. Right along I have received my reward and 
pension for every kind thing that I have done. 

I love God, and I love God because he is a God of love, because 
he is a God of kindness, a God of forgiveness, for he has provided an 
opportunity that with all our weaknesses we can repent. And if you 
take from me the joy, the happiness, the peace and forgiveness, for 
heaven's sake, what have I left ? I would not give you a nickle for the 
whole thing. I love this work. My brethren have been wonderfully 
good to me, and they have been patient. God knows that, or they never 
would have endured it, because I have said things that I was sorry I 
said, but I could not take them back. (Laughter). 

I have a book — I did not write it, thank the Lord — they call it 
/. Golden Kimball; it has been passed around. There are in it some- 
thing over fifty talks, not long talks but short ones, that I have handed 
over to the stenographer, and they have been printed. I am saying 
to you in all candor that I have read it, (it is about the only book I have 
read through) to find out what is said about me. 

My brother Elias, before his death three years ago, read that book 
and he said : "Golden, there are things in that book that God must 
have given to you." That is my testimony to you, my brethren and 
sisters, in conclusion, that the Lord in his kindness and love has given 
me inspiration at times. I have been moved upon to prophesy, and my 
prophecies have come true. I am testifying to you that I have adminis- 
tered to a great many sick people ; within a short time I have administered 
to three, four or five. 

A young married man who is not a Mormon took a fancy to me, 
and I went and administered to that young fellow. His stomach is 
punctured, he has been under the physicians' care — three, four or five 
physicians — in the Catholic hospital. That young man wanted me to 
administer to him. I blessed him. He sent for me again and I blessed 
him again. That young boy almost worships me; I hope he lives. 

I administered to a woman not so long ago who had a cancer. She 
said she was healed. Well, I have told all of them it is not I, it is God, 
it is God's faith. 

In conclusion: You good people learn to love God. But without 
faith what can you do? All of us can have faith, and without it we 
cannot accomplish a single thing. 



ELDER JOSEPH F. MERRILL 



31 



I pray the Lord to bless all you brethren, all you Authorities. My 
whole conclusion is God save the people, and God knows they do need 
salvation. 

My father, Heber C. Kimball, once was discouraged and he said: 
"I do not know whether any of you will be saved. If any of you are 
saved I will be more surprised than anybody else." 

The Lord bless you. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH F. MERRILL 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

CAMPAIGN AGAINST TOBACCO 

Nearly a year ago the First Presidency authorized the Council of 
Twelve to organize a campaign throughout the Church against the use 
of alcoholic beverages and tobacco. This was to be a project for all 
Priesthood quorums, both Melchizedek and Aaronic, which should be 
charged with the responsibility of keeping their own members free from 
using alcoholic beverages and tobacco and of assisting all others to do 
likewise. Further, the Presidency called upon the auxiliary organizations 
of the Church to cooperate with the Priesthood quorums in giving help 
to the campaign. 

When the revised Priesthood plan went into operation last January, 
every quorum was advised to begin working on the liquor-tobacco project. 
From then until now the campaign has been in process of developing 
and continues so. 

Everyone recognizes that this is a work that cannot be finished in 
a season or a year. For it is expected to reach every home in every 
ward of the Church and secure a favorable response to the objective of 
the campaign — win our people away from the use of liquor and tobacco. 

This of course will be a campaign of education, a conversion of the 
intellect, a winning of the heart and securing action by the will. Of 
necessity time will be required to do these things. Another reason why 
the campaign must continue beyond the limits of a single year is that 
boys and girls are growing up and while at the moment they are innocent 
and clean, efforts must continually be made to keep them so. Hence it 
is believed that the campaign should go forward on all feasible fronts 
and utilize every available means of reaching all the members of the 
Church, especially those living within reach of Priesthood quorums. 

Methods of doing this work most certainly require careful con- 
sideration. The objective desired is clear and easily understood. But 
no two persons are exactly alike ; their circumstances and environments 
differ and the ways of effectively reaching their hearts and wills must be 
determined by their individual condition and characteristics. Hence 
tact, resourcefulness, persistence, wisdom and good will must be factors 
of any and all successful methods.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



First Day 



EFFORTS TO BE CHARACTERIZED BY LOVE 

It is highly important, of course, that workers avoid giving any 
offense to those with whom they labor. Love and good will must char- 
acterize our efforts. Presumably all members of the Church would like 
to be free from the habits of liquor and tobacco, free from any desire 
to use these narcotics. An eminent scientist, internationally known, 
once remarked to your speaker as they sat at the banquet table that he 
would give $10,000 if he could stop smoking. "I have tried," he said, 
but tobacco has got me and I know it is killing me." Undoubtedly there 
are many habitual users in the Church who could quit only by making 
the most determined efforts. Aside from these there are many dabblers, 
persons who partake more or less for one or more of a great many 
reasons. But be they habituates or dabblers, if they are Church members, 
is it not well to assume that they would rather be non-users than users ? 
Must not our campaign be based upon this assumption? 

Certainly many of the addicts are fine people, good neighbors, good 
citizens and worthy of the friendship of their fellow religionists. But 
they have a weakness that some of us, thank the Lord, do not have. 
(I say this humbly, not boastfully.) Hence they need help, not con- 
demnation. But help will not be accepted by them if it is given offensively. 
And so I repeat, tact, good judgment and abundant love must character- 
ize successful efforts to win our people away from the use of liquor and 
tobacco, and to keep them away. 

Why do I say that presumably all Church members would like to 
be free of liquor and tobacco desires? Because they have a feeling or 
a faith of the divinity of this work. Every grown-up member knows 
about the Word of Wisdom, a revelation from God. No reasonable 
person wishes to go deliberately contrary to the "will of God." Certainly 
he would prefer not to do so. But the cravings and the weaknesses 
of the flesh and the temptations of Satan are responsible for many slips 
that the individual in his better moments is sorry for making. Herein 
lies an opening, a justification, for helpful efforts of his brethren and 
sisters. These efforts, be it remembered, are motivated wholly by a 
desire to render a needed service, to give encouragement and strength to 
him willing to receive them. 

The objective sought and the nature of the problem indicate in a 
general way the method of work that should be employed. In the last 
analysis the individual is our concern. It is he that we wish to be free 
from the use of liquor and tobacco. Hence we wish to secure a favorable 
reaction from him. This means that we must reach him personally rather 
than in mass. When every individual is free and clean the mass will 
be free and clean. Our method of work must be based upon this fact. 

To win our people away from the use of liquor and tobacco is 
certainly a praiseworthy objective, but can it be reached ? Yes, in time. 
But we are not so optimistic as to believe the goal can be reached in a 
few months or a year. But we are sure that rapid progress can be made 
by wise, persistent, united and Church-wide efforts. Our faith is based 
upon the worthiness and the righteousness of our cause. The good of 



ELDER JOSEPH F. MERRILL

human souls and the happiness of human lives are the stakes for which 
we strive. God being our helper we shall win the fight of all those who 
have a living faith in the divinity of this great latter-day work. And so 
far as they are concerned and in respect to these narcotics Satan will be 
bound. 

COST OF BREAKING WORD OF WISDOM 

If our people in the stakes and wards of the Church wei e now 
entirely non-users of the things prescribed in the Word of Wisdom — 
tea, coffee, liquor and tobacco — their economic condition would be vastly 
more favorable than it is, just as President Grant from this pulpit has 
many times pointed out. Were we not astonished to see the great size 
of official figures recently published of the cost during 1937 to the small 
State of Utah of alcoholic beverages and cigarettes? Somewhat more 
than $11,278,000 was paid by the relatively few people in this State. 
This was an average of more than $20.00 per capita for every soul that 
lives here. (We do not know how much of the total was paid by tourists. 
Certainly entirely too much was paid by our people.) Let it be re- 
membered these figures do not include amounts paid for cigars and other 
forms of tobacco outside of commercial cigarettes, nor for bootleg 
liquors, which amounts are in no wise inconsiderable. 

If to all of these amounts we add those paid for tea and coffee we 
will get a still clearer realization of the great impoverishment Utah is 
continually suffering by sending out amounts to buy these worse than 
needless things. For we all know none of these poisonous articles are 
produced by us. They constitute a continuous drain upon our economic 
resources. We complain of our high taxes, of the great cost of our 
educational system, of the heavy burden of our relief load, and of the 
crushing weight of our farm mortgages. But do we know that Utah 
pays for tea, coffee, liquor and tobacco more than half the amount 
she pays for all her taxes — school, city, county and state? That she 
pays more for these poisons than she does for our public schools, 
including the colleges and the University, and that they cost more 
than twice the amount of the relief load ? And that Utah's farm 
mortgages could be paid in about three years by the savings if all of 
us kept the Word of Wisdom? Then are we not ready to admit that 
President Grant was absolutely right when he declared that our people 
could be economically independent by observing the Word of Wisdom ? 

HEALTH AND WISDOM PROMISED 

But even so, would economic independence be our greatest gain, 
big as this would be? Listen. Experience teaches the practical truth 
of the declaration of Satan as recorded in Job, "All that a man hath will 
he give for his life." Is not health more to be prized than money ? The 
great promise the Lord has given the Saints for keeping the Word 
of Wisdom is stated in these words : 

And all Saints who remember to keep and do these sayings, walking 
in obedience to the commandments, shall receive health in their navel 



34 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday, April 3 First Day 

and marrow to their bones ; and shall find wisdom and great treasures of 
knowledge, even hidden treasures. . . . And I, the Lord, give unto them a 
promise, that the destroying angel shall pass by them, as the children of 
Israel, and not slay them. 

Health, wisdom, knowledge, freedom from the destroyer! Are 
not these of far greater value than money? But a beautiful thing is 
that when these come by reason of observing the commandments we 
also keep our money. 

A LIGHT UNTO THE WORLD 

But these values are not all. Still other wonderful blessings would 
follow observance. What could they be, do you ask? The answer is 
simple. In fact and very deed Zion would be as a light set upon a 
hill; and all the world would see its glorious gleam. Has the Church 
Security program set the Church upon a hill ? Yes, but the light of this 
program has not shone and cannot shine with the effulgent brilliance that 
would flow from Zion if all her people were strict observers of the Word 
of Wisdom. God would then fulfill his wonderful promises and the 
results would make the people stand out so prominently and so favorably 
that the sinful world would be forced to respect and admire them. By 
this means the Church would preach its doctrines with a speed and a 
success not yet dreamed of in its history. And who is there that can 
doubt it? 

Even bad and corrupt people admire virtue, honor, integrity and 
all the other qualities that lift men up on high planes of moral excellence. 
Suppose that all the world could see that here are a people that sincerely 
practice all the God-like virtues they preach. What would the wondrous 
result be ? Certainly the redemption of Zion would not long be delayed. 

Brethren and sisters, have we yet really come to know that there 
is everything to gain by keeping God's commandments? Why do we 
not keep them? Do not correct observation, reason and experience all 
teach us the value of keeping them? Why certainly, answers every 
member of the Church qualified to speak. 

EFFORT REQUIRED TO OVERCOME 

But in this connection let us remember that it takes a continual, 
determined effort to live the Gospel. Wherever the Saints are Satan 
is likely to be also. It is his purpose to handicap and, if possible, over- 
come the Saints. He and his helpers are not asleep on their jobs. 
They do not get weary as many of us appear to do. And so we are 
tempted all the time and, obviously, tempted in our most vulnerable 
spots, in our weakest places. We all know this. Further, we have short 
memories, sometimes very short, and frequently slip before we are aware 
that we are in danger of slipping. These are facts. I recall them to our 
memories not by way of excusing us for our slips and failures, but to 
remind us of the need of being ever on our guard. 



ELDER JOSEPH F. MERRILL 



35 



To live the Gospel requires positive action. Restful repose is a 
temptation of the Evil One. There is no excellence without labor, no 
reward without achievement, no blessing without fulfilling the conditions 
upon which the blessing is predicated. Granted, you say. Yes, and my 
urge is that we remember these sayings and continually apply them in 
our efforts to live the Gospel. 

And may I remind ourselves that it is not easy fully to observe 
the Word of Wisdom? Our lack of courage to stand against social 
customs, our vitiated and pampered appetities, our ignorance of all that 
the Word of Wisdom teaches and our lack of faith in the true word 
of the living God are one or more of the reasons why but few, if any, 
of us fully observe this divinely-given law of health. 

BOOK BY BROTHER AND SISTER WIDTSOE 

May I say this document contains "thou shalt" as well as "thou 
shalt not." Have many of us overlooked this important fact? To 
bring these things vividly to our attention was one reason why Brother 
and Sister Widtsoe wrote the valuable little book entitled, "The Word 
of Wisdom — A Modern Interpretation." To become acquainted with 
the "shalts" I urge a careful study of the second half of this book. 
There is now a general recognition of the fact by the experts on the 
subject that food is the chief factor in the maintenance of health. But 
the Lord has known this all the time. So early in the history of the 
Church he gave us his great law of health — the Word of Wisdom. In 
recent years scientific methods in the hands of able experts have con- 
firmed in great detail the truth of the teachings of this divine law. 

Since it is our unquestioned duty to maintain our health, using the 
means the Lord has placed in our hands to this end, we should be greatly 
interested and profited by making careful study of the positive aspects 
of the Word of Wisdom as they are set forth in this new book by 
Brother and Sister Widtsoe. The negative aspects have very properly 
heretofore claimed most of our attention. Let us now study the positive 
also. If we practice the teachings of this book — the shalls as well as 
the shall nots — the general health of our people will be greatly improved 
and, as indicated above, the fame of our people will become world-wide. 
The values involved are therefore so great that, as reasonable, responsible 
beings, is not our duty as clear as transparent crystal? When we fail, 
due to unavoidable ignorance, we may in a sense be in the position of 
those who have no law and therefore may not be judged by the law. 
But in this day and time no normal adult person need be without at 
least a fair knowledge of the fundamental facts of nutrition and of 
what to eat and what not to eat. These facts are clearly set forth in the 
little book of which I have spoken. These facts are also briefly indicated 
in the positive aspects of the Word of Wisdom, but they largely escaped 
our attention, at least we did not seem to appreciate their values until 
modern science emphasized them to us. 

And as matters now stand Latter-day Saints see clearly that Joseph 
Smith in the Word of Wisdom gave many facts to the world that even 



36 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Monday, April 4 Second Day 



men of science at the time knew but little or nothing about. How could 
he do this? Because the Lord revealed these things to him. He was 
in very deed a prophet of the living God. 

Brethren and sisters, let us sincerely turn unto the Lord and strive 
continually to live in harmony with his will in so far as we can learn 
what it is. In no other way can we fulfill the conditions necessary to 
insure his blessings upon this people and upon this land. The Lord 
himself has thus plainly spoken to us. 

Let us seek him for a desire and for strength to keep our ears open 
to hear and our hearts ready to respond to his teachings. Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

Elders George Albert Smith and Rufus K. Hardy have sent us a 
number of fine telegrams since they left. They are both in the enjoy- 
ment of splendid health and are being received with enthusiasm by the 
good people of the Pacific islands. They send their love and very best 
wishes not only to us but to all the people. 

Elder Richard R. Lyman is thoroughly enjoying his mission. He 
is doing a great work in Europe and sends his best wishes also. 

The Choir sang an anthem, "Worthy Is the Lamb." 
Elder Vernal C. Webb, President of the West Jordan Stake, offered 
the closing prayer 



SECOND DAY 
MORNING MEETING 

The third session of the Conference was held Monday morning, 
April 4, at 10 o'clock a. m., President Heber J. Grant presiding. 

The musical numbers for this session of the Conference were furn- 
ished by the Relief Society Singing Mothers, under the direction of Char- 
lotte O. Sackett 

The Choir and congregation sang the hymn, "Now Let Us Rejoice." 
Elder Joseph Williams, President of the Blackfoot Stake, offered 
the opening prayer. 

"The Lord's Prayer," (Forsyth-Dews) , was sung by the Singing 
Mothers. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

We appreciate very deeply indeed our Singing Mothers coming 
here this morning and furnishing us the music. The singing of oui 
good sisters is under the direction of Sister Charlotte O. Sackett. 



ELDER REED SMOOT

ELDER REED SMOOT 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

I feel grateful to my Heavenly Father for the privilege I have of 
attending this wonderful Conference of his Church. As I sat upon my 
seat during the sessions of the Conference of the Church yesterday I 
thought to myself : Is there another place in all the world where a 
congregation such as this gathers, with one thought in mind, with a 
devout faith in God our Eternal Father, and with all of the Priesthood, 
and with all of the joy that comes to him or her who serves the Lord, 
knowing that he has established his Church in this dispensation, and 
that we are members of that Church. 

USE OF CIGARET CONDEMNED 

We all have our faults, some more than others. I sometimes think 
that among the growing faults, of a few at least, of the members of our 
Church, is the use of tobacco. In a speech I delivered in the United 
States Senate on June 10, 1929, I called attention to the baneful effects 
of the use of tobacco, and particularly on the youth and womanhood of 
our nation. The reason I decided to deliver that speech was what I 
had witnessed, as to the use of tobacco by women, not only in Washing- 
ton, but wherever I went. 

At that time it was not so universal, I was going to say, but perhaps 
I had better modify that and say that the practice had not reached the 
length that it has today. In that speech I condemned the insidious 
cigaret advertising campaign that so often appears in the press of our 
nation, promoted by tobacco manufacturers and their interests, whose 
only god is profit, whose only thought is the balance sheet, and whose 
only principle is greed. And above all, I denounced the unconscionable, 
heartless, and destructive attempts to exploit the women and youth of 
our country. 

I saw a statement in a New York paper the other day, in which 
statistics were given regarding the use of tobacco and the amount that 
was consumed in the United States, and also the purposes for which it 
was used. I was dumbfounded when I noticed in that report that the 
women of this country are consuming or smoking a large part of all 
the cigarets that are manufactured and sold in our nation. 

I am going to try to learn if I can if that practice reaches beyond 
the shores of our own dear country. I wonder if the women of the world — 
I mean of the great countries of the world, the civilized countries — are 
using that dirty, nasty weed as much as are the women of our own dear 
United States. 

Years ago in the larger cities of our nation saloons nourished on 
the principal corners, but at that time no tobacco manufacturer had the 
temerity to cry to our women : "Smoke cigarets, they are good for you." 
The human appetite is a delicate mechanism, and the attempt to urge 



38 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Monday, April 4 Second Day 

that it be destroyed by the regular use of tobacco is essentially wicked. 
The number of cigarets manufactured in the United States in the year 
1913 was 13,000,247,891, and for the year 1928, 102 billion. During 
those thirteen years the use of cigarets in our own dear America had 
increased nearly 900%. The cost of our public schools, elementary, 
secondary, and collegiate, in the year 1926 was $2,255,251,557. The 
amount expended during that same year for tobacco was $2,087,000,000, 
or nearly as much as the United States spent for educational pur- 
poses on her children and men and women, in the primary schools, 
in the high schools, in the colleges, and wherever education was given. 
Is not this a sad picture ? And it seems to me, my brethren and sisters, 
that when it is called to the attention of the people, particularly our 
people, there should be a reformation. And if what I say here today 
brings about a reformation, small or large, I will thank my Heavenly 
Father for it. 

SCRIPTURAL PASSAGES 

I had prepared at my office some of the wonderful statements found 
in the Bible and other publications of a religious nature, and I took 
particular pains to copy some that appealed to me personally, and I think 
they ought to appeal to every honest man and woman in the world : 

Deliver my soul, O Lord, from lying lips, and from a deceitful 
tongue. (Psalms 120:2.) 

He that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life : but he that openeth wide 
his lips shall have destruction. (Proverbs 13:3.) 

Death and life are in the power of the tongue : and they that love it 
shall eat the fruit thereof. (Proverbs 18:21.) 

The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into the 
innermost parts of the belly. (Proverbs 18:8.) 

Who steals my purse steals trash, * * * but he who filches from me 
my good name robs me of that which not enriches him, and makes me 
poor indeed. (Shakespeare.) 

There are so many of them. I love to study them. I love to take 
the Bible and turn to the two pages that I have here of similar quotations, 
all beautiful in expression and Godlike in purpose. 

SAFETY IN LIVING THE GOSPEL 

My brethren and sisters, I thought yesterday as I sat upon this 
platform looking over that mass of men and women who believe in the 
revelations that God gave to the Prophet Joseph, who believe in all of 
our Articles of Faith (and there is no reason for mentioning them 
because you are all acquainted with them), I thought that if we live 
by these things and by the examples of the Authorities of the Church 
since its establishment by Joseph Smith the Prophet we shall not go 
very far wrong in this life. 

May God give us strength to live our religion, not only talk about 
it, but live it, and live it every day. If we do we shall never have any 



PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAWSON 



39 



regrets. And another thing, we shall win the respect of people not of our 
faith when they see we live what we preach. 

May God be with us with his Holy Spirit and bless our families 
and our loved ones ; may his Church grow and increase in numbers and 
in power, just as fast as our Heavenly Father sees that the people are 
qualified to carry on to greater heights. 

God bless us all, I ask in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAWSON 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

I have been on the anxious seat since Sunday morning, and now that 
I am standing on my feet I do not seem to get very much relief. I think 
we have had a marvelous Conference — one of the best in all that have 
gone before. The attendance has been very great. We could have used 
two Tabernacles the size of this to accommodate the people, but of course 
we have to do the best we can under the circumstances. 

My thoughts during the last day or two have been running along 
the line of President Grant's opening remarks, Brother Merrill's talk 
yesterday and the address given by Brother Smoot today. 

daniel's prediction 

In the early rise of the Church divine authority was given to Joseph 
Smith, a young man, through the ministration of angels, by which he was 
authorized to organize the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 
and this was done in conformity, apparently, with the great prediction 
made by Daniel the prophet centuries ago, that in the latter days the 
God of heaven would set up a kingdom which would never be thrown 
down or given to other people, but should stand forever. 

It seems to me that that was a very remarkable prediction. That 
kingdom did not have its commencement upon the earth, it came down 
from above, from the God of heaven. 

LAWS OF FINANCE AND HEALTH 

Early in our experience the Lord gave two very important laws 
to his Church. One might be designated, properly, as the law of finance, 
and the other the law of health. And following this many precious and 
great revelations were given to the Church through the Prophet Joseph 
Smith for its consolation and instruction, but I am prompted right now 
to go back and dwell for a few moments on those two great laws. 

One law — the law of finance — is known to the Church as the law 
of tithing, but it means the same thing. No church can prosper, or 
survive, without some such law as we have. 

The other law, designated as the law of health, is the Word of 
Wisdom, and this law applies particularly to the individual members 
of the Church. One law upholds the Church and the other law is given 
for the temporal salvation of the individual members thereof. 

When the Eighteenth Amendment was repealed, the States of the 



40 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Monday, April 4 Second Day 

Union spent very freely of their revenue for hard liquors and for beer, 
and, as we heard from Brother Smoot here today, vast quantities of 
tobacco were consumed at an enormous expense, and, sad to relate, our 
own beloved State of Utah was no exception to the rule. 

COST OF LIQUOR CONSUMED 

It appears, my brethren and sisters, that, as an example, in the year 
1937 hard liquor was consumed in the State of Utah to the amount of 
$4,047,000 in round numbers, and for beer, $4,535,000 in round numbers, 
and for cigarets, $2,687,000 — giving a total of $11,235,000 invested 
in these articles that I have mentioned, which articles, if used extensively, 
sap the very life and spirit of the children of men and work untold 
suffering and injury. These figures have been given to the people in the 
public press and were taken from the records of the State. The total, 
that I have given you does not include cigars and other forms of tobacco 
or bootleg liquor. I am sure it would be interesting to you to know 
what the actual purchasing power of $11,235,000 is. I can give you 
an example that will bring the matter pretty clearly before you. 

With $11,235,000, five temples, each costing $1,200,000, or a total 
of $6,000,000, could be constructed; forty meeting houses at $50,000 
each, making $2,000,000; one thousand homes of $3,000 each, making 
$3,000,000, and 470,867 paid names in temple work, which is $235,000, 
making a total, as I have said, of $11,235,000. 

It would also give employment to at least 9,750 men on the con- 
struction of these buildings alone, not counting those employed in steel 
mills, in mines, lumber industries and factories. A half -acre lot included 
with each of the above mentioned homes would insure the owner against 
hunger and want. To work in the temples and receive the remuneration 
of fifty cents per name would give our aged brethren and sisters a 
feeling of independence and self respect in addition to the joy and satis- 
faction they would experience in performing a work of that nature. 

The above sum of $11,235,000, if placed at 5% interest, would 
yield $56,162 per annum — enough to provide employment for twenty-six 
men at a wage of $6.00 a day, three hundred sixty-five days per year. 
This is simply a sample of what might be accomplished with the large 
sum of money that goes for the purchase of these forbidden things so 
far as the Latter-day Saints are concerned. 

FOREWARNED BY THE LORD 

The Lord perceived from the beginning that there was danger in 
the articles that are listed here, and so he gave a charge to his people ; he 
warned them and forewarned them of the danger. He knew what the 
danger was, but he did not point it out. It appeared to him sufficient 
that he should tell his people that strong drink is not good for the body, 
that it is not good to be used internally nor externally. It might* be 
used in some cases for the washing of the body, but should not be 
used internally ; and the Lord, pointing to tobacco, said it was not good 
for the use of man in any way, but could be used for sick cattle and 
otherwise if great care were taken. 



PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAWSON 



41 



How merciful and gracious is our Heavenly Father to give this 
word of caution and advice and counsel to his people at a time when 
the real danger in these articles was not widely known. But science has 
confirmed the Word of Wisdom to this people. We know now where 
the danger is. We know that in tobacco there is a deadly poison. The 
Lord did not mention that, but learned men of our day, great practitioners, 
make this statement, that nicotine in tobacco is a dangerous poison, and 
that a very little of it in concentrated form would actually destroy the 
life of a man or a woman. 

The Lord not only points out the evils connected with our living, but 
also points out things that would be good for us, and altogether this 
short revelation covers a wide range. It is truly a law of health and 
those who observe to keep this Word of Wisdom will realize a blessing 
from it. 

The law is not only of a temporal character but is also spiritual in 
its operation. 

BENEFITS FROM OBSERVING LAW OF TITHING 

And now in respect to the law of tithing let me say it is about the 
shortest revelation in the book of Doctrine and Covenants — just a few 
words only. But in those few words is expressed the mind and will of 
the Lord concerning the matter of finance as affecting his Church. I am 
safe in saying, my brethren and sisters, that if the Latter-day Saints as 
a Church and as a people would observe this law strictly and pay an honest 
tithing, there would be sufficient means in the hands of the Trustee-in- 
trust of the Church for every purpose and would cover all our expenses. 
The only danger, I think, would then be that this people would rapidly 
become wealthy in the things of the earth, and in that case we would 
do well to remember the solemn warning given the Nephites when they 
had all things in common. They increased in riches and in the fine things 
of the earth until it affected their lives and they became proud and high 
minded and separated themselves one from another into classes, and 
finally were destroyed by the spirit of rebellion and wickedness. 

Let me call your attention to this fact in closing, brethren and sisters : 
When we pay to the Lord his part of our revenue, which is 10%, he 
does not take it up into heaven. The tithing is turned over to his servants 
on earth and goes into the treasury or storehouse of the Lord and later it 
is dispensed again and comes back to the people of his Church. Thus we 
get it all anyhow and the Church has the benefit of the full amount, but 
10% the Lord claims and that should go into his storehouse. This is 
certainly an interesting phase of the payment of tithes. 

I wish to bear my testimony. I know without equivocation or mental 
reservation that this is the true Church of the Redeemer, the Church of 
Christ, the Firstborn, and that membership in this Church is very 
precious. We who have it must guard it very carefully, make every 
needful sacrifice and pay to the Lord what belongs to him, and in return 
his blessing will be given to us. God bless you, in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 



42 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Monday, April 4 Second Day 

An anthem "The Twenty-third Psalm", (Frank Schubert) was sung 
by the Singing Mothers. 

ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

I sincerely trust, my dear brethren and sisters, that I may make 
some contribution to this wonderful Conference, which I have enjoyed 
greatly. 

THE VISION NECESSARY 

It is written of old that where there is no vision, the people will 
perish. Our fathers had a vision of this work, that inspired them to 
leave their native homes, in the main in the old world countries. They 
crossed the plains with a distinct vision of an objective to obtain. We must 
not lose that vision or we shall perish. Whoever does lose that vision 
will naturally step aside and desert the great procession. The people 
will never lose the vision. Some may, but the majority will keep their 
eye upon the goal. 

AMERICA A CHOICE LAND 

I remember, years ago, being greatly impressed as I read a book 
written by an eminent authority, a Jew, Israel Zangwell, in which he 
called America the "melting pot of the nations." He saw coming to 
this land peoples of all other countries, and under our Constitution and 
our glorious privileges in America the mixing of the blood of the nations, 
providing a new race of people in the earth, the American, rich in 
physical strength, in beauty, in intelligence and leadership. 

I am sure he was right in offering his thought that America would 
provide a new race, produced under the most favorable circumstances 
that people have ever known in the earth, which are the conditions that 
obtain in America, the choice land — the old Book of Mormon prophets 
called it — choice above all other lands. 

When I think that today one-sixteenth of the world's population lives 
in these United States, and we have only one-seventeenth of the world's 
land, yet are producing almost one-half of the world's wealth, and there 
are no peoples in any other land, whether they be farmers, common 
laborers, or mechanics or artisans, whose average income is as high 
as the average income of the families of the United States, I repeat, 
it is a choice land. 

THE BLOOD OF ISRAEL 

But I am thinking of a superfine melting pot, if you please, that 
is going forward in America, wherein a very choice stock has been 
introduced, the blood of Israel, the children of the promise. You re- 
member the old prophets foreshadowed the scattering of Israel, how 
they should be sifted among the nations, and yet should be gathered 
again. 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 



43 



I read an article also some time ago in which the author, discussing 
the question — Are the Jews the chosen people of God? — granted that 
they had the right to expect the realization of all the promises offered 
to their father, Judah ; but, said he, "when they aspire to the realization 
of the great promises bestowed upon Judah's brother, Joseph, they 
aspire to that which does not belong to them." And then he concluded : 
"If only somewhere in the world today we could find the descendants 
of this Joseph, we would indeed find the chosen people of God." 

Have they been found? Yes. It has been the declaration of this 
people, for more than a hundred years, that the mission of this Church 
was to find the blood of Joseph, through Ephraim, sifted among the 
nations of the earth, and for more than a hundred years we have been 
finding them, one of a city, two of a family, one here and one there, even 
as the prophets said they would be found, at the cry : "Come out of her," 
(out of Babylon) "O ye, my people, that ye be not partakers of her 
plagues." We have been gathering them up from the nations of the 
earth. 

I read with interest the investigations of the British Israel move- 
ment, which seeks to establish the fact that the founders of the British 
Empire were these descendants of Joseph. They give some very good 
evidences, and it is not difficult for me to believe that this branch of Israel 
did play a conspicuous part in the founding of the British Empire; 
but when they have proven their case they will discover that while that 
blood was there a large part of it has left England and is here in America. 
They have lost it. It has come to its own, to the land of Joseph, for 
Joseph's branch would go over the wall (the ocean) to the utmost 
bounds of the everlasting hills. 

GATHERING PLACE IN WESTERN AMERICA 

This is the land of Joseph. Some twenty-eight thousand converts 
to the Church, in the hundred years of the preaching of the Gospel in 
England, have come into the fold in that land, and most of them have 
come to America. Also from the Scandinavian countries, from the 
central countries of Europe, from Germany and Holland and Switzer- 
land, they have come in great numbers. This choice stock has responded 
to the Gospel appeal, to the highest standards that have ever been offered 
to man, and they have been brought to America. 

They were not left, like many of the poorer emigrants, in the con- 
gested centers of the East, but by the devotion and self-sacrifice of our 
fathers they were brought into this western land, where the old prophets 
saw them. For in the last days the mountain of the Lord's house was 
to be established in the tops of the mountains, and all nations, or people 
of all nations, were to flow unto it. This is the place, and here we came, 
willingly, because we had to. So we are here, in the right place. 

And what for? To obtain the natural advantages of America? 
Yes, and to have some superior advantages, advantages of leadership. 
We have the protection and blessing that comes through the Constitution 
and the government of this country, through the wealth of the soil.

Monday, April 4 Second Day 



These are ours. And here we mingle and mix the blood of the nations, 
the choice blood of the nations, the descendants of Joseph producing here, 
for that is the purpose, the greatest race of men and women that have 
ever lived, under the most ideal conditions. And what for? Great are 
those objectives. 

TIMES OF THE GENTILES 

Our mission of gathering this branch of the house of Israel from 
the Gentile nations was to be accomplished during the "times of the 
Gentiles." One of our revelations says, that the generation that saw the 
light break forth would see the close of the times of the Gentiles. When 
that is accomplished then cometh the day for the rest of the house of 
Israel. We are not to be alone. You Latter-day Saints must prepare 
yourselves to become the saviors of all the rest of the house of Israel ; 
even as Joseph saved them long ago, you are to save them, and their day 
is dawning. 

GATHERING OF THE JEWS 

I look to the Jew. Notwithstanding all his distress and peril 
through the ages that have passed, he seems to be in another peril, and 
yet I see the hand of God in it. He was to go to his native land, to the 
land of promise for Judah, to the Holy Land, and they are going, though 
many of them are going as our fathers came west — willingly because 
they had to. Even Hitler is used as an instrument, in the hands of God, 
of driving them where the Lord wants them. 

Oh you, our half brothers, Oh, that I could speak to you and your 
hearts could feel it and know that God has not forsaken you ! Your 
hour is coming. Your deliverance is at hand. Do not complain, but 
be patient, and go where the Lord wants you, for he yet will redeem 
you. Your hour is dawning. Let there be no doubt about it. 

I would like our Jewish brethren to know that Moses has appeared 
in this generation and in the Kirtland Temple delivered the keys of the 
gathering of Israel to the Prophet Joseph Smith, and that an Apostle of 
this dispensation has blessed the land of Palestine for the return of the 
Jews. We are confident that this blessing will be realized. 

DESCENDANTS OF LEHI 

To the descendants of Father Lehi, who have suffered so long, 
for whom we received the precious record of the Book of Mormon,- — ■ 
it did not come to us for our sake, it was committed into our hands to 
hold in custody for these millions who are in Mexico, Central America 
and South America — their day must come. It is coming, and I see 
the hand of God preparing for their deliverance. But you, you must 
lead the way. 

LATTER-DAY SAINTS TO BE LEADERS 



The distresses that are in northern Europe, in Russia, are only the 
prelude to the day of deliverance, for great hosts of Israel, of other 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 



45 



tribes, are in that north land. Their day will come, but you must lead 
the way. Your mission is to be the redeemer and pilot and guide for 
these hosts of Israel. 

We also have a mission to prepare ourselves, through subscribing 
to the principles of this Gospel, to become the light of the world, the 
very salt of the earth, in a day when men will lose faith in God, and even 
the mission of Jesus Christ will be questioned. Your mission is, there- 
fore, to indeed arise and shine. We plead with you to subscribe to these 
Gospel standards, because they are the rules we must subscribe to, if we 
shall be worthy to come to live in the presence of God. 

A KING IN PROCESSION 

I was deeply impressed, at the funeral of the late King George of 
England, by an incident that happened when the kings of Europe came 
to do him homage. Among them was a European king who the night 
before had imbibed too much bad English whiskey. He was not on his 
feet and ready to join the procession the next morning, and an English 
masseur was sent to work with him and put him in condition. But he 
was not ready when finally the procession moved, and the English mas- 
seur was pressed to hold an unsteady king on his feet. A moving picture 
was taken of it, and in identifying these kings they could not discover 
which king this was, with his duffy hat on, with his sweater coat protrud- 
ing below his other coat, and a pair of white duck pants on. Then they 
found he was not a king at all, not fit to be with kings. He did not know 
the rules of the game, and had not the honor and the right. 

I said to myself : How many of us would be fit to walk with the kings 
and know their rules, their etiquette, their customs ? We would need a 
good deal of training to be a lady or a gentleman in the presence of an 
earthly king, and yet we aspire to come into the presence of the Great 
King! Surely not without preparation! That is what life is for; that 
is what this Gospel is for. 

THE STRAIT GATE AND THE NARROW WAY 

There came a time, in the mission of the Christ, when he saw great 
multitudes turn away from him, and he turned to his disciples and said : 
"Will you go also ?" And the answer : "It is pretty hard, the things you 
ask us to do, but thou hast the words of eternal life. We know that. 
Hard as it is, whither shall, we go ?" And then one of the disciples said : 
"If men have to subscribe to these requirements, are there then to be 
only a few who shall be saved?" And he answered them: "Strait is 
the gate and narrow is the way that leadeth to life." He meant life in 
the celestial kingdom, in the presence of God, "and few there be that 
find it ; but broad is the way and wide is the gate that leadeth to death" — 
the loss of that celestial exaltation — "and many there be who go in 
thereat." 

We have found the strait gate, the narrow way, the divine authority 
to pilot men and women in that way. All these things we ask of the 




GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Second Day 



Latter-day Saints, whether it be subscribing to the Word of Wisdom, 
the payment of their tithing, keeping themselves clean and undefiled 
from the world, are to fit and train and prepare ourselves to walk 
through the strait gate and the narrow way to that exaltation in the 
celestial kingdom of God. 



To learn how to live in the presence of the King, that is the mission 
of this Church in training and preparing men and women. It is the 
great goal and objective. It is not practicing self-denial just because we 
are asked to do it, but it is to prepare for eternal living and exaltation. 
When we do this we shall become the very light of the world. 

God help us to keep our eyes upon these great objectives, which 
we never shall reach unless we pay the price of subscribing to these 
requirements of the Gospel, and learning to like it and to live it and 
to find joy in it. 

God help us in the struggle. God keep before us ever the distant 
goal; give us the courage to rally our wayward, faltering ones — this is 
the mission for this Church, not to be like the world, but to become 
the light of the world — I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The Singing Mothers and the congregation sang the hymn, "God 
Moves in a Mysterious Way." 



I am very pleased, my brethren and sisters, that I am permitted 
to stand before you again, enjoying the measure of health and strength 
God has given unto me. He has been very kind to me in the matter of 
health and strength, for there have been very few occasions when I have 
been deprived of the privilege of doing my daily turn. 

However, there are other things for which I am equally thankful 
and grateful. Health and strength, so much as we value them, and the 
power to do, as important as it is, I think, by me, would be little appre- 
ciated if I did not have the wonderful associations and surroundings with 
which I am blessed. I believe that if I had to go off and work by 
myself, even though I might work from before daylight until after dark, 
I would get little joy and little pleasure and little profit out of it. 

My joy comes from the privilege of working with my fellows. I 
am truly thankful that my associates are numbered among the people of 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I am thankful that 
my grandfathers, on both sides of my house, saw fit to embrace the truth 
and come out of the world to the West, along with the membership of 
this great Church ; that they had a faith so true that it led them to pull 
up the stakes which they had driven so deeply, and start again in a new 
country. I thank the Lord that that faith remained with them and 



PREPARATION NEEDED

carried them through to the end of their lives, and I pray that God will 
so bless me that I may carry that faith in my heart every day that I live ; 
that I shall have a desire to serve Him in righteousness, as I know that 
I should. 

This is a troublous time and the world is sick. If we can read the* 
newspapers and rely upon what they tell us, the world is sick and needs 
a physician. Men are wondering what is wrong, arid how we can correct 
it. I believe that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has 
within it the power which, if it were applied to the world at large, 
would solve all those problems. 

I thank God that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is 
not a political organization ; that its members, in affairs ecclesiastical, are 
not torn by party politics ; that they have a common motive of union and 
unity of purpose which enables them to overcome the bickerings, the 
jealousies of politics. It will never be, perhaps, that the nations of the 
world will not be governed by politics, but I would that God might grant 
that those who determine the politics of those nations might be touched 
just a little in their hearts by his Spirit, that love and the interests of one's 
fellows might, in a tiny degree at least, supplant the avarice and the 
greed and the jealousies that dominate those organizations, so that the 
Spirit of God might enter in and might lead in the councils of government 
and committees which represent governments. If it could, it would be 
a simple matter to recognize the principles of truth and justice that un- 
derlie, or should underlie all government. I thank God that we have in 
this Church those basic principles. 

A man prominent in the philosophy of the world was invited 
recently to this State to talk to the people on the troubles of the day, 
and one thought that I got out of his talk was his definition of democracy. 
He undertook to tell us that democracy does not consist in a set of rules 
which provide for the election of representatives of the people, whom we 
name presidents and senators and representatives, but democracy is a 
condition of the heart ; democracy consists in the recognition, on the 
part of one person, of the rights of another, and the thought that the 
common good is the determining principle, or should be, in all govern- 
ment; that men who are placed in prominent positions to direct the 
destinies of people derive that right from the voice of the people. In 
other words, that the people is sovereign, and the ruler is the servant of 
the people. 

Our Lord and Master, Jesus Christ, taught that when he said : "He 
that is greatest among you shall be your servant." Verily this is true. 

Democracy is the underlying principle, when it comes to government 
in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and I have stood in 
this pulpit before and stressed the fact that that democracy is represented 
in the Priesthood of the Church of God. 

Another man was imported, just recently, to talk to us, a prominent 
man, an analyst, a student of the times, and he gave as his remedy for 
the ills of the present day an increase in faith. It was extremely gratify- 
ing to me to hear that man say that faith in God would cure our ills, and 
verily that also is true. I find that condition existing in this Church, and 



48 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Monday, April 4 Second Day 

I believe that this quality of faith is the purest and the best that can be 
found in the world. 

Give me a body of men and women who actually believe that they 
have a Father in Heaven, in whose likeness they are fashioned, who is 
actually in control of the destinies of men, and who has a real interest 
in the accomplishments of his people, and I will give you a people who 
are willing to go to the end of the road to serve that kind of a Father. 

That is the faith that exists in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints. We believe verily that when the Prophet Joseph Smith told 
the world that he had seen God, that God and Jesus Christ were similar 
beings, and that we are fashioned in their image, he told the truth. Jesus 
Christ told his followers he would build his church upon the revelation 
to them of that truth that Jesus was the Son of God. So long as we 
can keep uppermost in our hearts that testimony, can actually believe in 
God, our Heavenly Father, and sincerely believe as we do that we have 
been commissioned to serve his purposes in connection with mankind, we 
will serve him in righteousness, to the best of our ability. 

Now, there is perhaps too great a lack of service on the part of 
all of us. I wish that I could serve with greater fidelity the ideals that I 
have in this respect. I wish that I had a stronger and firmer faith in my 
own ability to remain firm to my present convictions to the end of my 
days. I have a faith that God will never desert us, that his promises are 
real and true, and if we can live up to that faith, and keep it ever bright 
and green in our hearts, so that it will be the motivating power in our 
lives, I have no question as to the ultimate result and end of our activities. 

I have faith in God. I have faith in my brethren who constitute 
the Church .of God, and in their wives and daughters, the women of this 
Church. I do not know but that the time may come when this body of 
people will be the nucleus around which this faith will have to crystallize 
itself to save the civilization of the world. 

Now, we have a great charge and a great duty. Let us prove true 
to it. Let us dedicate every day of our lives to the service of God and 
our fellow men, and he will bless us, — bless us beyond our anticipations, 
bless us with glories that are greater than the accumulation of riches, of 
many houses and many herds and many flocks. That this may be our 
happy lot, I pray, in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 

of the Council of the Twelve 

It is my desire, if the Lord approve, to discuss one of the best known 
principles of the Gospel. It is good at times to review that which we 
know well. I have in mind the doctrine that only when knowledge is 
properly used does it become serviceable in promoting human welfare. 

SORROWS AND JOYS MINGLED 

One hundred years ago, the Church, which was then operating in 
Ohio, and Missouri, was, as it were, on trial for its life. The year 1838 



ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 



49 



was a fateful one. Persecution raged until men's hearts failed them; 
trusted members of the Church, holding high positions, turned away 
from the Church and in some cases betrayed their brethren. But, at the 
same time noble spirits, were found to take the vacant places ; two men 
were then called to the apostleship, were later called to the Presidency of 
the Church ; unexampled acts of courage were performed by the Priest- 
hood; revelations of marvelous value were received by the Church. It 
was a year of sorrow and also of joy. 

OLIVER COWDERY AND DAVID WHITMER 

Perhaps the event of that troubled year which gave keenest sorrow 
was the loss of Oliver Cowdery and David Whitmer from the member- 
ship roll of the Church — two of the three original witnesses to the Book 
of Mormon, men held in high esteem by the Church. Oliver Cowdery 
was excommunicated, and for many years remained outside the Church, 
rather than to confess his error and repent. David Whitmer withdrew 
from the Church rather than to face trial upon the charges made against 
him. The absence from the councils of the Church of these fine men 
who had been so gloriously blessed by heaven was grieved by the whole 
Church membership. 

Though these men were no longer members of the Church, yet they 
always maintained the truth of their testimony as found in the Book of 
Mormon, and their belief in the divinity of the revelations given to Jo- 
seph Smith, the Prophet. Moreover, Oliver Cowdery, after some years, 
humbly entered the waters of baptism again, and was on his way to plead 
with David Whitmer to return to the Church, when death overtook him. 
both affirmed with their last breath the truth of their testimony regarding 
the Lord's latter-day work. Their knowledge of the truth of the restored 
Gospel did not leave them. 

Naturally the question arises : How could these men, both of whom 
had seen the angelic guardian of the plates from which the Book of Mor- 
mon was translated and the plates themselves, and one of whom in addi- 
tion had been privileged to have converse with heavenly beings, John the 
Baptist, Peter, James and John — how could such men so conduct them- 
selves as to endanger their Church membership or be content to remain 
outside the Church? They had knowledge, beyond that of other men, of 
the reality and divinity of the events which led to the organization of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 

The answer to the question is simple, well understood by all. These 
brethren did not use their knowledge in conformity with the order of the 
Church as set forth in the revelations of the Lord. That is, they entered 
forbidden paths; they did not obey the commandments of God. The 
practices of their lives did not correspond with their knowledge. 

KNOWLEDGE NOT ALL-SUFFICIENT 

This historical event within the Church is evidence of the fact that 
knowledge alone does not and cannot secure human happiness, or move a 




GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Second Day 



person towards salvation. If further evidence of the insufficiency of 
knowledge is needed, we may survey the great number of men of high 
intellectual attainment, who, because of their criminal acts, are found in 
the prisons of the world. Knowledge may become the pathway to evil 
when not applied as directed by the Gospel plan. 

True, we have been commanded to seek all knowledge ; the Lord has 
also said that "it is impossible to be saved in ignorance", and that "If a 
person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his 
diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage 
in the world to come." However, it is equally true that the gaining of 
knowledge is but a first necessary step in a progressive life. Knowledge 
must be quickened and made alive by proper use. 



This doctrine is made clear in sacred writ. Among the many great 
truths revealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith, none is more beloved by the 
Church than "The Glory of God is intelligence." The word intelligence, 
as used in common speech, means readiness in learning, quickness of 
mind. Its higher Gospel meaning is more profound. The intelligent 
man is he who seeks knowledge and uses it in accordance with the plan 
of the Lord for human good. This is implied in the revelation from 
which the quotation is made, for the full sentence reads, "The glory of 
God is intelligence, or in other words, light and truth." When men fol- 
low the light their knowledge will always be well used. 

Intelligence, then, becomes but another name for wisdom. In the 
language of mathematics we may say that knowledge, plus the proper 
use of knowledge, equals intelligence, or wisdom. In this sense intelli- 
gence becomes the goal of the successful life. Knowledge is one of the 
means by which such intelligence is attained; the use of knowledge is 
equally as important, for it gives life and direction to knowledge. The 
whole matter is much like faith and repentance — neither is complete with- 
out the other. When faith becomes active through repentance, man rises 
towards his God-like destiny. Faith itself, built upon human experience, 
conforming to God's will, is but a type of higher intelligence. Thus it 
often happens that a person of limited knowledge but who earnestly and 
prayerfully obeys the law, rises to a higher intelligence or wisdom, than 
one of vast Gospel learning who does not comply in his daily life with 
the requirements of the Gospel. Obedience to law is a mark of intelli- 
gence. 



The preeminence of wisdom in meeting the urgent needs of men and 
nations has been recognized throughout the ages. It was Solomon, the 
young king of Israel, who chose wisdom and knowledge from among all 
the gifts offered him by the Lord, and in return was blessed beyond 
measure. It was the statement of the Apostle James concerning the lack 
of wisdom that led the boy Joseph Smith into the grove where he re- 



INTELLIGENCE QUICKENS KNOWLEDGE 



WISDOM MAN'S GREAT NEED 



ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 



ceived his first great vision. The world's great need today, in the midst of 
man-made confusion and horror, is wisdom. Man is rich in knowledge, 
surpassing every earlier time on earth. He has harnessed the forces of 
nature until they are subservient to his every wish and whim. But he 
uses his new-found power as readily to destroy as to make well. That is 
not intelligence, that is unwisdom. Should the world resolve to seek wis- 
dom as it gains knowledge, the dawn of the hoped-for, longed-for era of 
peace would rise in the East. 

This thought may be applied to our every duty and task. He who 
knows the necessity and value of prayer and then does not commune with 
God in prayer is unwise, and to that degree unintelligent. Whoever 
learns the Word of Wisdom and does not practice it belongs to the same 
class. The man who cannot part with a tenth of his income for the Lord 
is unwise and in the Gospel sense is unintelligent. A great church se- 
curity program has been announced under divine inspiration. To fail to 
support this notable movement, which has come to remain with us, implies 
a failure to put knowledge into action — that is unwisdom. So with every 
other Gospel requirement. This principle impels the Church at great 
sacrifice to maintain its educational system, its auxiliaries, its Priesthood 
organizations, so that the secular knowledge taught in the schools of the 
land may be fitted actively by purposeful use in human lives, into the 
Lord's great plan of salvation, the only plan that leads to lasting human 
joy. 

DISOBEDIENCE IS SIN 

A sombre thought accompanies this doctrine. To possess knowledge, 
and not to use it, or not to use it properly, is a sin. The failure of the hu- 
man will to render obedience to God's law is not only unintelligent and 
unwise, it is sinful. On one occasion the Lord said to the Church, 
through the latter-day Prophet: "There are many who have been or- 
dained among you, whom I have called but few of them are chosen. They 
who are not chosen have sinned a very grievous sin, in that they are walk- 
ing in darkness at noon-day". Oliver Cowdery and David Whitmer 
were in the noon-day of knowledge, yet walked in darkness. Wisdom 
had departed from them. Therefore they were in sin. So may any man 
close his eyes in full sunlight and walk in darkness and commit a sin be- 
fore God. The nations of earth, sated with knowledge, in the full light 
of a Gospel dispensation, walk in darkness. Therefore, the wages of sin 
are theirs. Their wars and contentions are sinful before the Lord, and 
punishment will follow until they open their eyes to the light. 

The divine warning has been given : "If you keep not my command- 
ments, the love of the Father shall not continue with you, therefore ye 
shall walk in darkness." Obedience to law leads to intelligence and wis- 
dom and frees men from darkness and the charge of sin. 

RESPONSIBILITY COMES WITH KNOWLEDGE 

Latter-day Saints, who have received the greater knowledge, are un- 
der the heavier condemnation, if they fail to conform in their lives to the 



52 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Monday, April 4 Second Day 

revealed law. Besides, our responsibility is not for ourselves alone, but 
for the whole human race. Intelligence must garnish all that we do, else 
how can we fulfil our destiny, so well spoken in ancient days: "I will 
raise thee up for a blessing among many people." 

The joyful struggle of life must be, if we really hope for happiness, 
to live lives of knowledge, used as the Lord desires, with intelligence and 
wisdom. Every wise person will ask himself before every act, Does it 
conform to the law of the Lord? and at the close of each day, Have I 
lived intelligently and with wisdom as my guide ? Then, in full light we 
shall see clearly the path and the goal, and avoid the perils and terrors of 
darkness. 

May the Lord so help us to live, that in the full noon-day of Gospel 
light, we may never walk in darkness, but with wisdom perform the 
duties of our lives. 

ELDER FRANK EVANS 

President of the Eastern States Mission 

It is a rather long way up these stairs. It reminds me somewhat of 
life itself. As one seeks to reach the point of vantage he may put forth 
a great deal of effort, he may possibly meet some obstacles in the way, 
but it is when he reaches his point of vantage that his responsibilities 
really begin. 

I have been very happy here in contact with our leaders and those 
to whom we look for instruction and counsel, and I have been very happy 
in taking part in the fine spirit which has characterized this great Con- 
ference. 

Yesterday as I listened to that broadcast I had a feeling of personal 
gratitude toward those who are taking part. I think I have not talked 
with any person, either member or non-member of the Church in our 
mission who has mentioned our Church and its activities who has not 
referred to the broadcasts of our Tabernacle Choir, and in all cases they 
have had nothing to say except in the way of praise. I hope sometime 
they may hear the Singing Mothers. 

I was very happy too to listen to that fine declaration of principles 
given by Elder Bowen yesterday over the nation-wide broadcast. I 
realized that many thousand people whom we are trying to reach were 
listening in, and I know what they will say, those to whom I may speak 
of it. I know what their reaction will be, they will say, "If you preach 
principles and doctrines of that kind I want to know more of you." 

There are within the boundaries of that mission seventeen million 
people. There are twenty-two cities with over 100,000 inhabitants ; there 
are 800 cities of more than 2500 people, and there are seven million 
people in small villages, and on the 467,000 farms. I believe there is 
every kind of problem there in that area known to our country — econom- 
ic, social, religious. I believe that probably all of the religious denomi- 
nations within the country are represented in that great area, and we 
have contacted many of them. We find many fine, kindly, and well- 



ELDER FRANK EVANS 



S3 



disposed people, and our missionaries make many favorable contacts 
with them. 

It seems rather strange that we can expect that fewer than a hundred 
missionaries can reach with any degree of success at all such a vast 
multitude of people, but they have the promise of the Lord : 

You shall have my Spirit and my word, yea, the power of God unto the 
convincing of men. (Doctrine and Covenants 11 :21) 

For I will give you a mouth and wisdom which all your adversaries 
shall not be able to gainsay nor to resist. (Luke 21 : 15) 

In consequence they have gone forward and in the last calendar 
year they have visited in homes 166,000 people. They distributed 250,000 
pieces of literature; they held more than 36,500 meetings; they used 
the radio on hundreds of occasions, and they entertained and instructed 
people by the means of music, both vocal and instrumental. They are 
young men and women who are honest, true, chaste, benevolent, and 
who believe in doing good to all men. I am thankful to the fathers and 
mothers who have maintained real Latter-day Saint homes, for there 
is where these young men and women receive their training. They go 
into the mission field prepared and you do not find the stain of nicotine 
upon their hands, nor the odor of intoxicants in their breath. They have 
been taught correct principles, and if anyone has ever looked with any 
degree of cynicism upon the teachings of the Word of Wisdom, I wish 
they could have the example before them that we see in the mission field. 
I honor and thank those men and women who have persistently taught, 
who have had the courage and the inspiration to teach and to advise, and 
to keep before the people these important principles. 

The thought occurred to me yesterday that was expressed I think by 
Ruskin : 

When we build, let us think that we build forever. Let it not be only 
for present use or present delight ; let it be such work as our descendants 
will thank us for it. 

I do thank these brethren and sisters. As we lay stone on stone, 
let those stones be held sacred because our hands have touched them, and 
finally, when the work is done, may our descendants look upon it and say, 
"See, this our fathers built for us." 

I believe that the work of the Mission is blessed. I believe that 
we have had the blessings of the Lord. It is only those who are humble 
who dare undertake such important work. I pray always for humility 
to keep within me the spirit of thankfulness and the recognition of the 
great power which is over us and under which we work and do our ser- 
vice. I pray that the Lord will continue to bless us. I sincerely pray that 
His Spirit may be with us. 

In conclusion I must take time to mention one thing. My first intro- 
duction to the Mission, by the way, was in company with President Don 
B. Colton at Palmyra on the occasion of the summer conference. Many 
people have asked me, and they constantly ask me there, as to whether or 
not that great pageant, "America's Witness for Christ" is to be repeated 



54 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Monday, April 4 Second Day 

this year. I answer of course in the affirmative. It is to be repeated. 
The conference is to be held again. I think I received more inspiration 
there upon that occasion than in a like period at any other time in my 
life — to see the home of the Prophet, to attend those meetings in the 
Sacred Grove, to see the sacred drama, this great pageant upon the Hill 
Cumorah, and to witness those other scenes that are so historic and im- 
portant to us. I thought of the words which came to Moses, "The place 
on which thou standest is holy ground." 

Yes, the pageant will be repeated this year. The Conference will 
be held as usual. The Hill Cumorah is now listed on all the principal and 
official road-maps, and many, many thousands of people travel that way. 
I hope that many of the Saints from the West may enjoy this occasion 
with us. You have our heartiest invitation to be there. 

I thank the Lord for all his blessings, and pray for a continuance of 
the same, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

"How Lovely Are Thy Dwellings, O Lord" (Rheinberger), was 
sung by the Singing Mothers. 

The benediction was offered by Elder William A. Matheson, Presi- 
dent of the Chicago Stake. 

Conference adjourned until 2 p. m. 



SECOND DAY 
AFTERNOON MEETING 

Conference reconvened Monday afternoon, April 4, at 2 o'clock p. m. 

President Heber J. Grant, who presided, announced that the Relief 
Society Singing Mothers would furnish the musical numbers for this 
session. 

The congregation and the Singing Mothers sang the hymn, "Come, 
Come, Ye Saints." 

Elder Leslie V. Merrill, President of the Franklin Stake, offered the 
opening prayer. 

An anthem, "How Lovely Are The Messengers" (Mendelssohn), 
was sung by the Singing Mothers. 

ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 

of the First Council of the Seventy 

My mind and heart are filled with the many holy thoughts that have 
been expressed at the meetings of this Conference. I am always grateful 
when I have the opportunity of listening to the word of God as expressed 
by his servants. 

A passage of scripture, familiar to every one present, is that found 
in the book of James of the New Testament. It reads : 



ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 



55 



If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men 
liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him. 
But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. 

These are the words that had such a great influence on the life of the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, and as a result of his reading them, he went into 
the woods and prayed for wisdom and understanding, and God answered 
him by his very presence. 

A few days ago, we had a very distinguished visitor at the Univer- 
sity — Sir Herbert Ames. Versed as he is in world affairs, it was only 
recently that he had a personal interview with the famous dictator, 
Adolph Hitler of Germany. In a lecture before the students of the Uni- 
versity, he took for his subject : "Conditions in Germany Today". The 
picture he drew of Germany and the youth of that land was anything 
but encouraging. He told us that all boys above the age of twelve years 
are put under heavy drill every day, and are clothed with black shirts, the 
uniform for the youth as prescribed by the Hitler government. In the 
public schools, they learn how to give the Nazi sign. By the time the 
boys are eighteen years of age, they are ready to learn the military tactics 
of their country. Every boy then is given a musket, and until he is 
thirty-five years of age, the daily drill teaches him the science of warfare. 
In this manner, the slogan of the old military leader, Bismarck, is kept 
alive, which was, "Might makes Right". The youth of Germany are be- 
coming war-minded as never before. During the past hundred years 
Europe has been steeped in warfare. She has literally been "washed in 
blood." Today every European nation is preparing for war, except the 
smaller nations like Holland and Scandinavia. 

A thoughtful question was asked of the distinguished scholar by a 
student of affairs. It was : "What can we do to off-set the military-mind- 
edness of Europeans today?" It was a pointed question, and an interest- 
ing one. Have we not inherited the spirit of warfare from our ancestors 
who went forth to war to protect their homes, and then for conquest ? 
It seems that modern man inherits all the innate pugnacity and all the 
love of glory of his ancestors. Today the horrors of war become man's 
fascination. War is the "strong life," we are told, and "war taxes are 
the only ones that we do not hesitate to pay." 

Our ideals here in America are those that are far aloof from the 
ideals of conquest and loot. The ideal of American civic liberty has al- 
ways kept the Government from war for conquest. The Government of 
the United States has never gone to war except for the protection of her 
ideals and for the protection of her people. 

I do not speak as a Pacifist. The Latter-day Saints are not pacifists 
as that term is understood today. In the past, our people have protected 
the flag of their country, and our ancestors took their part in the Ameri- 
can Revolution, which resulted in the writing of the Constitution of the 
United States. The Latter-day Saints will always be found protecting 
the Constitution of this Government. 

What will off-set war? What will become the religious equivalent 
of war? As I have said, we have inherited the war-like type. Our an- 



56 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Monday, April 4 Second Day 

cestors have bred pugnacity into our bone and marrow. Let public opin- 
ion vote for war, nothing can stop or prevent our going to war. I believe 
that the Latter-day Saints have both the moral and religious equivalent 
of war. Should the noted British lecturer and statesman attend our 
Priesthood meeting this evening to be held in this famous old building, he 
would find ten thousand men disciplined for peace — disciplined in the 
principles of law and justice, love for all people, and for peace for all 
mankind. And then should all the brethren of the Priesthood gather 
here, there would easily be ten times ten thousand with the same dreams 
and ideals. These men are disciplined not for war, but for peace, for the 
love of mankind and God. What finer nucleus could one find for the 
moral and religious equivalent of war? It shows that the martial type 
of character can be bred without war. What is needed then is for 
us to inflame the civic temper, as in the past nations have inflamed the 
military temper. Should a stranger see the Priesthood assembled tonight, 
he would be convinced that this organized body of men is given to the 
ideal of the most peaceful of activities, namely, service for God. 

The only thing then that is going to overcome war and bring peace 
is man himself — man in the social and religious group, disciplining him- 
self in the ways of the Lord, disciplining his thought, purifying his 
heart, and uniting in one great plan of the Priesthood of God. This will 
be the moral and religious equivalent of war. 

Said the distinguished English stateman : "The people who prepare 
for war have a battle-cry." So we have a battle-cry. The cry is con- 
tained in these words: "If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God." 
Every soul has the right to ask for wisdom. And yet there are hundreds 
of "battle cries" for peace that might be sounded. May I propose an- 
other. In a few days the Easter Day will be celebrated in all Christen- 
dom. What nobler words could be taken for the regeneration of man 
and his purification than the words of St. Mark in his description of the 
resurrection of Jesus Christ our Lord? 

And when the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mo- 
ther of James, and Salome, had brought sweet spices that they might come 
and anoint him. 

And very early in the morning the first day of the week, they came unto 
the sepulchre at the rising of the sun. 

And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone 
from the door of the sepulchre? 

And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away; for 
it was very great. 

And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the 
right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted. 

And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted ; ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, 
which was crucified : he is risen ; he is not here ; Behold the place where 
they laid him. 

But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you 
into Galilee : there shall ye see him, as he said unto you. 

War is an evil thing, and the only way to fight evil is to adopt some 
divine plan of campaign, given to us in the religion of Jesus Christ our 
Lord. Overcome evil with good. This is the secret of the battle against 
wrong. Evil is potent because it has control of the hearts of men. 



ELDER DAVID A. SMITH

The Priesthood of God is the religious and moral equivalent of war, 
and we all pray in our hearts that this movement may grow until it fills the 
hearts of all people of the earth, for it will be the power for enduring 
peace. When this condition comes about, it will change everything. I 
can see the joy of women and little children some day, I can see cities 
and great spaces full of happiness, when war shall have ceased and the 
Kingdom of God has been established among men. 

It is Easter time. May we not fill our minds and hearts with the 
holier thoughts of thanksgiving and love for all mankind? May not the 
peace of our resurrected Savior fill the whole world with its light? We 
who labor for ideals which make for triumphant living have the resources 
of God on our side, and in this confidence it is possible for the ways of 
God to triumph. We must work and pray incessantly that his Kingdom 
may be established over all the earth. It is the illumination from on 
high that will awaken humanity to their divine worth and power. The 
light may be spreading slowly, but it is destined to find the hearts of all 
people. If any of us lack wisdom, let us ask of God. We will receive 
the divine answer. That the Lord may bless us all, I ask in his name. 
Amen. 

ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 

First Counselor in the Presiding Bishopric 

I am grateful that I live in this day in which the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ has been revealed in its fulness, which gives to us power and 
authority to labor in the Priesthood. When I think of conditions today 
as we see them, I recall the statement of Nephi as recorded in the Book 
of Mormon : "I have been born of goodly parents." It is a heritage 
to be born of goodly parents. 

I am grateful that in my youth I had neighbors who were kind to 
me and who were interested in me because I had goodly parents, and 
because those neighbors had in their own soul the spirit of the Gospel 
and a brotherly love and an understanding of the Gospel message. Be- 
cause of these, I was taught, as Nephi was taught, the things which pertain 
to God and our exaltation, and was encouraged to walk uprightly before 
the Lord. Through the quorums of the Priesthood, under the direction 
of wise men, I partook of blessings through passing on through all the 
grades of the Priesthood from Deacon to High Priest. In my youth 
the great honor came to me which I now bear, and I recall many early 
experiences in visiting in the stakes where I had the privilege of meeting 
your fathers — men whose heads were white, men who had seen the 
struggles of the Church from its beginning. They received me and the 
message I left with them in the spirit of love and kindness, and in depart- 
ing they heaped upon me their blessings. I am greatly blessed now as I 
go among the Saints, for I find the sons and grandsons of these men 
with whom I labored as a young man, laboring in the authority of the 
Priesthood, and having known their fathers, I have rejoiced in the oppor- 
tunity of laboring with them also in authority of the Priesthood. They, 



58 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Monday, April 4 Second Day 

too, have been born of goodly parents and are following in their fathers' 
footsteps. 

This morning at 8 :00 o'clock, nearly five hundred enthusiastic men 
met in Barratt Hall for the purpose of discussing ways and means by 
which the youth of Zion might be inspired and redeemed from the pitfalls 
and the dangers which confront them. We are living in a dangerous 
age, an age in which we need every protection. We need the kind con- 
sideration of each other ; we need the spirit of brotherly love, for without 
that the Spirit of God will not dwell with man. I am sure that those 
who are here will agree with me in that, and perhaps it is not necessary 
for me to repeat it, but with all the feeling of my soul I rejoice in the 
opportunity which comes to me of laboring for the youth of the Church. 

In the days of our fathers, the problems were not nearly so great 
for the youth of the Church as today. It seems to me, Satan has been 
turned loose. Every device that man has been able to discover to lead 
the boy away from the teachings of the Living God, has been brought 
forth and is being used to steal from our children their heritage. They 
are our heritage, and without them what is life worth ? What will it be 
hereafter? We have all been taught that the family relationship can be 
broken only through our failure to keep the commandments of the Lord. 
I cannot forget the teachings of my father. Sometimes they appeared 
to be severe, but they always came in a spirit of love and kindness. He 
continually reminded us that his salvation was at stake if we failed to 
uphold and live in harmony with his teachings, teachings which he had 
received from those who had authority to teach, and the inspiration 
which came through power and inspiration from God, in whom we 
all believe. 

I am grateful that I do believe in God, that he has spoken in this 
day and that we are privileged to labor in authority of his Priesthood ; 
that we have assurance and promise that through our faith and diligence 
in the performance of duty, we shall be redeemed and exalted in a glory 
of which we have no thought nor can we understand fully at this time. 
So, my brethren and sisters, I am happy to be associated in this day with 
men and women who fear God, men and women who are so living that 
they make it easier for me to live in harmony with these eternal prin- 
ciples. Now is the time when men who fear God must stand together 
to protect themselves from the evils that beset us on every side. 

I have been given a great responsibility, which came to me through 
the call of the First Presidency of this Church, the duties and responsi- 
bility of which are set forth by God, charging the Presiding Bishopric 
in a very positive manner to look after and watch over those who hold 
the Aaronic Priesthood. Brethren, we cannot do this alone. We want 
you to help and many are doing it. Let us not permit those holding the 
Aaronic Priesthood to develop habits which blind them and take away 
the light, and bring instead the darkness. Let us watch them day by 
day; let us help them to see the dangers, for it is much easier at that 
time than it is to bring them back after the spirit of the evil one has 



ELDER SAMUEL 0. BENNION 



59 



taken possession of them. Then sometimes it is too late. Let us labor 
together in a spirit of love and in all diligence. 

May the blessings of God rest upon all of us continually; may we 
walk in the light of the Gospel message and have strength and power 
to accomplish his purposes ; may we, who hold the Priesthood, not neglect 
the duty which rests upon us, for remember that it is our responsibility 
to save souls. Should we fail, we forfeit many blessings and we must 
answer for our neglect. 

May the Lord help us, that when the time comes that we are called 
to answer we shall be unafraid, having done our best, I pray in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER SAMUEL O. BENNION 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

My brethren and sisters, and friends, I am happy to be here to 
attend this Conference, and to listen to the many fine, inspirational 
remarks that have been made, and to the wonderful singing, both yester- 
day and today. These Singing Mothers have been an inspiration to all 
who are here. I wonder how many have counted the cost, and realize 
what it means for these singers and for our brethren from the mission 
fields to have come so far. And the same might be said of this entire con- 
gregation, because it is always a great sacrifice of the world's goods, 
for men and women to come great distances to attend these conferences. 
But out of it come great rewards and joyous privileges. 

Yesterday morning I thought I never had looked upon an audience 
that inspired me so much as that audience did. People were standing in 
the aisles until they were almost filled. When the congregation stood up 
to sing it looked like a solid sea of faces. I realized that the people are 
the leaders of the Church, to a very great extent. The majority of the 
men and women who are here this afternoon and who were here yesterday, 
are leaders of the Church. I was reminded of the passage of scrip- 
ture which records the promise the Lord gave to Abraham. He said : 

Now the Lord had shown unto me, Abraham, the intelligences that 
were organized before the world was; and among all these there were 
many of the noble and great ones ; 

And God saw these souls that they were good, and he stood in the 
midst of them, and he said : These I will make my rulers. 

Men and women who have a knowledge of the Gospel, who know 
what it means to have lived before they came into this world, who have 
taken a part in the plans of our Eternal Father, are brought face to 
face with the fact frequently that we are only continuing the plan 
that our Eternal Father taught us even before the foundation of this earth 
was laid. 

This great congregation represents leaders from many places, men 
and women of responsibility, who have leadership, and who have the 
authority to delegate leadership. They are blessed with initiative, and 
they have in their hearts a desire to help, individually, in the building 
up of the Church and Kingdom of our Eternal Father. As a result of 



60 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Monday, April 4 Second Day 

experience, men and women obtain knowledge, a knowledge of the 
mission that comes to them in mortality, why we are here, from whence 
came we, and what is our responsibility while we are in mortality. 
The Book of Mormon prophet Alma said : 

This is the day and the time for men to prepare to meet their God. 

In this great school of experience we find ourselves following the 
teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ, in this Church of God, here in this 
western land. Men who have received the Priesthood, and all who 
have a testimony of the faith, have no doubt at all in their minds concern- 
ing this work; they have a knowledge that the Lord lives, and that he 
has revealed himself anew to men and women in mortality, through his 
prophets, those whom he has selected to lead Israel. 

Thus we see fulfilled the blessings that our Eternal Father predicted 
when he showed Abraham these great men whom he would call his 
leaders. Especially do we speak of those in this dispensation whose 
leadership has given them much wisdom, whose faith in God has given 
them abundant knowledge, and who have been preserved to a great 
age. 

All of the leaders of the Church in this dispensation, whose lives have 
not been interrupted by the bullets of assassins, as were the Prophet 
and his brother Hyrum, have lived to an advanced age. They have been 
selected by the Lord from among the rank and file of the people, and 
have been given a training that has made them worthy to be entrusted 
with the responsibility of his Church. 

I think things do not happen by chance. I think they happen by 
appointment, under the plans of God. I think he governs and rules, and 
that he whispers to those who will listen to him. And to those who 
listen to him, and respond, he confides his Holy Spirit, and he gives 
them a power and a strength that is not of man, but comes from Him. 

I think the example of leadership that we have in the Church today, 
in these perilous times, is a witness to all that the Lord is at the helm, 
and that he does not make any mistakes. He has selected a man whom 
he has trained from his childhood, President Grant, a man who, in his 
personal experience, has witnessed the growth of this country and the 
peopling of it from the days of Brigham Young. His great experience 
in life has given him a wise use of knowledge that comes as the result of 
experience and faith and leadership. He has given to the children of 
men in this dispensation the incentive to work. He has followed the 
instruction that came to him, as it comes to all men, to labor early and 
late for the building up of the Church and kingdom of God. 

The power of example is a marvelous thing. It probably is stronger 
than precept. If this great body of men and women go back home 
again and set an example that is in harmony with the revelations of the 
Lord and the impressions they receive from time to time it will have 
much to do with the correcting of many of the misuses of our time that 
bring sin and sorrow to thousands of people. 

The leadership of our Eternal Father is in this great Church. 
His authority is here. I bear that testimony to this congregation, and 



ELDER WILLIAM W. SEEGMILLER 61 



to all who may hear my voice. I am delighted to be able to say that 
I know with absolute surety that this is the work of God, and that the 
plan of the Priesthood our Eternal Father established in the heavens 
above before this earth was made, is here in action in mortality, and 
that the men who stand at the head are his servants in very deed. 

If this testimony and example be one that restrains us from doing 
things that we ought not to do, and is taken home again, it will have its 
effect in all parts of the earth where our people live. I pray the Lord 
to bless and protect every man, that he may grow in the knowledge 
of his Redeemer, through faith in God, and through prayer and through 
work and labor, and I do it in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

The Singing Mothers sang the anthem "Holy Redeemer." 

ELDER WILLIAM W. SEEGMILLER 

President of the Western States Mission 

I am honored in having the privilege of representing the Western 
States Mission. We have only begun our missionary work, and have 
done nothing that is worthy of special attention, but we have been 
blessed by the sincere support and loyalty of eight thousand Saints in 
the Western States Mission, and whatever we have accomplished we 
attribute to their faith and loyalty. 

We have twenty-six Singing Mothers in this congregation. They 
traveled by rail, under agreement with the railroad that they should have 
a comfortable place to ride and a clean place to dine, where they would 
not be under the necessity of either breathing or eating tobacco. This 
agreement was rigidly lived up to, and we thank the officials of the 
D. & R. G. W. Railroad Company for their kindness and gentility. 

I have been blessed many times for the effort which I have made 
in attending this great Conference. I have been blessed ten-fold by 
the address that was made by Elder Albert E. Bowen yesterday, so 
replete with sound doctrine in church and civil government. I hope 
always to be able to endure sound doctrine. 

I believe as sincerely in the story of Joseph Smith, the coming forth 
of the Book of Mormon, and the history of Lehi and his family coming 
to America, as I believe that Columbus discovered America in his 
time. 

I am sure that the Gospel of Jesus Christ can be nothing else than 
true, because it embraces all truth, wherever found, no matter from 
whence its source. 

We hope to be able to acquit ourselves in honor, that we may be able 
to improve upon the splendid foundation and organization which our 
predecessors have handed over to us. If this can be our happy lot we 
will feel that we have not struggled and labored in vain. 

I bear testimony to the truthfulness of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, 
and I know every man and woman will be blessed who lives by its 
doctrines. That we may all so live, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 



62 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Monday, April 4 Second Day 

ELDER CARL F. EYRING 



President of the New England Mission 

My beloved brethren and sisters: I hope that I shall have the 
capacity to carry back to New England the inspiration and the spirit 
which I have found here as our prophets of the living God have spoken 
the true word. 

I bring to you greetings from fifty missionaries and one thou- 
sand members of the New England Mission. 

The missionaries — your sons and daughters — are well. They are 
learning day by day how better to present the message of the restored 
Gospel to our friends and investigators, and they are trying to be the 
kind of person this Gospel ideally produces. I appreciate their loyalty 
and your support. 

Through the help of the missionaries, and through the greater 
activity of local members, the branches of the mission are utilizing more 
and more of the complete Church program. When compared with the 
enriched programs which members of well organized and efficient stakes 
enjoy, the Saints in the mission field are indeed pioneers. It takes the 
sterling qualities of the pioneer to preside and lead in such branches 
and to remain loyal to such small and often socially heterogeneous 
groups. 

As an important objective, we are diligently seeking to produce in 
the mission the same complete program enjoyed in the stakes of Zion, 
in order that the Saints may have the opportunity for religious activities, 
and the friends and investigators may obtain a true picture and impression 
of the vitality of Mormonism as they attend our Church services. Then, 
too, your sons and daughters who seek employment in the cities within 
our mission, or who attend the many universities of New England, have 
the right, we think, to find branches which are on a par with the wards 
they leave at home. We fully sense that such a goal is difficult to 
achieve, but we also keenly sense that if our Church is to offer the 
privileges and opportunities so necessary to keep intelligent and dynamic 
youth interested in religion, we must do our best to offer the facilities 
and blessings of an efficient organization. These branches must not be 
too much below par, when judged in terms of the home stakes, if we 
are to expect such members to continue actively in church work. We 
are fully conscious of this responsibility. We could not claim success, 
even with great numbers entering the front door through baptism, if 
we were losing, through any fault of ours, our precious sons and daugh- 
ters through the back door of indifference. We pray that we may be 
faithful to our trust. Fortunately, the Church program which holds our 
sons and daughters also draws to us and holds the finest types of 
investigators. 

Through the program of the Boston branch and the facilities of 
the mission home, we offer to the students of the Universities in Cam- 
bridge and Boston and to the other members of the branch an enriched 
program which we believe is appreciated by all and which is fostering 



ELDER CARL F. EYRING 



63 



a fine loyalty to the Church and its teachings. In a similar manner, but 
with fewer facilities, the other branches are being strengthened. In 
this connection, we appreciate our lady missionaries. Without seeming 
to interfere with the local leadership of the Priesthood, they find ways 
and means of setting in operation an improved church program. We 
always place the lady missionaries where there is local leadership; their 
services are greatly appreciated. 

On the other hand, for the most part, the Elders are placed in new 
territory — on the firing line of missionary work, where their wisdom and 
courage is tested in new and discouraging situations. As you receive 
letters from your sons, you will often observe how discouragement 
changes to enthusiasm. The natives of New England are a cultured, 
and conservative people. One is not accepted with open arms on first 
meeting, but must prove oneself worthy of friendship. If one can thus 
prove oneself, breaking through what seems to be an aloofness, one may 
expect to make friendships which are strong and enduring. Not realizing 
this fact, missionaries become discouraged because of their failure to 
make friends easily and quickly. 

We teach our missionaries that conversion is a sacred process in 
which there is a very intimate relationship between God and the convert. 
The missionary simply leads the way to the conversion ; he prepares the 
ground and sows the Gospel seed. As he strives to do his work, he must 
understand thoroughly that before converts come investigators, before 
investigators come friends^ and before friends comes friendliness. In 
the New England Mission, then, the missionary tries by word and deed 
to prove himself worthy of bestowing and receiving friendship. Until 
the missionary catches fully the vision of such an approach to his work, 
he often becomes discouraged. But with this vision, strengthened with 
a few successes, and as a tolerant messenger of love and goodwill he finds 
the joy of seeking friends and becomes overjoyed in his work. And you 
and I detect a new spirit in his letters. 

Out of such an approach, our missionaries have found friends 
among persons from all walks of life. They speak before schools, his- 
torical societies, young people's groups at churches, fathers' and sons' 
banquets, and small groups in the homes of friends. Often they speak 
only of the settlement of the West, no theology being discussed, but the 
ground is thus prepared for the sowing of the seed in the lives of those 
who express a wish to hear the message of the restored Gospel. 

Out of such friendly relations, we find that the eyes of thinking 
men and women are upon us. Are we in fact different in a fine way? 
At the moment, they do not seem interested in the divinity of the 
restoration, but following the pragmatic test, "By their fruits ye shall 
know them," they are looking for the results which we achieve as a 
religious people. Thus, our missionaries are asked to describe our or- 
ganization, the nature of our economic system, our program for young 
people, our care of the human body, and so forth. Christianity, in too 
many places, has fallen into the decadent state of something to be talked 
about, but not to be lived. "Thus, if your perspective of Christianity 



64 

Monday, April 4 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Second Day 



produces results of great value," they would say, "then we are indeed 
interested in finding the power back of it." 

As the attitude of intolerance turns to friendly tolerance, we must 
be fully aware of the fact that our acts are before the bar of friendly 
evaluation. As we ask our friends of the world to investigate our 
religion, we are asking them to investigate us as its product. Surely 
you will loyally stand behind us — without your lives lived on the true 
Mormon pattern our message to the world may not be made articulate. 

In closing, may I suggest a number of resolutions which I offer, first 
to myself, then to my missionaries, and then to you ? 

We will demonstrate by our personal and community lives that 
Joseph Smith is a true prophet of God and has given us a true perspective 
of the teachings of our Lord and Master, Jesus Christ. 

We will preserve our uniqueness, never losing our savor by the 
compelling impulse to become respectable from the worldly point of view ; 
but always adding savor by the urge to become a respectable member of 
the Kingdom of God. 

We will be a light set upon a hill because we will be different — 
different in the sense that we will be more industrious and self-reliant, 
yet more truly our brother's keeper ; more honest in business, speech, 
and thought, yet more forgiving of those who steal, lie, or fail to think 
straight; more healthy in body and mind through adherence to God's 
health program, yet more helpful of those who in weakness have lost 
control of the appetite ; more diligent for personal perfection, yet more 
concerned with brotherly helpfulness; more nearly ideal members of 
the kingdom, yet more teachable and poor in spirit. 

God grant that we may lift high the light of true Christian living, 
and that the world seeing our good works will glorify our Father which 
is in heaven — through Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

In a revelation given to the Church, March 8, 1831, the Lord 
said this: 

But ye are commanded in all things to ask of God, who giveth 
liberally; and that which the Spirit testifies unto you, even so I would 
that ye should do in all holiness of heart, walking uprightly before me, 
considering the end of your salvation, doing all things with prayer and 
thanksgiving, that ye may not be seduced by evil spirits, or doctrines 
of devils, or the commandments of men; for some are of men, and others 
of devils. 

Wherefore, beware lest ye are deceived ; and that ye may not be 
deceived seek ye earnestly the best gifts, always remembering for what 
they are given. 

QUESTIONS CONCERNING PURPORTED REVELATIONS 



It seems that periodically it becomes necessary to call attention to 
the true order the Lord has given us in regard to revelation. During 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 65 

the past three or four months I have received a number of communica- 
tions, coming from various parts of the Church, asking if certain 
purported revelations or dreams or purported visions are reliable and 
have the endorsement of the Authorities of the Church. 

There have been individuals, from time to time, who have been 
invited to go into the wards, in the sacrament meetings, Priesthood 
classes, Sunday Schools and Mutual Improvement organizations, and 
at times, for their special benefit, cottage meetings have been held where 
they might come and relate remarkable visions or revelations claimed 
by these individuals to have been given to them. All this is wrong. 

KEY REVEALED TO DETERMINE TRUE REVELATION 

The Lord has given us, by revelation, a key that should be our guide 
in matters of this kind. In another revelation that was given to the 
Church as early as February in the year 1831, the Lord said this : 

But verily, verily, I say unto you, that none else shall he appointed 
unto this gift except it be through him; [speaking of the gift of revela- 
tion given to the Prophet Joseph Smith] for if it be taken from him he 
shall not have power except to appoint another in his stead. ■ 

And this shall be a law unto you, that ye receive not the teachings 
of any that shall come before you as revelations or commandments ; 

And this I give unto you that you may not be deceived, that you may 
know they are not of me. 

REVELATIONS GIVEN IN ACCORDANCE WITH LAW 

The Lord has promised us that he would give us revelation and com- 
mandments when necessary, and that is recorded in another of the 
revelations also given in the same year, 1831, on the seventh day of 
August. And in that revelation the Lord says, speaking of those who 
should come to Zion : 

And they shall also be crowned with blessings from above, yea, and 
with commandments not a few, and with revelations in their time — they 
that are faithful and diligent before me. 

Now, the Lord will give revelations to this Church, and he will 
give commandments to this Church from time to time, and as it is 
necessary, but always in accordance with his own law; and we do not 
have to run around and invite individuals who are without authority to 
relate unto us purported visions, or revelations or commandments, for 
the guidance of this people. 

Everything in the Church is done in order. Everything pertaining 
to the kingdom of God is in order, because it is obedient to law. 

JOSEPH SMITHES COMMENTS ON REVELATION 

In 1833 the Prophet Joseph Smith gave this counsel to the Church : 

I will inform you that it is contrary to the economy of God for any 
member of the Church, or any one, to receive instruction for those in 



66 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Monday, April 4 Second Day 

authority higher than themselves. Therefore you will see the impropriety 
of giving heed to them. But if any person have a vision or a visitation 
from a heavenly messenger, it must be for his own benefit and instruction, 
for the fundamental principles, government and doctrines of the Church 
are vested in the keys of the kingdom. 

Then on another occasion the Prophet gave this other counsel, as 
it occurs in the History of the Church : 

President Joseph Smith, Jr., addressed the assembly and said: 

The Melchizedek High Priesthood was no other than the Priesthood 
of the Son of God; that there are certain ordinances which belong to the 
Priesthood, from which flow certain results ; and the Presidents or 
Presidency are over the Church ; and revelations of the mind and will of 
God to the Church are to come through the Presidency. This is the 
order of heaven, and the power and privilege of this Priesthood. It is 
also the privilege of any officer in this Church to obtain revelations so 
far as relates to his particular calling and duty in the Church. All are 
bound by the principles of virtue and happiness, but one great privilege 
of the Priesthood is to obtain revelations 1 of the mind and will of God. 
It is also the privilege of the Melchizedek Priesthood to reprove, rebuke, 
and admonish, as well as to receive revelation. If the Church knew all 
the commandments, one-half they would condemn through prejudice 
and ignorance. 

A High Priest is a member of the same Melchizedek Priesthood with 
the Presidency, but not of the same power or authority in the Church. 
The Seventies are also members of the same Priesthood, are a sort of 
traveling council or Priesthood, and may preside over a church or 
churches, until a High Priest can be had. The Seventies are to be taken 
from the quorum of Elders, and are not to be High Priests. They are 
subject to the direction and dictation of the Twelve, who have the keys of 
the ministry. All are to preach the Gospel, by the power and influence 
of the Holy Ghost ; and no man can preach the Gospel without the Holy 
Ghost. 

Now, these passages, these statements from the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, I have presented to you so that you may know how to be gov- 
erned in regard to matters of this kind. If a man comes among the 
Latter-day Saints, professing to have received a vision or a revelation 
or a remarkable dream, and the Lord has given him such, he should 
keep it to himself. It is all out of order, in this Church, for somebody 
to invite him into a sacrament service to relate that to the Church, because 
the Lord will give his revelations in the proper way, to the one who is 
appointed to receive and dispense the word of God to the members of 
the Church. 

SPURIOUS REVELATIONS 

In the year 1918, at the October Conference, the last Conference 
at which President Joseph F. Smith spoke, I called attention to matters 
of this kind, and after I was through he arose and endorsed my remarks 
by saying what I am going to read to you now : 

Again I feel to say that it is an opportunity for me to say a few words. 
This wonderful, mysterious revelation that I have been said to have 
received a great many years ago, was given in French, and I never knew 
but two or three words of French in my life; consequently I could not

have been the originator of that revelation. I want you to understand 
that I have denied it, I suppose, a hundred times, when I have been 
inquired of about it. It was gotten up by some mysterious person who 
undertook to create a sensation and lay the responsibility upon me. I 
am not guilty. 

When the Lord reveals something to me I will consider the matter 
with my brethren, and when it becomes proper I will let it be known to 
the people, and not otherwise. 

The ridiculous story about the red horse, and the black horse, and 
the white horse, and a lot of trash that has been circulated about and 
printed and sent around as a great revelation given by the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, is a matter that was gotten up, I understand, some ten years after 
the death of the Prophet, by two of our brethren who put together some 
broken sentences from the Prophet that they had heard him utter from 
time to time, and formulated this so-called revelation out of it. It was 
never spoken by the Prophet in the manner in which they have it put 
forth. It is simply false; that is all there is to it. 

KNOW THE TRUTH 

Now, these stories of revelation, that are being circulated around, 
are of no consequence, except for rumor and silly talk by persons who 
have no authority. The fact of the matter is simply this : No man can 
enter into God's rest until he will absorb the truth, in so far that all 
error, all falsehood, all misunderstanding and misstatement he will be 
able to sift thoroughly and dissolve, and know that it is error, and not 
truth. 

When you know God's truth, when you enter into God's rest, you 
will not be hunting after revelations from Tom, Dick and Harry all 
over the world. You will not be following the will-o'-the-wisp of the 
vagaries of men and women who advance nonsense and their own ideas. 
When you know the truth you will abide in the truth, and the truth will 
make you free. It is only the truth that will free you from the errors 
of men and from the falsehoods and misrepresentations of the evil one, 
who lays in wait to deceive and to mislead the people of God from the 
paths of righteousness and truth. 

God bless you. Amen. 

ELDER RULON S. WELLS 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

The burning questions of good and evil constitute the most important 
problem that has ever confronted the children of men. There is no 
end to the variations in which this problem presents itself. There are 
so many manifestations of it that one is almost lost in a labyrinth of 
confusion. 

These questions are often asked: What is good and what is evil? 
What is sin? What is the cause of sin, and what is its cure? Vice, or 
gross immorality ! What is vice ? Listen to the poet : 

Vice is a monster of so frightful mien 
As, to be hated, needs but to be seen; 
Yet seen too oft, familiar with her face, 
We first endure, then pity, then embrace. 



68 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Monday, April 4 Second Day 

Many varied opinions are given in answer to these questions, and 
it is astonishing to see how much misinformation and wrong conceptions 
are entertained by those who attempt to answer. Even those who are 
trying to solve the problem of vice and how to deal with it are greatly 
confused in regard to the real causes that lie under all of these evil 
manifestations. 

We hear remarks like this, "that it is highly improbable that gam- 
bling, alcoholism, prostitution, drug addiction and other forms of vice 
can ever be stamped out." Among the reasons given the first is "the 
unchanging nature of human appetites" and that "as long as that shall 
remain there will be vice." 

It is rather disheartening to hear such things as this, especially when 
they further say that there will probably be no change — no appreciable 
change — in the next few millennia, or next few thousand years. 

How well do I remember my father's family prayer and the im- 
pressions made upon me in my childhood of the impending judgments 
which were about to be poured out upon the wicked and ungodly. Let 
me repeat a part of it as I recall it to my memory : 

Remember the young and rising generation. May they not wander 
into by and forbidden paths ; but may they walk in that straight and narrow 
way that leadeth unto life eternal. Hold them, as in the hollow of thy 
hand, that no harm or evil may befall them. Frustrate the plans and 
machinations of the evil and ungodly ; may they fail in all their evil under- 
takings ; may they be caught in their own snares, and fall into their own 
pits, which they set and dig at the feet of thy people. Hasten the day 
when sin and iniquity shall be banished from the face of the earth, and 
righteousness shall predominate and cover the earth, even as the waters 
cover the mighty deep. 

Well, that day is not yet come ; but I am still looking for it and 
feel now as I did then that it is at our very doors and still entertain 
the thought that I may yet live to see it for I am still quite young — only 
four score years and three. But, whether I live or not I feel quite sure 
we shall not have to wait for another three or four thousand years in 
order to witness that glorious day when Christ shall appear in the clouds 
of glory — when this earth shall be renewed and receive its paradisaical 
glory, and inaugurate the great millennial reign of peace — when sin and 
iniquity shall be banished from the earth, and truth and righteousness 
shall prevail and Satan shall be bound — that old serpent, called the devil 
who, with his angels, was cast out of heaven into the earth and has 
wrought great havoc among the children of men, but now shall be bound, 
and sin shall be no more. 

What absurd misconceptions men have of sin ! They blame it on 
human nature. When they make such statements as that, it is a libel 
against Deity. Human nature is not evil. Man has been fashioned and 
formed in the image of God, not only in his physical image, but in all 
of his divine attributes. There are no evil ones. Man possesses every 
one of them ; as a child of God he has inherited them from his divine 
parents. We are God-like — not sensual and devilish — by nature. 

This is fully explained in Section 20, verses 18, 19 and 20 of the 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS 



69 



Doctrine and Covenants, where it is stated that in the beginning God 
gave holy commandments unto men, but because they transgressed those 
holy commandments they have become sensual and devilish. 

It is true that men have become devilish and sensual through trans- 
gression, but they are not by nature so ; that is quite a different matter. 
By nature they are divine, formed and fashioned in the image of God, 
inheriting from him all of his divine attributes. God possesses those 
attributes fully developed — in their perfect form ; — mankind, the children 
of God, possess them in embryo and in very imperfect form, but with 
infinite potentialities for development, and in the course of our eternal 
progress there is opportunity that we may perfect them and become 
indeed like God — which is the divine purpose in our being here on earth. 
Then do not blame it upon human nature, for our appetites, our passions, 
and natural urges are divine and are all designed for our happiness and 
well-being, and only through transgression do they become evil — when 
perverted, distorted or corrupted. 

In considering the problem of sin, if we are to have proper under- 
standing there are some things that must be understood which are 
frequently lost sight of by those who undertake to discuss this vital and 
ever present subject. Let me explain : 

While it is true that these attributes may be developed to their 
divine perfection, it is also true that they may be perverted, distorted 
and counterfeited until they become vices, all depending upon the 
individual and his choice, in the exercise of his free agency — whether he 
chooses the good or the evil. In this conflict there are two influences 
that are brought to bear upon him. On the one hand "the spirit of 
Christ is given to every man that he may know good from evil." (Book of 
Mormon, Moroni 7:16.) This spirit is ever striving to lead us to 
God. And, on the other hand "that which is evil cometh from the devil, 
for the devil is an enemy unto God and fighteth against him continually, 
and inviteth and enticeth to sin and to do that which is evil continually." 
(Moroni 7:12) Thus, it will be seen that God is ever present to guard 
and protect us and deliver us from all evil. He is unchangeable for 
he has said : "I am the Lord, I change not." And then, too, Satan, with 
unrelenting zeal is endeavoring to carry out his evil purposes in leading 
men away from God and hence unto darkness and the bondage of sin, 
and "to do that which is evil continually." He shows no signs of 
reformation. The devil is absolutely incorrigible, and this is what the 
criminologists sometimes overlook and blame to "the unchanging nature 
of human appetites." 

Are God's purposes failing simply because sin and iniquity continue 
to exist among us ? Nay, not so. This is an individual fight against sin. 
The generations of men come and go and each generation and each indi- 
vidual member is in the position where he must act for himself and choose 
between good and evil. Some choose the good and some choose the evil. 
Some choose to walk in the "light" and others "love darkness rather 
than light because their deeds are evil" — and all shall be judged according 
to the deeds done in the body. 



70 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Monday, April 4 Second Day 

How could we be judged unless we had a knowledge of good and 
evil? If we had no knowledge of good and evil we could commit no 
sin. Without free agency we could commit no sin. The spirit of 
Christ is striving with the children of men always. That is the light 
of Christ that has been given to every man. "That is the true light 
that enlighteneth every man that cometh into the world." "If we walk 
in the light," we are told, "even as he is in the light, then have we 
fellowship, one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ cleanseth 
us from all sin." 

But, the devil came also, and his power and influence is manifest 
among us and we see how he has made havoc with many; but always 
because they would not hearken unto the voice of the Lord. We meet 
our adversary every day of our lives. We may not see him, nor his 
angels, for they kept not their first estate and have no bodies of flesh and 
bones. We may not see them with our natural eyes, but they are here. 
We feel their presence, and we know that we are in the midst of them. 

All evil comes from that source. Every temptation to do wrong, 
every allurement to sin, every departure from the will of God is in- 
spired by those evil spirits who are abroad in the world, seeking to draw 
men and women away from God. To hearken to the devil and his 
followers is sin. To draw nigh unto God is virtue. Drawing nigh to 
God is faith. Resisting the devil is repentance. Therefore: "Resist 
the devil and he will flee from you ; draw nigh unto God and he will draw 
nigh to you." These two principles then — faith and repentance — should 
be the governing principles of all human conduct whether in the Church 
or out of it. 

There is no virtue in doing good under compulsion and likewise 
there is no vice in doing evil under compulsion. And, furthermore, 
if we had no knowledge of good and evil, sin would be impossible. 
Where there is no law there can be no condemnation. We are only 
responsible for that which we do in the exercise of our free agency, and 
according to the light — or knowledge of good and evil, which has been 
given us. 

For this reason God has endowed us with these divine attributes 
and our problem is to develop these and all the others through obedience 
to the will of God and to reject the devil's substitutes or counterfeits. 

Let me enumerate a few of these divine attributes which our 
Heavenly Father has transmitted to his sons and daughters dwelling 
upon the earth and to indicate how they may become vices under di- 
abolical influences. Every virtue has its kindred vice. For example: 

1. Economy becomes stinginess. Some men think they are econom- 
ical when, as a matter of fact, they are only stingy. How I hate a stingy 
man. 

2. Self Esteem becomes egotism, a miserable substitute for a divine 
attribute. 

3. Pride becomes vanity. I think it must be vanity "that goeth 
before the fall." 

4. Fear is a divine attribute and must not be confused with coward- 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS 



71 



ice. "Be not afraid of the face of man, but fear God and keep his 
commandments." "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom." 
Even the Lord would fear to do evil. 

5. Acquisitiveness, or thrift — the faculty that enables one to acquire 
wealth ; but when perverted becomes greed and avarice, these soul destroy- 
ing vices — the love of money which we are told is the root of all evil. What 
will not men do when this divine attribute is perverted into greed and 
avarice — into the "love of money"? They will lie for it; they will cheat 
and misrepresent for it ; they will steal for it ; they will kill for it ; and 
thus it becomes the cause of all our strife and contention, our wars, 
and destroys the peace and happiness of mankind. 

6. Faith, a sublime and saving attribute of Deity. A minister, not 
orthodox however, once said to me : "There is one thing you have in your 
Church which I don't like." "And what is that?" I inquired. "That is 
what you call faith." "What's the matter with faith?" again I inquired. 
"Just think," he said, "to believe everything you hear." "But sir, you 
have mistaken faith for credulity. The Lord does not want us to believe 
everything we hear." What does the Lord want us to believe? "Believe 
on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved." 

7. Love — This is the greatest of all the divine attributes — sometimes 
it is called Charity — which is the pure love of Christ. The biggest 
thing in all the world. Even this, under diabolical influences becomes 
lust — the very embodiment of everything that is vile — the devil's counter- 
feit. The greater, the holier, purer and nobler the divine attribute may 
be — all the more contemptible, vile and degrading is the devil's counter- 
feit. 

Are there any virtues that may not be perverted or distorted? Any 
divine attributes that may not be corrupted? Any good thing whatever 
that some devil does not try to counterfeit? 

Our government issues currency in various denominations — one, 
two and five dollar bills, ten, twenty, fifty and one hundred dollar bills 
(at least so I've heard), and these are legal tender all over our broad 
land, and easily exchanged in foreign lands, but some devil will make 
counterfeits and palm them off for genuine. Our government also 
issues gold and silver coins in various denominations, but some devil 
will take a baser metal and gild it over with gold and palm it off for 
genuine, but they are all counterfeits. Then do not despise the pure 
gold of religion because the devil makes a counterfeit of it in hypocrisy. 
Beware of counterfeits, there are many, many false religions. There 
is only one that is genuine, namely, the religion of our Lord, the Gospel 
of Jesus Christ in its purity as restored to the earth in the day and age 
in which we live, through Joseph Smith, the Prophet. 

The trouble with many men is that they resist God and draw nigh 
unto the devil. Even many men of science say "We cannot admit God 
into our laboratories." Why not? Let me say to them: "When you 
close the front door, against God, automatically you open the back door 
and let the devil in." 

Let no man think that I disparage the scientists. Nothing could 



72 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Monday, April 4 Second Day 

be farther from the truth. Nor do I underestimate the wonderful 
achievements they have rendered and are now rendering in service to 
humanity. On the contrary — I glory in their achievements in bringing 
truth to light, and sincerely wish that success may crown their efforts 
even though I may discount some of their vague theories. 

Inasmuch as we are God's children, possessing his divine attributes, 
there is real meaning in the Savior's admonition : "Be ye therefore 
perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect." 

Let me now revert to the previous question, propounded at the 
beginning of my remarks. What is sin ? What is its cause and what 
is its cure? 

In what I have said I have endeavored to make answer to these 
questions. 

All this, however, suggests another question: What is the purpose 
of it all and why does the Lord permit this evil opposition? For a direct 
answer to this question, let me cite to you the following : 

And to bring about his eternal purposes in the end of man, after he 
had created our first parents, and the beasts of the field and the fowls of 
the air, and in fine, all things which are created, it must needs be that 
there was an opposition; even the forbidden fruit in opposition to the tree 
of life ; the one. being sweet and the other bitter. 

Wherefore, the Lord God gave unto man that he should act for him- 
self. Wherefore, man could not act for himself save it should be that 
he was enticed by the one or the other. (2nd Nephi 2:15, 16.) 

We have also seen the two opposing influences, the one the spirit 
of Christ leading and enticing us to partake of the fruit of the tree of 
life, thus leading us to God; and the other, the devil enticing men to 
partake of the forbidden fruit, thus leading us away from God and 
to our destruction. 

The divine purpose, therefore, is made plain : Our Heavenly Father 
like any natural father desires to bring us back into his presence, to dwell 
with him in his celestial kingdom throughout the endless ages of 
Eternity; but before this can be brought about we must be sanctified 
from all unrighteousness that we may be prepared for celestial glory. 
(See D. and C, Sec. 88:18) No unclean thing can enter there. 
Obedience to the Gospel of Jesus Christ is the necessary preparation, 
for in this provision is made for the remission of all our sins, "even 
though they be as scarlet, yet shall we be made as white as wool," washed 
clean in the blood of the Lamb of God. Now, therefore, here is the 
cure, a panacea for every ill: Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ whom 
God hath sent to atone for all our sins. Repent, for "except ye repent 
ye shall all likewise perish." And be baptized by immersion for the 
remission of your sins by one who is duly commissioned of Jesus Christ 
to perform that sacred ordinance, and receive the gift of the Holy Ghost 
by the laying on of hands by a duly authorized servant of God. 

This is God's plan — it is the only way. Let all men give heed and 
may the Lord add his blessing I humbly pray, in the name of our Lord 
and Savior, Jesus Christ. Amen.

ELDER BRYANT S. HINCKLEY 

President of the Northern States Mission 

It can never become commonplace and unimportant to speak in this 
pulpit. This is indeed a great responsibility. For two years I have been 
doing missionary work in the Northern States Mission. Distance seems 
to minimize your short-comings and imperfections and to magnify your 
virtues and your achievements. My brethren and sisters, deep in my soul 
I have great pride in the things you are doing and have done. 

During this Conference I have listened with pride and satisfaction to 
the eloquent discourses on the philisophy and doctrines underlying our 
great religion. This stimulates one's faith and inspires him, but these 
splendid doctrines are not accepted by those not of our faith ; they might 
argue about them, but there is one argument that stands forever un- 
answered and unanswerable — the argument of righteous behavior. If 
the President of this Church were to ask every man and woman under 
the sound of my voice, who are free from the use of tobacco to arise, 
there would be very few who would remain on their seats. If he were 
to ask those who are not addicted to the use of strong drink in any 
form to manifest it by arising, most of those who are here would arise. 
If he were to ask those who cherish their virtue as they do the "apple 
of their eye" to stand up, the response would be universal. Somehow 
the world appreciates a religion that carries over, that registers in the 
lives of its adherents. 

As years and experience come to me there filters into my soul the 
settled conviction that Mormonism has something that the world 
needs, that it cannot succeed without. I do not think the world will ever 
emerge from the difficulties which seem to engulf it until it discovers 
what that something is and lives by it. 

The state of Illinois is a part of my mission. Since childhood I have 
heard the story of Nauvoo, but of recent years I have had frequent 
opportunity to walk the quiet streets of that little village and to contrast 
it with what it was when the Saints lived there. There is something 
missing now, something is gone. One cannot look across the century 
and see what a small group of our people, stripped of their earthly 
possessions — without borrowed money or material assistance from the 
state or nation, were able to do with nothing but their strong hands and 
their faith in their leader and in their Creator, without feeling in his 
soul that the world ought to learn the lesson which they practiced. When 
they reached Illinois they did not spend their days mourning over their 
persecutions in Missouri, bitter as they were, but they girded their 
loins, forgot their troubles and compelled the uncultivated earth to yield 
them a subsistence. 

The people of this generation should learn the lessons demonstrated 
in our history, the lesson of self-reliance, of faith in themselves, and in 
the Almighty. Through our present efforts to perpetuate this spirit of 
self-reliance we have won a place in public favor never before enjoyed 
by us. We do not appreciate the prominence that we have won through

this effort. The world is coming to see us — to see how we do it. To 
use the common phrase — "We are on the spot" and every man who has 
a modicum of patriotism in his blood, who loves the Gospel and loves his 
people has an opportunity now to demonstrate it — not by facing flashing 
bayonets or enduring great physical hardships, but by the simple process 
of living his religion. If we have faith enough to do this we are destined 
to become the pride and glory of the earth. 

I know that Mormonism is true. I have known it all my life, but 
I never before saw so clearly its grandeur and its beauty. God bless 
you, my brethren and sisters, and may he help us all to preach the 
Gospel abroad by living it at home. We are moving forward and with 
the help of our Heavenly Father we will win. May this be our happy 
lot, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus — Amen.

THIRD DAY

In order to render moderate financial assistance to those who were 
engaged in small farming or business, and who did not have a bankable 
undertaking, the Co-operative Security Corporation was set up. This 
company has made a number of small loans (which are largely character 
loans) but has limited the amount it would lend to any person to at most 
a few hundred dollars. 

In addition to the foregoing, very large contributions have been 
made in produce of which no record was at the time made because the 
mechanics for keeping full records had not yet been perfected. 

Furthermore, there are no available records of the money value of 
the very great work done by Priesthood Quorums and by the Relief 
Society with and for individuals, in such matters as assistance in building 
homes, in planting gardens, making small home improvements and 
renovations, in making clothing, and many like activities. In some stakes 
the major part of the whole Welfare Program work has been of this 
sort. Some of the most valuable assistance has been rendered in this 
way. 

THE CHURCH UNEMPLOYMENT SITUATION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 1937, 

IS AS FOLLOWS 



Employable needing employment, Jan. 1, 1937 6,544 

Employable needing employment, Dec. 31, 1937 7,760 

Skilled workmen unemployed, Dec. 31, 1937 1,134 

Unskilled workmen unemployed, Dec. 31, 1937 6,525 

Heads of families needing employment 5,651 

Number employed during year 6,071 

Number of persons used on Church Work Projects during year.... 2,532 
Number of persons assisted by Bishops, Relief Society, and the 

General Committee agencies 44,440 



It should be understood that there are, in the aggregate, a con- 
siderable number of cases in which relief is being furnished to individual 
families both by the Church and by governmental agencies, through 
arrangements worked out between them. The -statistics hereinbefore 
given represent only the contributions made by the Church in such cases. 

The same principle operates in a considerable number of hospital 
cases, but the figures given herein represent only the Church contribution. 

The Church has not yet made any effort, or pretended to make any 
effort, to take its members from governmental work projects; it has 
merely urged those on such projects to do a full day's work for a day's 

pay- 
it should also be understood that Utah and adjacent areas have 
very large populations of non-members who in considerable part are 
engaged in the industries. The Church has made no effort to take care 
of these, leaving them to be cared for by other organizations and the 
government. 

While the Church Welfare Program aims of course to help those 
in need, its real purpose is not merely to substitute Church gratuities

rebuild the characters of its members and to promote and to foster the 
patriotic, civic, and spiritual qualities of the people.

ELDER ELIAS S. WOODRUFF 

President of the Central States Mission 

I wish I were more prepared, that I might give you a better report 
of the mission, but I am so thoroughly surprised that I suppose I will 
be like the minister we frequently tell about who left his sermon at home 
and told his congregation that they would have to bear with him that 
day since he must depend upon the Lord, but that he would be better 
prepared next time. 

It is a great inspiration to come to this Conference; to hear the 
voices of the servants of God, to mingle with the Saints and to sit in 
council and discuss the affairs of the Church as the mission presidents 
have the privilege of doing. I shall return to the mission with renewed 
vigor, faith and determination to discharge my duty as the presiding 
officer in that portion of the vineyard of the Lord. 

I am happy to be able to say to you that the work in the Central 
States Mission continues along in its progressive way. The Lord blesses 
our people in their gatherings, our meetings are better attended all the 



84 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Wednesday, April 6 Third Day 

time, and they grow constantly. I am sure that faith is increasing and 
the spirit of happiness, concord and peace generally pervades our gath- 
erings. 

I believe the people of that mission are trying to live their religion ; 
they pay their tithing very well — a little improvement each year over 
the past, nothing spectacular. They want to do the will of the Lord 
and they find pleasure in his service. We have the local people doing 
some missionary work similar to the stake missionaries. For instance, 
in Kansas City all the men holding the Priesthood, who respond, hold 
cottage meetings among the non-members of the Church within the 
vicinity of their homes, and they accomplish much, I am sure. In the 
summer time they help us with our street meetings, when these street 
meetings are being held in more than one neighborhood. 

The meeting houses of the mission are most of them in very good 
condition. We have respectable places in which to meet. We always 
have our wants and our needs, even as you do at home, but generally 
speaking I am safe in saying, and happy to say, that the work of the 
Lord is progressing in that mission. 

A great responsibility is laid upon those who receive the Priesthood. 
When missionaries volunteer to go into the mission field, they are no 
longer at liberty to "choose their lives and what they'll be," because 
they have already chosen to serve the Master, and covenanted that they 
will do their part in attempting to carry the Gospel message to those 
to whom they are sent. 

I believe that with very few exceptions the missionaries receive their 
calls with due respect and reverence, and do the very best they can, human 
weaknesses considered, to discharge their duty. They live together 
in harmony, peace, and good will, and if any of them do get out of 
harmony, the rest of them help them to get back in. There is a genuine 
feeling of brotherly love among the missionaries. If they become con- 
cerned about one of their brethren, they all try to help him into a better 
condition. 

I rejoice in the privileges we have. I rejoice in the leadership of 
the Church, in the kindness and gentleness of spirit that is manifested 
by the General Authorities of the Church in the discharge of their 
duty. Those who speak of them as being dictators simply do not under- 
stand ; do not know. I have never known such gentleness and kindness 
in my life as I have found in associating with these brethren in the 
limited opportunities that come to me to associate with them. I testify 
to you that the Spirit of the Lord inspires them and blesses them, and 
there is wisdom in their counsel. I have never yet made a mistake by 
observing the counsel that has been given to me by those who preside 
over me. 

May the Lord give us faith in his servants, faith to do what they 
ask us to do, for our own welfare and happiness, is my parting prayer, 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER JOHN H. TAYLOR

ELDER JOHN H. TAYLOR 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

I trust, my brethren and sisters, that I may have the blessings of 
the Lord with me while addressing you. 

The preaching of the Gospel has always been one of the major 
activities of the Church. The responsibility for this work rests on the 
Priesthood, especially on the Seventies, because of the nature of their 
calling to be special witnesses of the Lord in traveling among the people, 
both at home and abroad. This assignment to preach and teach will 
always be ours because the Lord has indicated that during the time that 
his people are upon the earth, all men and women shall have the oppor- 
tunity of understanding and accepting the Gospel of Jesus Christ. 

Before any punishment has been meted out to a people because of 
their disobedience or their lack of faithfulness, the Lord, in sending 
his servants to preach and teach among the people, has always given 
them an opportunity of repenting of their sins and of coming back to 
him. 

This missionary work has been in existence even from the time 
when Adam was placed upon the earth. It was given to him that he 
should preach and that he should teach his family that they should repent 
of their sins and do the things which ought to be done in order that they 
might find their way back into the presence of God. 

Perhaps at times we forget this obligation which rests upon us 
as heads of families. I believe that if we were more faithful we would 
feel the responsibility of teaching our boys and girls, praying with them, 
and bearing testimony to them of the truthfulness of the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ. We would then have greater influence with them and thus 
help them avoid many things which are contrary to the word of the Lord. 

When the Gospel has been upon the earth the Lord has indicated 
that his Priesthood shall preach and teach among the people. All 
through the early days down to the time of Christ prophets were assigned 
to this labor, to warn the people, and to entreat them to repent of their 
sins and come back and worship the Lord in order that they might not 
be destroyed. When the Christ came upon the earth he preached and 
taught among the people and chose disciples and chose Seventies that 
they might represent him in preaching and teaching. When the Christ 
was crucified and the work was given to the Apostles to preach and 
teach, they went out and even gave their lives that men and women might 
know this Gospel. 

When the Church was established in these latter days, missionaries 
were sent out under all kinds of circumstances and conditions. They 
went out when they were sick, they went out when they were poor, they 
went out in the days of persecution, in order to do something for the 
nations of the earth, that the people might not be destroyed or die without 
having the privilege of understanding the Gospel of Jesus Christ. This 
assignment has come down to us through all the days of the Church and 



86 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Wednesday, April 6 Third Day 

we are therefore still sending missionaries into the world to preach this 
wonderful Gospel so that men and women may not be lost. 

In recent years we have not only been doing this foreign missionary 
work, but the Church has established in the stakes of Zion the home 
mission work. The presidents of stakes and those associated with them 
have seen the value of this work, and they are assigning men and women 
to go among the people who are living in the stakes of Zion, but are not 
members, so that they might have an understanding of the plan of life 
and salvation as revealed to us through the Prophet Joseph Smith. 
Reports from the stakes indicate that because of the labors of the mission- 
aries, many of these people are accepting the Gospel and many members 
who have been inactive in their Church duties are coming back into 
Church service. 

Our mission in the stakes of Zion is of course to endeavor to 
convince men and women of the truthfulness of the Gospel. We also 
have another mission, — that of bringing to the attention of our good 
friends and neighbors the real value of many of the principles of the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ. As they live among us they have not acquainted 
themselves with many of the truths that we have in the Church. They 
know something about the Word of Wisdom ; they know a little about 
the Temple work ; they know something about how we care for the needs 
of our young people, — but the majority of the principles of the Gospel 
of Jesus Christ have not been explained to them. 

While we have no hope of getting everybody that we contact to 
come into the Church, we do have the hope, the prayer and the desire 
to acquaint them with the Gospel of Jesus Christ so that if they move 
away they can carry with them a correct knowledge and understanding 
of why we worship God and a correct conception of our religion. 

Just recently I boarded the train at Salt Lake City with a number 
of other people. Among them was a young lady who, soon after being 
seated, was approached by fellow passengers for information concerning 
the Mormon people. As they talked with this young lady they soon 
found that she was not a member of the Church and that she had been 
going to school at the University. She had had some contact with the 
Mormon people, especially with the boys and girls. 

Practically the only thing that she could tell about the Mormon 
people was that they had a doctrine in the Church called the Word of 
Wisdom and because of it none of the people of the Church smoked 
or drank. Of course that was good information. Then she qualified 
it in a minute or two and said the older people do not drink or smoke 
but some of the young people do. When she had finished telling what 
little she knew about the Church she said: "Well, after all is said and 
done, the Mormon people are a very fine, splendid people." 

As I sat in my seat and listened to her vague ideas regarding the 
doctrines of the Church I thought of the splendid opportunities we have 
in Salt Lake City and all of our towns where our stakes are organized, 
to go to these fine friends of ours and help them to understand what 
we really believe. We all ought to be missionaries and help our neighbors

and friends to understand the principles of the Gospel and perhaps 
this understanding will gradually grow and increase until they shall 
become well informed regarding the things we have in the Church. 

May the Lord bless us and help us to keep his commandments 
and to do the things we ought to do. May we be a good example to the 
people who live among us. May the Lord bless the missionaries in the 
stakes of Zion so that they will know how to approach people in such a 
humble and intelligent way that they shall be convinced that this is indeed 
the Church of Jesus Christ. May the Lord bless us and help us in 
this great work, I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The Choir and congregation sang the hymn, "Praise to the Man." 

ELDER ALMA L. PETERSEN 

Former President of the Danish Mission 

My brethren and sisters : I trust that the short time I stand before 
you, you will offer a prayer to our Heavenly Father in my behalf. 

I bring to you a greeting from President Richard R. Lyman and 
his dear wife, who are doing a very fine work in the European Mission. 
I bring to you also a greeting from President Mark Garff of the Danish 
Mission, also the Elders and Saints there. 

I am glad to report to you — and I believe that I can say it truthfully 
— that never before in the history of the Danish Mission have we been 
so respected and so well thought of as we are at the present time. We 
had a wonderful harvest in the past three and a half years, and have 
brought many fine people into the Church. We have brought into the 
Church some very good Catholic people who have become faithful Latter- 
day Saints and are doing a fine work. 

I would be ungrateful were I not to say that we were very for- 
tunate, while I was presiding over the Danish Mission, to have some 
fine brethren and sisters visit us. Brother George D. Pyper visited 
Denmark and visited our Sunday Schools. He did a lot of good for the 
Sunday School cause in the Danish Mission. We had the pleasure of 
having President Grant visit our mission, and I do not know of anything 
that did our mission so much good as the visit of himself and associates. 

I am going to call to your attention just one thing that happened. 
The day that President Grant arrived in Copenhagen one sister, who 
was a faithful Latter-day Saint, came to me and said : "President Peter- 
sen, if I can but shake his hand I know that I will be well." 

I am just citing that to show you the faith that our Saints have in 
the work. They are living the Gospel; I think I dare say that many 
of them are living the Gospel better than we are here at home. I am 
going to refer to one thing that happened just last month. A large 
convention was held in the State of New Jersey, where many of the 
teachers and the professors of different states were present. Helen 
Keller was one of the speakers at this convention, and after she had 
delivered her paper the reporters came to her and asked if they might 



88 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Wednesday, April 6 Third Day 

ask her a personal question. She said she would be very glad to answer 
their questions. This is the question they asked : 

"Miss Keller, if you had the wish of your heart this day, what 
would you ask for?" 

She said: "If I had the wish of my heart, it would be that peace 
might come back to the world again." 

God bless her for such a noble wish ! If I had my wish today, I do 
not think that I would wish for that, because I am not so sure, under 
present conditions, that peace would stay on the earth very long. But 
if I had the wish of my heart today it would be that faith would come 
back to the children of men, that faith would come to the nations of the 
earth, that faith would come back into the homes, that faith more abun- 
dant would come back into our Church, for the Lord has said we cannot 
please him without faith. He has also said that with faith we can 
remove mountains. 

God grant, my brethren and sisters, that faith may increase. "Ask 
and ye shall receive," is the Savior's message. May we ask, and may 
we seek the Lord that faith may come into our hearts, that we may 
serve God and keep his commandments, and I want to bear testimony 
to you that if we will live the Gospel we will relieve the head of this 
Church, the Twelve, and those who preside over us, of many of the 
problems that they have to battle with today. 

God grant unto each and every one of us that we may have more 
faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

President David O. McKay is home on account of illness ; Brother 
Reed Smoot is not feeling well, and we asked him to stay home today. 
Elder John Wells is absent on account of a death in the family. 

We have received the following cablegram from Elder George 
Albert Smith, from Auckland, New Zealand: 

Greetings from Australian and New Zealand Saints. 

ELDER M. CHARLES WOODS 

Former President of the New Zealand Mission 

I have often sat looking from the other end of this house, but I think 
that perhaps other than from the choir seats, I never before looked out 
from the pulpit. Realizing there are many people who attend Conference 
I have often thought, surely it would be an awe-inspiring sight to look 
over the great congregation. 

My family and I returned from New Zealand night before last, 
coming home from the coast by way of Los Angeles and the desert. Just 
prior to our leaving we met Elder George Albert Smith and Elder Rufus 
K. Hardy. Brother Hardy formerly presided there. We saw them for 



ELDER M. CHARLES WOODS 



89 



a day only, as their boat stopped over in New Zealand on its way to 
Australia. 

I contemplate speaking to you sometime so that I may tell you the 
many good things that came into our hearts and our home in that land. 
New Zealand is a land as far south on the other side of the equator as we 
are north. Its largest city, Auckland, is a city larger than Salt Lake. The 
climate is not like Hawaii, neither is it like the other islands of the South 
Seas. The South and North Islands form the great island of New Zea- 
land. It is as large in its extent as the State of Utah. I think it could 
perhaps be called — as it is very often called— The Britain of the South 
Seas. You distinguish it from the other islands of the Pacific by the icy 
fingers which reach skyward on both islands, and by its emerald color so 
different from the desert that I have just crossed. 

And in passing may I say for the first time I was a little ashamed of 
my people as I drove up through the south end of this state, and I hope I 
will not see the same picture when I go farther north. The barns, chicken 
coops, and other buildings are not a credit to this people, that is all I have 
to say along that line ; but perhaps, having a little of the artistic in my 
own nature I should say that some paint would do wonders, and if the 
old gunny sacks hanging on the chicken coops were taken down and some- 
thing else put there in their place, it would be very helpful. 

Paint does wonderful things for both people and places. I know 
that in one case it covers a multitude of skins, while in the other a mul- 
titude of sins. 

I can also say that I noticed some of your meeting houses in the 
south end of the State, the grounds of which had been landscaped but 
are in many cases sadly neglected. I saw only a few from the road. I 
heard the young man who was driving us home in his car remark that 
he admired the people for planting the grounds, but he disliked his people 
for letting them go uncared for. 

I do not know exactly what to say, but to tell you that your boys — 
or I should say young men — are well. I have taken them to my heart 
as my own. You have lost a part of your sons for they are partly mine. 
A man said to me before I left : "Elder Woods, the finest thing that could 
come into a man's life is contact with fine young spirits." We have 
found this to be quite true, and perhaps one of the great compensations 
which is now ours. We expect joy in both this life and in eternity be- 
cause of these contacts. I have often joked with the Elders, telling them 
that all a mission president and his family need to do for a livelihood 
would be to visit their homes and live with them and their relations, con- 
tinuously feasting with them on the fat of the land and enjoying their 
wholesome spirits. 

My two sons have been on missions in Germany, so my entire fami- 
ly has spent time in the mission field. I do not know how many years it 
would be, but we are happy for everyone of them, and the contact with 
your fine sons has added a charm to all our lives. 

I bring to you a fine report from the Saints, as one has just been 
read here. I think perhaps it comes from Elder George Albert Smith. 



90 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Wednesday, April 6 Third Day 

I remember having been the cause of sending conference greetings 
to you a time or two while we were away. 

Really this crowd over-awes me ; I am not thinking properly, I am 
just standing here seeing the sea of faces that are before me. It reminds 
me of looking down upon the many upturned faces as we stood on the 
deck of the vessel before we sailed from the shores of New Zealand. 

We have been treated very kindly by the New Zealand government. 
Our records are constantly used to determine old age pensions, etc. 
There is a kindly feeling between the government officers and our Mis- 
sion office. There has also been a most friendly spirit with the office 
of the American Consul. Mr. Walter I. Boyle, who until recently has 
been American Consul in Auckland for many years, has often invited us 
to his home and many social gatherings. 

The Church owns property in New Zealand and the Elders who are 
among the Maori people have their own homes, the headquarters of the 
different districts. The Elders laboring among the Europeans are not 
so fortunate, but are still paying their board as other missionaries do. 
Your sons among the Maoris are not doing regular preaching, but are 
acting like bishops and helping with the taking care of the sick, building 
and gardening and other things to further the mission work. The Elders 
are all very happy, they love the people of New Zealand and I bring 
their greetings to you Saints here in Zion. 

May God bless you and make you dear to me again as you always 
have been, make you more dear than you have heretofore been, and I ask 
his blessings upon this work and those who are still conducting the great 
ship of Zion, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER PRESTON NIBLEY 

President of the Northwestern States Mission 

I am pleased to report the activities of the Saints and the mission- 
aries in the Northwestern States Mission. 

About forty-five years ago my father and David Eccles of Ogden 
established a sawmill at Baker City, Oregon. They gathered around 
them a few members of the Church as laborers and executives there, 
and gradually a little branch of the Church was formed, a Sunday 
School was established, and, as far as I have been able to learn, that 
was the first Sunday School in what is now the Northwestern States 
Mission. As a child I had the opportunity of attending that Sunday 
School. Returning after an absence of many years, what a great change 
does one behold. 

There is scarcely a city in the Northwest in which we do not find 
a congregation of Latter-day Saints. We now have ninety-six Sunday 
Schools scattered all the way from Alaska to southern Oregon and as 
far east as Great Falls, Montana. We have a membership of fifteen 
thousand people. It is interesting to me to note that our people from 
the stakes are moving into the Northwest. During the year we received 



ELDER PRESTON NIB LEY 



91 



over one thousand recommends in the office of people moving from the 
stakes and settling upon the lands and in the cities of our mission. 

It is also very interesting to me that last year our missionaries found 
over one thousand members of the Church whose presence we were not 
aware of until the missionaries discovered them. Some of our people 
like to move out there and go into hiding, but we like to find them and 
we have organized branches among the people we have found whose 
presence we were not aware of previously. 

There are many great agricultural opportunities in the Northwest. 
They are constructing on the Columbia River at Grand Coulee a dam 
which will divert the waters of the great Columbia River into central 
Washington and irrigate eventually 1,200,000 acres; and I want to 
encourage our people, if the Presidency of the Church agree, to in- 
vestigate the opportunities of that project. 

During the year that has passed we organized in our mission ten 
new branches, twenty-five new Sunday Schools, thirty-four Primaries, 
and nineteen Relief Society organizations, and baptized six hundred 
people. 

I want to say a word about the missionaries. You are sending us 
a fine group of young people, and we enjoy them. The missionaries are 
kept going on their enthusiasm, and I hope that you will write them 
optimistic letters. When the old cow dies, or the mortgage becomes due, 
do not sit right down and write your missionary a twelve-page letter 
about it. Sometimes it takes us two or three weeks to get them back 
and going and steamed up again. 

I want to pay a tribute to President Edward J. Wood, who presides 
over the Alberta Temple. I want to say that that Temple under President 
Wood exerts a fine spiritual influence over our mission, and all our 
Saints who go there return with something that they did not have before. 

My brethren and sisters, this is the kingdom of God that we are 
building on the earth. It contains within it the solution of all the 
problems that perplex mankind. It has only begun to grow ; its limits 
are unknown to us, and of the scope of its work we can hardly conceive. 

In closing I want to read a paragraph from the Prophet Joseph 
Smith's "Wentworth Letter." In 1842, on the 1st of March, the Prophet 
in Nauvoo sat down and wrote a letter to Mr. John Wentworth in 
Chicago, who had inquired concerning the belief of the Latter-day 
Saints. This is one paragraph from that famous letter : 

No unhallowed hand can stop this work from progressing ; persecutions 
may rage, mobs may combine, armies may assemble, calumny may defame, 
but the truth of God will go forth boldly, nobly, and independent, till it 
has penetrated every continent, visited every clime, swept every country, 
and sounded in every ear; till the purposes of God shall be accomplished, 
and the Great Jehovah shall say the work is done. 



My brethren and sisters, I testify to you that the words of the 
Prophet Joseph are true, and I do so in the name of Jesus. Amen. 



92 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Wednesday, April 6 Third Day 

ELDER ORLANDO C. WILLIAMS 



President of the Spanish- American Mission 

My brethren and sisters : I am happy with you in this conference 
session and to receive the inspiration that has come to us. I am thankful 
above all else for the leadership of this Church, for the knowledge we 
have that the Priesthood of God — which is the power to officiate in the 
name of the Lord upon the earth — is directing this Church work and 
all the movements of it. 

I bring to you greetings from the missionaries and Saints in the 
Spanish-American Mission. The missionaries — your sons and daughters 
— are well, and they are happy in the great missionary work that they 
are performing. I was made glad with the words of Brother Ballard, 
wherein he said that the day of the other branches of the House of Israel 
was about to dawn. We feel that the work is opening up among the 
sons and daughters of Father Lehi faster than we can take care of it. 

There seems to be a new spirit among the people, and the missionar- 
ies catch the spirit of it also, and we are laboring diligently, day after day, 
to preach the Gospel to them to their understanding, and to bring to those 
who are already members of the Church a deeper knowledge of its prin- 
ciples and a keener appreciation of the heritage that is theirs. We pray 
continually that the Lord will hasten the day of their redemption, when 
they will be brought into full knowledge and light of the Gospel, and that 
they may feel a closer contact with the body of the Church. 

We of the Spanish-American Mission, like others who are laboring 
among those who speak Spanish, have a love that is deep for those people, 
and we feel that regardless of the color of their skin they are of the 
house of Israel, beloved of our Father in heaven, and are one with us. 

I have been moved many times by the testimonies that I have heard 
as to the truthfulness of the Gospel, but few have moved me more 
deeply than one recently on a conference tour of Texas, when in a little 
town down on the Rio Grande we were holding conference and I called 
on one good brother to speak who had come across the line from his 
home in Old Mexico. As he stood before me bearing his testimony that 
he knew that God lived, that Jesus was the Christ, and that Joseph Smith 
was a prophet of the living God, I was moved deeply by his words and 
the spirit of them. I saw that good brother not as he stood before me, 
bent by age and the privations he had endured throughout his life in a 
struggle for existence, not with a dark skin, but as one of the sons of 
God, measured by the intent of his heart, by his humility, and as he will 
appear in the day when they will be a white and delightsome people. 

I am thankful to my Heavenly Father for the opportunity that is 
mine to labor with that humble, good people, because they are indeed 
choice, and you need not be concerned because your sons and daughters 
are called to labor among them. They are loved by that people, they are 
well received, and they have within their hearts a love that is deep for the 
people who are the sons and daughters of Father Lehi. 

I do not wish to take more of your time, but to leave with you my 



ELDER W. AIRD MacDONALD 



93 



testimony that I know that we are engaged in the Lord's work, and that 
we are being led by inspiration and revelation through the leadership 
that is ours in this Church, and if I would leave any admonition it would 
be that we as a people strive to grow more humble day by day, and that 
we follow more closely the leadership of the Church. I leave this with 
you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER W. AIRD MACDONALD 

President of the California Mission 

I am conscious of what is known as the "dizzy heights." I am 
humbled by the great responsibility that rests upon one who is called to 
address the Saints of the Lord, but I am grateful to bring to you a report 
of the California Mission, and to bring to you the greetings of the mis- 
sionaries and nine thousand fine Saints in that mission. I am happy to 
bring you word that the call of our Prophet at the last Conference, that 
"the presiding officers of the Church shall be keepers of the law," has been 
carried out in the California mission, with the result that there has been 
a revival, if we may call it that, in the faith of the people. 

I am happy to bring to you the greetings of the missionaries, these 
fine young men and young women who have been sent into the field, who, 
with enthusiasm and earnestness, are carrying forward the work of the 
Lord, with the result that during the past year four hundred and twenty- 
five baptisms are recorded in our mission. 

We have fifty-one branches out there, twenty-six of them housed 
in their own chapels. We have organized in the mission six districts, 
operating as "junior stakes," and we place the responsibility of governing, 
developing, and building up these sections and branches on the shoulders 
of local brethren. We are happy to say to you that they have appreciated 
it and are doing a splendid work. 

Ten Priesthood quorums have been organized, which have given 
Priesthood activity to men who for years have read of Priesthood work 
but have had no part in it. A splendid work is being accomplished. 

The highlight of our mission during the past six months has been 
the recent visit of Elder Joseph Fielding Smith of the Council of the 
Twelve. He visited all parts of the mission and preached the Gospel 
of Jesus Christ to the people. Our people appreciated it and were thrilled 
at hearing the good old-fashioned Gospel preached and they were greatly 
instructed by Elder Smith. They will long remember his visit to the 
mission. 

I am grateful for the opportunity that has come to us to labor in 
this great missionary work, for, as the Prophet has said, "after all has 
been said, our greatest work is to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ." So 
I am thrilled for the opportunity of laboring with these fine missionaries, 
young men and women who have been sent there to preach the Gospel. 
I am reminded of what a state official said to me recently in Sacramento : 



94 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Wednesday, April 6 Third Day 

"I do not know much about your Mormon theology or what you teach, but 
I think you are doing one of the greatest works among the youth of 
America today." 

I asked him to explain, and he said : "It is in these young men you 
send on missions who go about the world. If I had a son I would want 
him to go on a mission for the Mormon Church." 

I thought that was a real tribute. He had seen and witnessed the 
growth and improvement that comes to these young men and young 
women who labor in the mission field. 

So, to you parents, I want to say that nothing in the world that you 
can do for your sons and daughters will ever measure up to the ex- 
periences, or the growth and development that will come to them, nor 
the possibilities for future success, as for the time they spend in the 
mission field. So I hope that you will regard a mission for your sons 
and daughters as one of the obligations that the Lord has placed upon 
you ; to see that they have opportunity to engage in this service that will 
carry them far in their lives. 

I am grateful to report to you the fine work of the Saints in the 
California Mission, and to bring you the message, you Bishops of wards, 
that a little branch in California whose obedience to the law of tithing 
during the past year gave them a $30 per capita record; and another 
little branch in Arizona where every member who earned during the 
year paid tithing ; a branch that is 100 % in keeping of that law. 

We have more than ten branches in the California Mission that paid 
tithing per capita above $14. I have labored in the stakes, and I know 
what it is to try to get some of our people to obey this law. We sing, 
"We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet," and "Come, Listen to a 
Prophet's Voice," and when we hear these voices we pay little heed to 
them. It seems to be the spirit of people to revere the old prophets and 
to slay the living ones. I want to bear testimony to you that we are 
guided by prophets of God today, and that the work of this Church and 
its leadership is in the hands of men inspired of our Father in heaven, 
and the Latter-day Saint who listens and obeys counsel will always find 
his footsteps in the paths of righteousness. 

I bear testimony to you that this is the work of the Lord, the Gospel 
of Jesus Christ. I bear testimony to you that Joseph Smith was a prophet 
of God, and that the Book of Mormon is the word of the Lord, that 
we as a people should be more concerned and more familiar with the 
truths that are contained in these sacred records. God bless us to be a 
people that shall be an example to the world, that our good works may 
lead other good men and women throughout the world to a knowledge of 
the truth. I want to say to you, in harmony with what I said about our 
being led by prophets of God, that this recent new work that has been 
inaugurated in the Church — our great welfare program — -is the key that 
opens more doors in the mission field today than anything else. Men 
everywhere are interested in knowing what the Mormon Church is doing 
for its people, and not alone that they are being cared for, but that the 
Church is requiring every man to be a worker and not an idler. Intelli- 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT

gent men of the world are concerned with the fact that this Church re- 
quires labor from those who shall receive its gratuities. 

God bless us to be what we ought to be, I pray, in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 

An anthem, "Send Forth Thy Spirit" (Schuetky), was sung by the 



Elder Leonard G. Ball, President of the Idaho Falls Stake, offered 
the closing prayer. 

Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock. 



The concluding session of the Conference convened Wednesday after- 
noon, April 6, at 2 o'clock. 

President Heber J. Grant announced that the Tabernacle Choir 
would furnish the music for this meeting, and that the Choir and congre- 
gation would sing as the opening number, "How Firm a Foundation." 

After the singing of this hymn, the invocation was offered by Elder 
Taylor Nelson, President of the Oneida Stake. 



Presented for the vote of the Conference the General Authorities 
and General Officers of the Church, also the General Auxiliary Officers, 
and they were unanimously sustained, as follows : 



Heber J. Grant, Prophet, Seer, and Revelator and President of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 

J. Reuben Clark, Jr., First Counselor in the First Presidency. 
David O. McKay, Second Counselor in the First Presidency.

It is only fair to say to the good people here that during the admini- 
stration of Bishop Sylvester Q. Cannon and his counselors the affairs of 
the Church have been managed in a most wonderful and splendid manner, 
that we have had more buildings erected than in any other similar period 
since the erection of these buildings has been placed under the direction 
of the Presiding Bishopric, that the work has been done much better and 
at much less expense in proportion to the kind of buildings than at any 
previous time. 

The Presidency have appreciated the great burden of work that was 
lifted from their shoulders and placed upon the shoulders of the Presiding 
Bishopric a few years ago, and the Bishopric have done that work in a 
splendid manner. We appreciate it beyond our power to express it.

of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

On the sacred pages of the Book of Mormon these eternal truths ap- 
pear : 

Angels speak by the power of the Holy Ghost; wherefore they 
speak the words of Christ. (2 Nephi 32:3.) 

And again: 

For when a man speaketh by the power of the Holy Ghost the power 
of the Holy Ghost carrieth it unto the hearts of the children of men. 
(2 Nephi 33:1.) 

A man is fearfully and wonderfully made. In this earthen vessel 
are heavenly treasures — an immortal spirit of which God is the Father, 
the immortal Priesthood and the immortal gift of the Holy Ghost. Surely 
we ought not to defile the temple of the Holy Ghost by using things which 
our Father hath forbidden. 

Quite recently one of the foremost captains of British industry vis- 
ited Canada, and in the course of a public address gave this forceful 
admonition: "Do not think," he said, "that education weans you from 
the spiritual law." He was, of course, referring to education in a broad 
sense, to the schooling we receive in the University of Life. But when 
the spiritual law is subordinated to the selfish plans and feelings of men, 
misery steps in. If the spiritual law were dominant in the hearts of men 
there would be no wars. With few exceptions every war has been "a 
rich man's war and a poor man's fight." It is said that three-fourths of 
the men who fought in the Confederate Army never owned a slave. 

President Brigham Young called Karl G. Maeser, the great educa- 
tor, to go to Provo to organize and conduct an academy to be established 
in the name of the Church — a Church school. Before leaving for Provo 
to start his work he went to President Young and said : "Have you any 
instructions to give me ?" 

The President looked steadily forward for a few moments, as though 
in deep thought, then said: "Brother Maeser, I want you to remember 
that you ought not to teach even the alphabet or the multiplication tables 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 



99 



without the Spirit of God. That is all. God bless you. Goodbye." That 
was Dr. Maeser's guiding star. By that spirit he reached the hearts and 
touched the lives of thousands for good and brought them into that true 
idealism — the right of the spiritual law to be uppermost in the hearts of 
men. 

The work of the Holy Ghost is wonderful. The Prophet Joseph 
Smith said : "You might as well baptize a bag of sand as a man if not 
done in view of the remission of sins and getting of the Holy Ghost. Bap- 
tism by water is but half a baptism, and is good for nothing without the 
other half — that is, the baptism of the Holy Ghost." The regenerating 
and cleansing power of the Spirit is a blessing from heaven. 

Jesus Christ tells us that "whatsoever ye would that men should do to 
you, do ye even so to them." We are told to rise above all carnal desires, 
to walk uprightly, conquering self, which will give us the testimony that 
we are pleasing God. But how can men do these things without that 
greater power of righteousness in their souls that the Holy Ghost brings 
to them ; that great regenerating force which enables them to cast from 
them lust, evil thoughts, and the thought of doing things that will hurt 
their fellow creatures? This great strength, the powerful operation of 
the Holy Ghost will make one shake at the very appearance of evil. 

There is another office of the Holy Ghost: He will guide into all 
truth. The Lord Jesus said : 

Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you 
into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall 
hear, that shall he speak ; and he will show you things to come. 

He shall glorify me ; for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it 
unto you. 

And again he said : 

But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will 
send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your 
remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you. 

I hope that every man in this vast congregation will bear in mind 
this holy truth so that when he returns to his home this great Remem- 
brancer will bring to his heart and to his mind, in the moment of his 
need, the instructions he has received from this pulpit by the servants of 
the Lord. 

"He will guide you into all truth." What is truth ? "And truth is 
knowledge of things as they are, and as they were, and as they are to 
come." What a broad, comprehensive definition of truth the Lord gives ! 
And because we are guided into all truth by that infallible guide, the Com- 
forter, we hold dear to our hearts these great fundamental principles: 
The divine parentage and the mission of the Lord Jesus Christ, his 
crucifixion and divine atonement, the glorious resurrection, eternal 
life, the eternity of the marriage covenant, — all of which bring forth 
joys inexpressible, the unspeakable gifts of God, manifested to our souls 
by the Holy Spirit. 



100 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Wednesday, April 6 Third Day 

The Lord said to the Prophet Joseph Smith : 

Yea, behold, I will tell you in your mind and in your heart, by the 
Holy Ghost, which shall come upon you and which shall dwell in your 
heart. 

Now, behold, this is the spirit of revelation; behold, this is the spirit 
by which Moses brought the children of Israel through the Red Sea on dry 
ground. 

The Holy Ghost is an infallible witness that God is no respecter of 
persons. Stake presidents, bishops and all officers in the Church may 
have for their guidance and direction in the duties with which they are 
entrusted this blessed spirit of inspiration, so that they will hear behind 
them a voice, "This is the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right 
hand or when ye turn to the left." 

The Holy Ghost is the genius of the Holy Priesthood. Remove 
from this body of men, clothed with this power, dispossess them, if that 
were possible of the guiding influence of the spirit of revelation and they 
would be as unproductive in the ministry as the dry sand on the seashore. 

The spirit of revelation directs the leaders of the Church in the ap- 
pointment of officers. They pray to the Lord. "Thou, Lord, which 
knowest the hearts of all men, shew whether of these two thou hast chos- 
en." The Lord is the searcher of the heart. He knows the qualifications, 
the most secret purposes and intentions and dispositions of all men. Every 
man whom we have sustained by our vote this afternoon, in the posi- 
tion to which he has been appointed, that man, I testify, has been chosen 
by the spirit of revelation, by the Holy Ghost, which, as I have stated is 
the genius of the Priesthood. While this spirit remains in the Church— 
and it will remain forever — we need not be afraid that we will be led 
astray, for God loves us. He loves the men whom he has appointed and 
he will move upon them, by the Holy Spirit, to select men whom he has 
chosen to be overseers of the flock, "to feed the Church of God." 

The Holy Ghost is the testimony of Jesus. "No man," said the 
Apostle Paul, "can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost." 
The Savior declared that "the kingdom of God cometh not with observa- 
tion," not by external show, for the world is deceived by outward orna- 
ment. "Man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh 
on the heart." 

When the Savior of the world stood before that cruel judge, Pontius 
Pilate, and Pilate, in a sneering manner, addressed this question to the 
Savior, "What is truth?" the embodiment of truth was before him. 
Truth personified was there. But Pontius Pilate could not recognize the 
truth. Why? Because "the kingdom of God cometh not with observa- 
tion." 

"Except a man be born again," said Jesus Christ, "he cannot see the 
kingdom of God," and, "Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, 
he cannot enter into the kingdom of God." It has been said by a philos- 
opher, that the eye sees what the mind brings it the power to see. The 
talented artist, the organist who presides at the console of this world 
famous Tabernacle organ, reads the music and translates it into wonder- 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS

f ul harmonies. I can see the notes as well as he can but I cannot interpret 
them because the power is not in my mind. I am not a musician. This 
organist has acquired this technical training. He sees what the mind 
gives him the power to see and interprets the written notes into this beau- 
tiful melody and heavenly music which we have enjoyed at this confer- 
ence. 

The Latter-day Saints have the Holy Ghost in their hearts. John 
Wesley rose to a great height of inspiration when he said : "We through 
the Holy Ghost can witness better things." Because we have the gift of 
the Spirit we can behold all the wonderful truths of the Gospel. We 
know the kingdom of God is on the earth. Any man that has the Com- 
forter will never deny that the Constitution of the United States is in- 
spired, but he will revere it for the Lord directed the men who wrote 
that glorious instrument. 

Jesus asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of 
man am? 

And they said, Some say thou art John the Baptist ; some, Elias ; and 
others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets. 

He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? 

And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of 
the living God. 

And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon-Bar- 
jona; for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father 
whiich is in heaven. 

And I say unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will 
build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. (Mat- 
thew 16:13-18.) 

Brethren and sisters, may I in humility and in the spirit of testi- 
mony, declare in the fear of God, and in the presence of angels, for I be- 
lieve there are beings here from the other world listening to what we are 
saying, that I believe with all my heart and know that this Church is 
built upon the rock of revelation, and I testify to you, in the name of the 
Lord Jesus Christ, that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God, that he was 
a great revelator in the hands of the Lord to deliver unto mankind the 
glorious truths of the Gospel. 

JOSEPH SMITH'S TESTIMONY 

Joesph Smith, an apostle of Jesus Christ, through whose instrumen- 
tality the Lord established his Church upon the earth for the last time, 
thus testifies of the resurrected Christ : 

And now, after the many testimonies which have been given of him, 
this is the testimony, last of all, which we give of him ; That He lives ! 

For we saw him, even on the right hand of God; and we heard the 
voice bearing record that he is the Only Begotten of the Father. 

Joseph sealed the truth of his noble testimony by his death. 

I testify, that President Heber J. Grant is moved by the Holy Ghost, 
by the spirit of revelation, to lead and to guide this people. The intro- 
duction of this Church Welfare movement has already increased faith. 



102 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Wednesday, April 6 Third Day 

It has decreased selfishness. It has increased the portion of the Holy 
Spirit which God has given to his people. 

May we sustain our President, his counselors, and all the leaders of 
the Church. May we sustain the rank and file of our brethren and sisters, 
and praise God that this blessed gift of the Holy Ghost, the spirit of 
revelation, shines gloriously in this Church, is my prayer, in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 

First Counselor in the First Presidency 

I trust I may be permitted to refer to my observations at the last 
April Conference (1937), and to reaffirm what I then said, in the lan- 
guage in which I then said it. I made then and make now no prediction. 
I merely gave by way of admonition the benefit of what many responsible 
men of affairs were then saying. In so far as I am advised, these men 
have not changed their minds. In my own view, for what it may be 
worth, conditions appear to me to be in no better way. 

PROFITABLE INVESTMENTS ENCOURAGED 

After that Conference people wrote asking if they should sell this 
or that property which they held. They were told I had offered no 
trading or marketing advice, no advice about selling or buying, but 
warned against speculation, that is, gambling. Others wrote asking 
if they should run in debt for this or that purpose. 

To the latter it was replied that the Church had always counselled 
against running in debt, that this seemed still sound counsel, and that if 
it were ever wisely to be disregarded, it would be in connection with the 
buying of a home, or a farm, or stocking a ranch, or for carrying on 
some line of business. The suggestion was added that even in such cases 
the whole proposal should be carefully gone into so as to make as sure as 
might be that the inves'tment to be made would be profitable. 

BORROWING BRINGS BURDENS 

I should like now to talk about that question of debt a little more. 
I shall say nothing new. Everybody knows the things I shall mention. 
My only excuse for naming them is that sometimes some of us forget 
what should, in wisdom, be remembered. What I shall say will not so 
much concern business men who are supposed to know when and how 
to borrow. I am speaking to the great bulk of us who have little or no 
business training and experience, and perhaps not too much business 
ability. I belong with this bulk and have had a chastening experience 
in debt. 

It is a rule of our financial and economic life in all the world that 
interest is to be paid on borrowed money. May I say something about 
interest ? 



PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 103 

Interest never sleeps nor sickens nor dies ; it never goes to the hos- 
pital; it works on Sundays and holidays; it never takes a vacation; it 
never visits nor travels ; it takes no pleasure ; it is never laid off work 
nor discharged from employment ; it never works on reduced hours ; it 
never has short crops nor droughts ; it never pays taxes ; it buys no food ; 
it wears no clothes; it is unhoused and without home and so has no 
repairs, no replacements, no shingling, plumbing, painting, or white- 
washing; it has neither wife, children, father, mother, nor kinfolk to 
watch over and care for; it has no expense of living; it has neither 
weddings nor births nor deaths ; it has no love, no sympathy ; it is as hard 
and soulless as a granite cliff. Once in debt, interest is your companion 
every minute of the day and night; you cannot shun it or slip away 
from it ; you cannot dismiss it ; it yields neither to entreaties, demands, 
or orders ; and whenever you get in its way or cross its course or fail 
to meet its demands, it crushes you. 

So much for the interest we pay. Whoever borrows should under- 
stand what interest is ; it is with them every minute of the day and night. 

STATISTICS ON FARM MORTGAGES 

As to running in debt to buy a farm, particularly for the greater 
part of the purchase price, or for any considerable loan on a farm, I 
should like to give you the following facts. 

During the recent depression a great insurance company had to 
foreclose on farm property which had been mortgaged to it for some 
$65,000,000. The presumed actual value of these foreclosed lands was 
more than $100,000,000, which is approximately the value of all the 
farm lands of the state of Utah. The lands foreclosed were among the 
richest farming lands in this country. 

After the company acquired the lands, it wrote them down about 
10 per cent of the estimated actual value, so that they now stand on the 
books at about $55,000,000. 

The net profit for last year on all these lands taken together was 
3.03 per cent on the written down value of $55,000,000. This would 
be equal to about 1.6 per cent on the full value as of the date of mortgage. 

The very large amount involved and the location of the farms would 
seem to indicate that this is a fair example of the returns on the better 
farm lands of the country. 

May I suggest to you farmers and would-be farmers that you can 
hardly hope to borrow money, relatively large sums of money, at 5 
per cent or 3 per cent or even 2 per cent and then pay out, principal 
and interest, in an enterprise that will net you only 1.6 per cent. That 
is the simplest mathematics. 

EASY MONEY NOT A BLESSING 

Let me say in passing that it seems to me the worst curse the farmer 
has ever had — worse than pests, or drouths, or frosts, or even poor 



104 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Wednesday, April 6 • Third Da} 

markets — is the easy money which has been thrown in his path. What 
the farmer needs is not easy money but good, profitable markets. 

These same principles hold good in all enterprises of all kinds. 

I should like also to say something about long time debts, say 20 
or 30 years, for remodeling and improving homes. I am not unfamiliar 
with the stock arguments and reasoning used to support this kind of 
borrowing. But we must fully consider this: Any improvement such 
as bathrooms, modern heating and refrigerating plants, and the like, 
will, in the course of ten years, probably be old, out of style, and largely 
obsolete. If the family is the ordinary one, they will at the end of ten 
years clamor for new, up-to-date furnishings, for another and modern 
remodeling. When that times comes the family will have to realize that 
it must go on paying principal and interest for another ten or twenty 
years on the worn bath tub and basin, the stained and cracked kitchen 
sink, the smoky furnace, and all the rest. This assumes, of course, that 
we have been able to keep up our payments for the first ten years and 
have not lost the whole property before that time, both what we put into 
the house as well as the house itself. 

INSTALLMENT BUYING DISCOURAGED 

I say this notwithstanding that in my view no home is too good, 
no comfort too great, no luxury too rich for the very humblest family 
that can afford them ; but for the least essential comforts and for all 
the luxuries, let me urge you to pay as you go. 

I wish to add something on installment buying — that popular method 
of running in debt for things and paying for them while you wear them 
out. Installment buying is a twin brother of longtime loans for remodel- 
ing and furnishings. A part of a successful installment plan is a very 
high, usually hidden rate of interest. 

I know that in speaking of this I am treading on debatable ground. 
However, I feel something might wisely be said about it by way of 
caution, 

In 1929 it has been estimated that installment purchases amounted 
to 6.5 billions of dollars. Dr. Wilford L. White, chief of the marketing 
division of the Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce, is quoted 
as saying that "installment contracts entered into during, or immediately 
prior to 1929 contributed to the last depression." 

Statisticians say that in 1935 there were 3.6 billions of dollars of 
installment purchases ; for 1936 the estimates run from 4.5 billions of 
dollars to 13.5 billions of dollars; for 1937 installment purchases have 
been estimated at better than 5 billions of dollars. 

The system has been defended as justifying itself "by providing 
the luxuries of yesterday for families of limited incomes today by 
allowing those families to purchase such goods by pledging part of their 
future earnings." 

Its value has been appraised in this language: "It encourages pro- 
duction of luxury goods, thus reducing the consumption of necessaries. 
It promotes extravagance, based on the chances of continuing and rising 



PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 105 

incomes, and thus increases stringency at a time when trade is shrinking. 
It creates a body of debt that stands in part for something already 
consumed. It leads to over-production of luxury goods, and, like mone- 
tary inflation, leads to a condition which requires for its maintenance 
larger doses of the same stimulant, shown by its extension to articles 
which depreciate rapidly." 

A British economist affirms: "It has done much harm in America; 
it has been drastically limited in many parts of Europe ; it is the enemy 
of real thrift ; it is most tempting to the least provident." 

To buy on the installment plan means to mortgage your future 
earnings. If through sickness or death, or through loss of work, the 
earnings cease, the property bought is lost together with what has been 
put into it. 

I venture one suggestion, — until times become more certain, the 
ordinary family will do well to purchase by installment only the actual 
necessaries of life, leaving the luxuries to be bought as they can be paid 
for when purchased. 

I shall not attempt to draw a line between necessities and luxuries, 
beyond saying that an artisan or mechanic who can ride to work on the 
train or street car would hardly be justified in buying an airplane for 
that purpose on the installment plan ; or would a farmer already owning 
a cow pony to go to the pasture for the cows be justified in buying an 
automobile on the installment plan to be used for the same purpose. 

I can only mention here, again by way of caution, another con- 
tributing element of danger in our economic life, that is, those seasonal, 
crop, or other short term financings which unwisely base operation for 
future profits on borrowed money. 

TAX-PAYERS MUST MEET PUBLIC DEBTS 

If I might be pardoned, I should like to add another word about two 
closely related subjects which I have mentioned or referred to at almost 
every, if not every, Conference since April, 1933 ; I refer to the enormous 
expenditures of the people's money and to the ever-growing feeling and 
belief that a great group of the people can live off the public without 
working. 

I should like to say again that neither the State nor the Federal 
Government has any funds except only such funds as it obtains from the 
people. Neither of them has anywhere a great pile of gold to which it 
can go for its money. You taxpayers must furnish it all; and every 
citizen is a taxpayer, either by direct or indirect taxation. Whenever 
governments borrow, they borrow from the taxpayers who must pay 
back or repudiate. To pay back large borrowings causes great hardship 
and burdening sacrifices ; to repudiate brings economic and sometimes 
political chaos. 

CHURCH EXPENDITURES CAREFULLY HANDLED 

Some of our own members seem to be thinking that the Church too 
has a pile of gold. It has not. All the Church has is the moderate 



106 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Wednesday, April 6 Tliird Day 

income it receives from investments it has made out of the savings 
from your past contributions, and the tithing and donations which you 
faithful members — usually not the critics and fault-finders — make for 
the support of the work. You have had a report as to how that money 
has been spent during the past year. I assure you there are no secret or 
hidden expenditures. All are recorded and all audited. The Church 
does not have one cent to be spent by any one for any purpose except 
upon an accounting made after the expenditure is made under an au- 
thority given for the expenditure. May I say here, the Church is not 
in debt ; none of its property is mortgaged ; none of its security pledged. 

Now, as to the other point, — the living of one large group without 
work on the industry, thrift, and sacrifice of the rest of the people. 
I say again this is virtual slavery for those who furnish the livelihood 
for the idlers. I know very well I shall be accused of being harsh, 
cruel, unsympathetic. I am not. But I consider the welfare of the 
whole people as superior to the comfortable or luxurious idleness of 
the part. 

To this kind of expenditure belong these old age gratuities or 
doles, which, to salve somebody's conscience, are called pensions. I 
mention this matter because it is growing to such large proportions and 
because it will have such a far-reaching and destructive effect upon the 
character of the people, young as well as old. 

I may begin by saying these are not properly pensions, a term which 
has always implied one or both of two things: Either a conspicuous 
service performed for all the people which merits from the people a 
special recognition upon infirmity from age or otherwise, or a plan by 
which the pensioner himself has contributed to the building of the pension 
fund he receives. These old age pensions so-called have neither of these 
elements. 

Where these gratuities are honestly due under the law there is no 
legal objection to taking them. But I warn you who take them not to 
count too much upon them for they cannot continue to be paid in- 
definitely. Furthermore, where these gratuities are obtained by falsifying 
the true condition, by hiding property, by deeding it away in order to 
qualify for the dole, or by using any device to hide or distort the real 
situation, this is downright dishonesty. 

I honor and respect old age. I would not see it suffer from want, 
nor from disease that can be helped. It is entitled to every care, to 
every act of kindness, to every loving caress which a grateful community 
and a devoted family can give. 

I have every sympathy with age. I know the difficulties which age 
has in fitting into modern, economic life. I have had many matured, 
outstanding men come to me in New York seeking work. Some had 
been discharged from jobs they had worked up to during a long life 
of service. The depression had replaced them with young men who had 
more endurance and who would work for less money. In America at 
least the human wastage in the depression was far greater than the 



PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 



107 



human wastage of the World War. The old man out of work is one of 
the most pathetic, heart-tearing tragedies of today. 

Some plan must be devised that shall make certain that no aged 
person shall be cold or go hungry or unclad. But the prime responsi- 
bility for supporting an aged parent rests upon his family, not upon 
society. Ours is not a socialistic or communistic state, where the people 
are mere vassals to be driven about as animals from one corral to another. 
We are freemen. So still with us the family has its place and its 
responsibilities and duties, which are God-given. The family which 
refuses to keep its own is not meeting its duties. When an aged parent 
has no family or when the family is itself without means, then society 
must, as a matter of merest humanity, come to the rescue. This is 
perfectly clear. 

But it is a far cry from this wise principle to saying that every 
person reaching a fixed age shall thereafter be kept by the state in idleness. 
Society owes to no man a life of idleness, no matter what his age. I have 
never seen one line in Holy Writ that calls for, or even sanctions this. 
In the past no free society has been able to support great groups in 
idleness and live free. 

CHURCH WELFARE WORK 

I wish in closing to say a few words about our Church Welfare 
Work. You have heard a detailed report about its work. It has been 
operating for two years only. Behind it is merely the purely voluntary 
contribution by Church members, some 767,000 men, women, and chil- 
dren, and some others who have out of a love for humanity made also 
gratuitous contributions. 

Of this number of Church members more than 172,000 made cash 
voluntary gifts in addition to their tithing and other contributions during 
1937. This means that as much as 60 per cent of the adult membership 
of the Church, both male and female, made cash contributions to this 
Plan for relieving human want. This in itself is a great spiritual, 
Christian achievement. During this year out of these Fast Offerings 
and other Church revenues, assistance has been given to some 44,000 
persons. 

We have not fully met our problem, but this is only our second 
year. We feel we have made a good start. We have gained experience. 
We are conducting a Church-wide budget operation based upon the 
reports of Bishops as to their estimated needs for this year so that not- 
withstanding the economic difficulties that overhang the nation, we may 
more nearly solve our full problem. 

The Church has never said it was going to give employment to all 
unemployed Church members. It has said it would do what it could 
to this end. It has done so. It has found employment for some 6,000 
of its members, which may represent as many as 30,000 members of 
families. 

The Church has never said it would try to take its members off 
governmental work projects. But the Church has repeatedly urged every

Wednesday, April 6 Third Day 

Church member employed by the government to give an honest, full 
day's work for a day's pay. 

There are certain elements in the general relief situation in this 
interwest region where the bulk of our members live which are not 
always in mind. In the first place, at least half of the population in this 
area are not members of the Church. A very large percentage of these 
non-members are engaged in industrial occupations which are particularly 
affected by the present economic decline. In the next place, for one 
reason or another not now necessary to consider, it seems fairly clear 
that no small number of those classed as Church members on govern- 
mental rolls are either not on the Church rolls at all or have been wholly 
inactive for years, many of them since childhood. Too frequently these 
persons show a fixed unwillingness to give up governmental aid for 
Church relief. The basic element of the Church program is work in 
exchange for relief. 

The first effort of the Church has been consciously directed towards 
relieving the needs of the worthy members of the Church whose prior 
activity calls for consideration from the whole Church membership. 
But the Church has not turned its back upon the others ; it welcomes their 
return to activity ; it will look out for them just as rapidly as they can be 
reached. 

So, all in all, I wish to tender my heartfelt gratitude, my sincere 
congratulations, to the Relief Society — every officer and woman of them 
— to the Presiding Bishopric, to the Priesthood quorums, to the General 
Committee, to the Bishops of wards and Presidents of stakes, to regular 
and auxiliary organizations of the Church, stakes and wards, to our 
Church periodicals, to every man and woman who has in any way 
helped in this great undertaking, and particularly to those hundreds who, 
somewhat careless of their duties in the past, have come forward in 
these critical times and taken on this new work fighting as veterans against 
our common enemy — want. We welcome you brothers and sisters. I 
know that to every man, woman and child, who has given from his 
abundance or who has offered the widow's mite to help his less for- 
tunate, suffering brothers, there has come a peace and joy that has 
carried into his heart more of unselfish love for his fellowman than 
any unlike thing he has ever done. They have realized the truth of the 
great principle announced by James : 

Pure religion and undented before God and the Father is this : to 
visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself 
unspotted from the world. 

After and above all, as was stated in the financial report, while 
the Church Welfare aims, of course, to help those in need, its real purpose 
is not merely to substitute Church gratuities for others furnished by 
charitable or governmental agencies but to rebuild the characters of its 
members and to promote and to foster the patriotic, civic, and spiritual 
qualities of the people.

atoning sacrifice, Jesus declared the fate of those who should stand 
on the left hand at the day of judgment. 

Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, 
ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels. 

For I was an hungered, and ye gave me no meat ; I was thirsty, and 
ye gave me no drink. 

I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me 
not; sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not. 

Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee 
an hungered, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and 
did not minister unto Thee? 

Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily, I say unto you, Inasmuch 
as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me. 

And these shall go away into everlasting punishment ; but the right- 
eous into life eternal. 

The resurrected Christ, breakfasting the seven disciples on the 
shores of the Sea of Tiberias in the early morning, saith unto Peter 
thrice : "Peter, lovest thou me ?" Peter thrice replied, "Yea, Lord, thou 
knowest I love thee;" and Christ thrice commanded, "Feed my sheep." 

The Choir and congregation sang the hymn, "The Spirit of God Like 
a Fire is Burning." 

ELDER WILLIAM T. TEW, JR. 

President of the East Central States Mission 

Not only do mission presidents preside in the mission field without 
counselors, but usually they are kept on the anxious seat throughout the 
conference here. I am thankful for this opportunity of being here this 
afternoon. I am thankful to President Grant for calling me at this hour. 

Today is the hundred and eighth anniversary of the organization of 
this Church. All day I have been looking back, in my mind, to that 
little group of six men in Fayette, Seneca County, New York, in the 
living room of Peter Whitmer, where this Church was organized a 
hundred and eight years ago. In a way I have tried to visualize the 
progress, the expansion, the development, the power and the influence 
this Church has wielded and how it has grown during this century of 
progress. 

On the 30th of September, 1937, I noticed the following quotation in 
the Deseret News. There had assembled, in this city, leaders of the 
Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America. They adjourned 
on the 30th of September, with this conclusion : 

That realism must replace sentimentalism, and conviction must take 
the place of emotionalism, if Christianity is to be employed in the solution 
of the world's ills. 

We have known that for a century or more. If there is any one 
thing in the world that this Church does stand for, it is realism and not 
sentimentalism ; conviction and not emotionalism. 



110 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Wednesday, April 6 Third Day 

Brethren and sisters and friends, I rejoice in the fact that I am 
called to preside over one of the missions of this Church. I rejoice in 
the young men and young women who are sent unto us in the mission 
fields. They are outstanding in their characters, in their determination 
to serve the Lord. Their testimonies are firm and steadfast. They have 
visions of what they want to do and where they want to go. They 
carry with them a wonderful influence. I bring you, fathers and mothers, 
their greetings, their love, their affection, and their regard for you. They 
are loyal to this Church. 

I feel to confess today that as far as I am concerned I am in perfect 
accord with the leadership of this Church, with the principles they pro- 
claim. I know, as you know, that the Savior gave us the key of testimony 
when he said, that if a man will do the will of the Father he shall know 
of the doctrine. The converse of that is also true, my brothers and 
sisters : When we cease to do the will of the Father, we lose our testi- 
monies of the Gospel and we forget the doctrine. When we begin to 
compromise, and sift out, and reject certain phases of the Gospel, we 
are on dangerous ground. 

I am thankful to my Heavenly Father for membership in this 
Church, which has stood the test of a century and more of progress, down 
to this particular period of time. I want to bring you this message, and 
leave it with you today, that not only we but other churches recognize 
our position in the world. 

In Fort Wayne, Indiana, on the 11th day of November, 1937, there 
was announced, by the Council of the Methodist Church a spiritual 
crusade which was to be launched among their members, looking toward 
a revival of devotional convictions. The thing that attracted my attention 
was this : The crusade will begin with a united council, on the further- 
ance of faith and service, to be held in Chicago. The focus of attention 
and effort will be upon the' rank and file of the younger generation. 
Bishop Edgar Blake, of the Detroit area, announced : "You can't build 
the new order with the old men, men whose hearts are still worshiping 
the idols that are falling all around us." 

What a pity it is, my brethren and sisters, that after a century of 
time these men are just now realizing that the idols that they have wor- 
shiped for so many centuries are beginning to fall, and that the young 
men are the ones on whom they should focus their attention. As a matter 
of fact these idols began to fall more than a century ago when the Lord 
laid the axe at the root of the trees of false teachings in the Sacred Grove. 

Thank God for our Mutual Improvement organization, for our 
Church school system. Remember, my brethren and sisters, that con- 
servation of the youth of Zion is desired far above reclamation. 

May we live our religion. May we teach our boys and girls. May 
the work of the Lord progress and increase until it fills the earth. Let us 
support and sustain our leaders, our prophets, seers and revelators, not 
only with our hands but with our actions, I pray in Jesus' name. Amen.

ELDER DAVID A. BROADBENT 

President of the North Centred States Mission 

Brethren and sisters, I realize that these are valuable moments. I 
come to you with the greetings of ninety glorious youths laboring in our 
mission. I have met them all within the month, and they are well, happy, 
and enjoying their labors. 

I desire, for the few moments given to me, to speak of a phase of 
missionary life which has not been touched upon by my fellow associates 
of the mission presidents. 

Recently there was a great gathering of the Ministerial Association 
of the State of Minnesota, in the city of St. Paul. They spent a long 
half day upon the question of Mormonism. Among other things that 
they presented were their objections to such glorious messages as we 
have just listened to from our beloved President Clark, as being non- 
religious, but as being "spiritualized ethics." They took exception to the 
wonderful message in the book prepared by Dr. F. S. Harris and his 
associate editor, "The Fruits of Mormonism," because it was prepared 
by Mormons. 

They took grave exceptions to the most recent article on the Mor- 
mon question which has found its way into the Encyclopedia Britannica, 
because Senator Reed Smoot wrote it, and it was not publicized that he 
was also a member of the Council of the Twelve Apostles. It appeared 
that everything they did and said was like the proverbial "drowning man 
grasping for a straw." They also made very much of the fact that we 
are over-advertised in our Church Security Program. 

I sat in this building two years ago, and I recall very distinctly that 
President Grant suggested to the gallery of reporters who were here: 
"We want no word published from this meeting. When we are ready 
to give our message to the public we will give them through the press 
our position on this matter, and we will add to it as we desire from 
time to time." 

As this gathering of the ministerial association closed its report, this 
was the concluding paragraph: (I am reading from their own published 
statement) 

In the interest of Christianity and Mormonism, our plea is, though 
not formally stated, for Protestant people to inform themselves on the sub- 
ject of Mormonism, and likewise to inform themselves on the principles 
of their own faith, for only then can an intelligent understanding of Mor- 
mon problems be effected. 

We are grateful for that admonition on. the part of that great 
gathering of ministers. 

I have the privilege of living in the same city, as the headquarters 
of our mission, where one of the greatest national authorities on temper- 
ance resides, Dr. W. G. Calderwood. A member of the Minnesota Tem- 
perance Organization came to me wanting to know more about the Word 
of Wisdom, but he said : "I represent one of the great insurance com-

panies. We have come to the conclusion, since we have been studying for 
the past three years, that from eighty to ninety per cent of all of the 
automobile accidents are caused as a result of the use of liquor. We 
have about come to the conclusion that we can offer two types of insur- 
ance and give those who are total abstainers a twenty-five per cent better 
policy than those who are users of liquor." 

One of the finest ladies from the city of Minneapolis, which is a city 
of five hundred thousand population, came to me immediately after that 
meeting, and she said : "I have been assigned, by my Ladies' Christian 
organization, to bring to them the message of Mormonism." After we 
studied for two hours or more she said: "This is such a magnificent 
message that I am sure I shall have to come again." 

Two of the students from the Social Science Department of the 
University of Minnesota came in and spent the greater part of an after- 
noon. Each of them was assigned from the Social Science Department 
of that institution. One of them said : "We want to know the moti- 
vating influence of Mormonism." The other : "It is my mission to find 
out about the organization and the administration of the Mormon 
Church." When I had spent several hours with them they were totally 
astonished to find that they had only gotten a very small fraction of the 
message of Mormonism, as we are teaching it to the world, and have 
been for the past hundred years. 

While I was touring the mission recently a chief of four thousand 
Indians of the Fort Peck Reservation came to me. He is a member of 
the Catholic Church, but his wife is a Mormon. Every creed, probably, 
that can be found in America is represented among those Indians. He 
said : "We have been together ; we have laid aside all of our differences, 
political and religious, and we have definitely come to the conclusion that 
no one can help us or will help us unselfishly in our problems, except as 
we may be able to get assistance from the Mormon people." 

The banker of Wolf Point, Montana, where these Indians live, made 
a similar request, a chief business man likewise, saying : "We are holding 
certain interests, waiting for the Mormons to come and assist us, for we 
know, through studying their past history, that they will treat our people 
honestly, and teach them how to get the most value from the soil. 

One of the most significant things that has come out of that particular 
gathering of ministers was a request from the editor and publisher of a 
paper that goes to all Veterans. He requested that I should give the 
Latter-day Saint message for his Christmas issue. I modified a previous 
message of the First Presidency, and brought it down to date and made 
it local in touch, and sent it in. I was very much surprised to find that 
they published every single word, a column and a half, and gave my name 
and the address of the headquarters of the mission. 

They came back recently and I gave them a second article as a mes- 
sage f or Easter, on the same line, emphasizing "Peace on earth and good 
will toward men," and love of fellow men rather than war as the Easter 
spirit. 

I was requested, over the phone, by a director or manager of a rail- 



ELDER DAVID A. BROADBENT 



113 



road publication, known as "The National Railroad Review," to take 
space with them, assisting them in a drive for greater state and national 
security from the standpoint of retirement. The principal heading of 
this particular issue, was : "The Inadequacy of Pension, as we have it 
at the present time." 

While I was listening and thinking of the attitude of the Presidency 
of the Church, and our people generally, I determined that I could not 
represent the Church in joining with a company asking that we shall re- 
quire that all men shall be forced to go into retirement at the age of 
sixty-five and may retire at sixty. The thought of President Grant's 
wonderful definition of age, came to me while I still held the phone, and 
I said : "I will take space, and will send the message in." For I knew 
that all our missionaries are receiving concessions from the railroad. 

I read from that particular issue: 

AGE 

Age is a quality of mind : 

If your dreams you've left behind, 

If hope is cold, 
If you no longer look ahead, 
If your ambition's fires are dead, 

Then you're old. 

But if from life you take the best, 
And if in Life you keep the zest, 

If Love you hold ; 
No matter how the years go by, 
No matter how the birthdays fly, 

You are not old. 

Compliments of the Church of Jesus Christ 

of Latter-day Saints. 

3240 Park Avenue, Minneapolis. 

For their next quarterly issue, they said : "We gave you a double 
space for your last article, will you give us another of the same type?" 
I expect, when I return, to find a similar one, this time giving the Prophet 
Joseph Smith's definition of religion and salvation. 

God is blessing us. We are gloriously happy in our mission, and 
the Saints and Elders send greetings. 

May the Lord continue to bless and prosper our eighty-two year old 
youthful Prophet, that he, with his associates, inspired leadership of the 
Church, may continue to guide us into all truth. But I pray more 
fervently — for I know they are being guided — I pray more fervently 
for me and you, and for all Israel, that we shall not sell our birthright 
for a cigarette, a glass of beer, a cup of tea or coffee; or for refusing 
to make the world understand that we are not over-advertised in our 
great Security Program, but that we shall rally to the leadership which 
is ours in making it a reality. 

God grant that his blessings may be upon us all, I pray, through 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 



114 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Wednesday, April 6 



Third Day 



ELDER ABEL S. RICH 

President of the Canadian Mission 

It is indeed a pleasure to be back in the valleys of the mountains, and 
to meet you, my brethren and sisters, and partake of your fine friendliness, 
after having been away for just a short period. 

I am happy to bring you greetings from the Saints and the mission- 
aries in the Canadian Mission, and to tell you that the fine young people 
who have come there as missionaries are well and happy, and doing such 
a splendid and outstanding work that the attention of the people of the 
world is called to them. It is not uncommon to hear people say: "I 
would like to have my son or my daughter grow up to be like those 
missionaries that you have among you." They are coming to us better 
prepared, with earnestness as well as experience. 

I pay tribute to the educational system of Utah, and to the organiza- 
tions of the Church, that train in leadership. I was interested to note 
that half of the missionaries now serving in the Canadian Mission have 
had one or two years college training. I was just a little disappointed to 
note that only half of them have had seminary training. I have noted 
that the additional years of training, and direct responsibility in leader- 
ship in the organizations of the Church, makes them more efficient mis- 
sionaries, and brings them to us very much better prepared. 

The Lord has told us what is expected of the missionary. "A mar- 
velous work," he said, "is about to come forth among the children of 
men. Therefore, O ye who embark in the service of God, see that ye 
serve him with all your heart, might, mind and strength." 

As missionaries, we realize that we may plant and we may cultivate 
and we may water, but it is God that gives the increase. Realizing that 
it is our responsibility to get the message of the restored Gospel of Jesus 
Christ before the people in the clearest and best way possible, we have 
attempted to study the Gospel thoroughly to prepare ourselves, and then 
we have made an effort to reach the people that we have not been reach- 
ing heretofore. 

With this in view we made a good-will tour of the Canadian Mission, 
in an effort to meet the business men of Canada. We were successful 
in arranging meetings with many social clubs : the Rotary, the Kiwanis, 
the Lions' Club, the Kinsman's Club, the Good Will and Optimists' 
Club, and many of the schools. We had a splendid quartet that furnished 
the music. I was privileged to be guest speaker in most of those clubs, 
and was given the opportunity, for thirty or forty minutes, of explaining 
Utah and her people, and the reaction was much more favorable than 
we had hoped for. In the course of the tour we met over thirty thousand 
people — representative business men of Canada — and some of their 
reactions were remarkable. 

After one meeting a man in the club arose and said : "Gentlemen, 
I have been in Salt Lake City. I have been in that historic Tabernacle 
we have been told about. I know that what has been said about that 



ELDER HAROLD W. PRATT 



115 



great building, and that wonderful mission on the Temple grounds, and 
the industry and friendliness of the people of Utah, is true." 

We had such reactions throughout the long tour. We discovered 
through that tour that the people of the world are not irreligious, but 
they are disappointed in finding that they are not obtaining help for 
their personal lives in the churches. 

I read, as possibly you did, in the January number of the Cosmo- 
politan, an article by Dorothy Giles, entitled, "The Wise Men of Science 
Come to the Manger," in which she said that Science is no longer posi- 
tively opposed to Religion, but is seeking diligently to understand it. 
They are seeking to understand the Babe of Bethlehem, what it signifies, 
and its great power over humanity. 

"What can we believe?" she said, we are asking of Science, and 
Science briefly replies : "Religion is not a question of belief, but of 
experience. No matter what the world thinks about religious experience, 
the one who has it possesses a great treasure which has provided him with 
a source of lif e, meaning and beauty, and which has given a new splendor 
to the world and to mankind. He has peace." 

So I have been proud to belong to the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints. We are truly "a city built upon a hill." The eyes 
of the world are turned toward us, and those who have visited us bring 
favorable reports. 

I am happy to be a missionary, and as I think of the hundred and 
eight years of progress of this Church, and the ideals that guided those 
sturdy pioneers, that neither persecution from without nor dissension 
from within, nor the lure of gold, nor the quest of land could turn aside, 
I am happy for the inheritance I have in the Church. 

I pray that our Father in Heaven may continue to bless us as a 
people, that our industry, our love for the principles of truth and right- 
eousness, our brotherly consideration, and this great fraternal friendship 
that has grown up among us, may continue ; and that as the eyes of the 
world are turned toward us, we will continue to be the great missionary, 
for the thing the world wants today is a religion that works in the lives 
of its people in motivating love, in building character, and in doing the 
very things that this great Church has done for us. 

May the Lord bless us, that we may do our part in this great work, 
I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER HAROLD W. PRATT 

President of the Mexican Mission 

My dear brethren and sisters, I feel very humble in occupying your 
time at the end of this conference session, and I pray for your faith and 
prayers while I may occupy this position for a few moments. 

We have been told, and we realize from reading the signs of the 
times, that we are passing through a dangerous evolution, or I should 
say, revolution. Perhaps in Mexico we see more closely and feel more 
intensely this revolutionary movement. Things are happening so rapidly 
that we are unable to keep up, or to foretell what may be the next step. 



116 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Wednesday, April 6 Third Day 

Brother Ballard, in his talk, drew our attention to the fact that we 
are of Israel, that we have been gathered out from among the nations of 
the earth for a glorious purpose, to serve as a city set upon a hill, and to 
guide those who are honest in heart through this perilous revolutionary 
period. He has told us that we are charged with taking the Gospel to 
that remnant of the House of Israel who are not of Ephraim. 

We, in Mexico, have that charge directly. I am glad to report to you 
that we are making progress, that the revolution and evolution there 
going on is indeed the work of our Heavenly Father, preparing that 
people to accept the blessings that have been promised to them through 
their forefathers. 

We see there, however, the power of the Evil One also laboring 
and struggling to win souls away from our Heavenly Father and from his 
cause. We know that he realizes that the time is near at hand when the 
Gospel will be restored to that people, and that he is making every at- 
tempt to thwart those purposes and to make it impossible that those proph- 
ecies be fulfilled. 

But I wish to bear to you my testimony that I know, as I know that 
I live, that this Gospel is true, that it has been restored for the last time, 
and that the prophecies that our Heavenly Father has made will be ful- 
filled. He is doing his part. He is preparing the way. We, my brothers 
and sisters, have the responsibility of carrying out our part also, and we 
can do this only by accepting and adhering to the instructions given by 
our inspired leaders, even those instructions that we have here received 
in this conference. 

I plead with you, my brethren and sisters, to live the Word of Wis- 
dom, as we have been instructed to do ; to pay your tithes and offerings ; 
to rally around the welfare work administration, to support it ; to dem- 
onstrate, with your lives and with your actions, that you do love your 
Heavenly Father with all your heart, might, mind and strength, and that 
you love your neighbor as yourself ; that in very deed we do become and 
continue to be what we are charged with being, — a light unto the world, 
that through our lives and our good works men may come to glorify 
our Father which is in heaven, I pray, in Jesus' name. Amen. 

ELDER MERRILL D. CLAYSON 

President of the Southern States Mission 

I bring to you today the greetings of nineteen thousand Saints, situ- 
ated in sixty-eight branches and ten districts in the Southern States Mis- 
sion. I sincerely trust that the time will come when these sixty-eight 
branches may be christened as wards, and these ten districts as stakes of 
Zion. I only wish, today, that more of our people might be here to enjoy 
the spiritual feast that this conference affords. It is the life-long ambition 
of many of these worthy Saints to have the opportunity, some day, to 
come to this great gathering and enjoy the feast that you people receive 
here. 

I am happy to report to you today that the hundred and twenty-five 
missionaries laboring in the Southern States Mission are well and enjoy- 



ELDER ELRAY L. CHRISTIANSEN 117 



ing their labors. I appreciate with all my heart, and more than words 
can tell, the opportunity of working with your sons and your daughters 
in that mission. Together, we are attempting to solve the problems 
that are presented in carrying the Gospel of Jesus Christ to the honest in 
heart. 

I am grateful that a humble Mormon Elder delivered a Gospel tract 
at my grandmother's house in England, brought her into the Church, and 
thus made it possible for me to be born here in the land of Zion and enjoy 
the wonderful benefits that come to us through the association and influ- 
ence of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. 

Mormonism does more for its members than any other force in all 
the world today. I often think that we do not appreciate its great value, 
influence, and what it has meant to us in our lives. If we were stripped 
of all its truths, of all the influences that it has contributed to our char- 
acter and lives and then stand off to one side and see what is left, I believe 
we would appreciate, more than any other time in our lives, just what 
Mormonism has meant to us. 

Too often people look at Mormonism, accept two or three of its prin- 
ciples that do not conflict with their philosophy and living, and think that 
they are Mormons. Others look upon baptism as the beginning and end 
of their religion. Others use it as a philosophy to ponder over in their 
more serious moods but never make it a part of their lives. The great 
blessings that come to us come through the acceptance of the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ in its completeness. I am sincerely convinced that the paths 
that lead to health and happiness, the paths that lead to progress and the 
abundant life, are paved with the eternal truths of the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ. 

It is my testimony to you people today that Mormonism is a greater 
builder of character and human personality than all the philosophies and 
man-made religions of the world. God bless us and help us to see and 
understand it in its completeness, and live it, and thus bring to ourselves 
health, happiness, progress, and salvation, I ask in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

ELDER ELRAY L. CHRISTIANSEN 

President of the Texas Mission 

I realize that the time I spend here is precious, and I shall attempt 
to be brief as possible. 

I am happy to bring greetings from the Saints and the missionaries 
laboring in the great States of Texas and Louisiana. We have over six 
thousand Saints and about seventy-five missionaries who are diligently 
engaged in spreading the word of the Lord among the people there. We 
feel that we are making definite progress in most respects, and that people 
are increasing their respect for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints, and we are welcome to be heard in most places where we make the 
effort. 

I feel it is a great privilege to labor there and go about feeling the 
Spirit of the Lord guiding us, taking us to the honest in heart. The ac- 



118 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Wednesday, April 6 Third Day 

complishments of these fine missionaries, the testimonies and blessings 
they are receiving give me the assurance that the Lord will bless those 
who obey him. To see them come into the field, humble, untrained, and 
sometimes rough in their ways, then to watch them develop so rapidly 
that they can confound the wise and teach the great, is an inspiration in- 
deed to me. 

I am happy for those young men and women you have sent to us. 
They are all well. I should make one exception. We have one in the 
hospital now, but he is doing very well. Outside of that, they are all in 
good health and happy. And we have some old missionaries as well ; 
three of them. One faithful brother who is sixty-eight years of age this 
month, who before going into the field himself had sent three sons on 
foreign missions and supported them with the labor of his own hands, and 
he is climaxing that service by contributing a great work himself. Besides 
that, another man who has left a family of ten, is happily engaged in the 
work of the Lord, and is bringing results. The third one by accident lost 
a son, and from that accident drew some insurance money. Instead of 
spending that insurance money on a new automobile, or some other thing, 
he spent it serving the Lord on a mission himself, and he claims that it is 
the greatest investment that he ever made. 

We are happy for the faith of the members. They have shown their 
great faith and devotion by a decided increase in their tithes and their 
offerings ; over twenty per cent increase in tithing, and a ten per cent in- 
crease in fast offerings, and they are happy because of that. 

We are simply building on the foundation that has been laid by my 
predecessors, President Peterson, President Rowan and President Ben- 
nion, all of whom have left good names and good works in that field. 

I am thankful for the Temple Block Mission, not alone for the names 
that they send us, with whom we can make contacts, but for the fine im- 
pression of the truth that they give to people who come here. It is a 
great help indeed to have them receive the right understanding and the 
right impression. Most visitors who come here we find have a splendid 
report and opinion of the Latter-day Saints. Anything that any of you can 
do, by your good works to give the right impression and the truth of 
Mormonism, reflects directly back into the mission, and makes our work 
that much more effective. 

How we rejoice when a member from Zion comes into the mission 
field, who is living up to the word of the Lord ! He is a living testimony, 
and he hardly needs to open his mouth to deliver a powerful sermon on 
the virtues of Mormonism. The Lord has told us that he has "sent the 
everlasting covenant into the world, to be a light to the world and to be a 
standard for my people, and for the Gentiles to seek to it ; and to be a 
messenger before my face, to prepare the way before me". 

Brethren and sisters, if we could only realize the importance of this, 
and let the Gospel principles be a standard in our lives from day to day, 
how we should be blessed ! We would find great compensation and joy by 
doing that, even more diligently than we have. The Gospel is a light and 
a guide. We hear it said that this is a lost generation, that there is a 
crisis facing religion, and I believe there is generally. 



ELDER LeGRAND RICHARDS 



119 



I heard an eminent church man, not long ago, declare to his congre- 
gation that what we need now is a realistic, practical theology for the 
world; that divine guidance is the only solution for its problems; that 
there is a need of a prophet among us. He hopes that that prophet will 
soon come forth. 

Thank God that we have that realistic theology, that we have that 
divine guidance, that we have that prophet! Thank the Lord for the 
presence and leadership of Heber J. Grant, our president, and these in- 
spired men who are associated with him. 

Let us be examples to the world. Let us arise and shine forth as the 
Lord has told us to do, and we shall find great joy, as I say, in doing 
good works. Let us determine to be examples and worthy representa- 
tives, and the Lord will bless us. 

I shall not talk longer. I pray the Lord's blessings upon all of you, 
and we want you to pray for us who are working in the mission in Texas 
and Louisiana. We are proud of that great country. It is a beautiful 
portion of our nation, and we are happy to be engaged in the work of the 
Lord there. 

God bless you all, Amen. 

ELDER LeGRAND RICHARDS 

Newly appointed Presiding Bishop of the Church 

I have had the privilege, my brethren and sisters, of standing before 
you upon various occasions in general conference, but I have never felt 
so humble as today. 

I feel very grateful that the Presidency of this Church and the Gen- 
eral Authorities have had confidence enough in me to nominate me to be 
appointed to this new position, and I feel grateful to you, the Latter-day 
Saints, for your sustaining vote. I love these men and I love the Church, 
and I am sure the Lord knows that there is not a place in the world that I 
would not go, because of my love for and testimony of the Gospel. 

I am very happy to be associated with the Latter-day Saints. I am 
grateful for every opportunity of service that has come to me in the past. 
I feel that the Lord owes me nothing. All I have done for the Church 
I have done because I love the Church and because I love the Lord, and 
the Lord does not owe me a thing. I was grateful that I was able to suc- 
cessfully drop back into my business, so that the people would not think 
that I was dependent upon the Church. 

Now I feel that, unless the Lord comes to my aid, I shall be a very 
weak man to follow Bishop Sylvester Q. Cannon. I know him well and 
I love him. He was my mission president when I filled my first mission 
in Holland. He released me from that mission. 

I have watched him and have admired him, and when the President 
told me today that he was going to be sustained as an Apostle I was not 
surprised ; I have always thought that that would be his final appointment 
in the Church. I used to sit as a boy, in the mission field, when he was 
talking to investigators, and watch him. It was as though the light of

Wednesday, April 6 Third Day 

truth was streaming from his eyes, as he explained the glorious principles 
of the Gospel to those who were searching after truth. 

I want to say to you men who bear the Priesthood, and those of you 
who are in positions of responsibility, whom I may be called upon to con- 
tact in this new assignment that has come to me, I hope you will never be 
afraid of me. I hope you will not hesitate to come into my qffice. I hope 
you will feel free to write, if there is anything that I can do to help you. 
I am willing to give all I have, and all the Lord will give to me, to help 
this work roll onward and upward to the destiny which I know the Lord 
has decreed for it. I have often said I wish the world could see it as God 
sees it, and know it as he knows it. Sometimes I wish the Latter-day 
Saints could see it as God sees it, and know it as he knows it. 

I want to say to you that there is no achievement that can ever come 
in the lives of my own children that will be so pleasing to me as to know 
that their lives shall be lives of service to this great Church. 

God bless our leaders, and God bless you, my brethren and sisters, 
and may I enjoy your faith and prayers to enable me to fill my mission as 
the Lord has appointed, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I rejoice beyond expression at the wonderful outpouring of the 
Spirit of the Lord, from our first meeting until the close. The Lord has 
abundantly blessed each and all of us who have been called upon to speak. 

I bless you, as far as the power is in me to do so — and I know that 
I have it — I know as I know the Gospel is true that the Lord wanted me 
to preside over this Church. Brother Joseph F. Smith's last few words 
to me, and the last he gave to any man were : "The Lord knows whom he 
wants to preside over his Church, and he never makes a mistake." By 
the power of the Priesthood of the living God I bless you, one and all, and 
the righteous and honorable men and women all over the world, even so. 
Amen. 

"And the Glory of the Lord," an anthem from The Messiah, by Han- 
del, was sung by the Choir. 

Elder H. Edward Sutton, President of the Oquirrh Stake, offered 
the benediction. 

Conference adjourned for six months. 



The singing at the Monday sessions of the Conference, by the Relief 
Society Singing Mothers, was under the direction of Sister Charlotte O. 
Sackett. J. Spencer Cornwall conducted the singing of the Tabernacle 
Choir at the Sunday and Wednesday sessions. The congregational sing- 
ing was directed by J. Spencer Cornwall and Richard P. Condie. 

Accompaniments and interludes on the great organ were played by 
Frank W. Asper and Wade N. Stephens. 

Stenographic notes of the Conference were taken by Frank W. Ot- 
terstrom and Joseph Anderson. 

Joseph Anderson, 

Clerk of the Conference.

A THRILLING STORY 

of Century One of 

CHURCH HISTORY 

ERE is a new story of "Mormonism," told with a com- 
pleteness and charm that will thrill Latter-day Saints 
with a pride of achievement and at the same time 
win the admiration of the critic, be he friend or foe. In a 
COMPREHENSIVE HISTORY OF THE CHURCH, B. H. 
Roberts has done a masterful piece of research and has set 
down the record of Century One — 1830 to 1930 — in a bril- 
liant appraisal of momentous events. The reader with a 
sentimental interest will be fascinated with this narrative 
of truth stranger than fiction; the reader who approaches 
the new work with the critical vision of the historian will 
find it fair in statement, authentic in fact, copious in detail 
and sound in judgment. 

A COMPREHENSIVE HISTORY OF THE CHURCH was 
written by Elder Roberts at the instance of the First Presi- 
dency of the Church, with a commission to make it exhaus- 
tively complete, from the remotest beginnings to the close 
of the Centennial Conference of April 6, 1930. The final 
volume ends with an account of the Conference itself, mak- 
ing the history technically inclusive of all that happened in 
Century One of the organized existence of the Church. Thus 
it is a fitting commemoration of one hundred years of strug- 
gle and achievement. 

This monumental work is not to be confused with any former 
history, journal or chronicle. Though its nucleus is the his- 
tory of "Mormonism" published a few years ago in 
AMERICANA, running serially for six years through that 
magazine, yet this History is NEW — new in its wealth of 
material, new in method of treatment and new in its physical 
representation of the book maker's art.

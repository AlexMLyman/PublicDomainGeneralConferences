PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

MARVELOUS RECORD OF ATTENDANCE AT CONFERENCES 

I hold in my hand a letter from Brother Walter Cox of Provo. He 
has attended 121 annual and semi-annual Conferences. He is 82 years 
of age, is a full tithepayer, and pays a full Fast donation. He has not 
spent five dollars on doctor bills, and has traveled 25,000 miles to attend 
these conferences. That is a very remarkable record. I am perhaps 
safe in saying that he holds the record, never having missed a Conference 
in sixty years. 

I am very happy to be here; very happy to see this marvelous 
audience. I have thoroughly enjoyed — although statistics are a little 
tedious — the remarkable and wonderful report of the accomplishments of 
the Latter-day Saints during the past year. I am convinced that no other 
people in all the world can compare with the Latter-day Saints in giving 
actual, practical demonstration of faith in the Gospel, of their willingness 
to labor for it, and of their willingness to contribute of their time and their 
means for the advancement and spread of the Gospel at home and abroad. 
It is almost unbelievable that we could do as much as has been reported 
here today, running up into the millions of dollars. We had a very 
severe and bad year because of the low price of our products, and yet, 



14 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Thursday, April 6 First Day 

lo and behold, the actual tithes and Fast-day donations paid are the 
greatest we have had, better than last year. 

INDIVIDUAL TESTIMONIES OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS 

My heart goes out in gratitude to all those who are working at home 
and abroad for the spread of the Gospel. 

I am very thankful indeed that we have the truth. I am very 
grateful that the Latter-day Saints all over the world have a personal, 
individual and abiding testimony of the divinity of the work in which we 
are engaged. But for that testimony men would not think, or women 
either, of making the marvelous sacrifices that they do make at home 
and abroad, for the advancement of the work of the Lord. 

I have mentioned it time and time again, but I never tire of referring 
to it, that we have been preaching the Gospel now for over a hundred 
years, and I have yet to know of any individual who has gone out to 
proclaim the Gospel who has been converted to some other faith. What 
a marvelous thing that is ! Unless we had the truth this could not have 
been accomplished. We have had men of great intelligence, of great 
knowledge, men who have been connected with other churches, who, 
when they heard the Gospel have received it, and in answer to their 
prayers and supplications they have obtained individual testimonies of 
the divinity of the work in which we as Latter-day Saints are engaged. 

A TRIBUTE TO ORSON PRATT AND OTHER LEADERS 

Orson Pratt was one of the great astronomers of the world, one of 
the great mathematicians, one of the greatest students of languages, a 
man with a better knowledge of the Bible, I believe, than almost any 
other man in his day and generation, and when we think of this Gospel 
capturing men of that kind, it is a source of gratitude to us. I am 
grateful when I think of the men who have stood at the head of this 
Church and the leading officials of the same, giving their time and their 
talents, making sacrifices (that is, sacrifices so far as the things of this 
world are concerned), and having a perfect and abiding knowledge that 
God lives, that he hears and answers our prayers ; having a knowledge, 
beyond a shadow of doubt that God did appear to Joseph Smith and did 
introduce his Son to him ; having a perfect knowledge that the Aaronic 
and Melchizedek Priesthoods were restored to the earth by the men who 
held the keys in the Meridian of Time. I am grateful that the Savior 
appeared to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery in the Kirtland Temple, 
and for the wonderful manifestations as recorded in the 76th section 
of the Doctrine and Covenants: 

TESTIMONY OF JOSEPH SMITH AND OLIVER COWDERY 

And now, after the many testimonies which have been given of him, 
this is the testimony, last of all, which we give of him : That he lives ! 

For we saw him, even on the right hand of God ; and we heard the 
voice bearing record that he is the Only Begotten of the Father— 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



15 



That by him, and through him, and of him, the worlds are and were 
created and the inhabitants thereof are begotten sons and daughters unto 
God. 

And this is the Gospel, the glad tidings, which the voice out of the 
heavens bore record unto us — ■ 

That he came into the world, even Jesus, to be crucified for the world, 
and to bear the sins of the world, and to sanctify the world, and to cleanse 
it from all unrighteousness. 

That through him all might be saved whom the Father hath put into 
his power and made by him; 

Who glorifies the Father, and saves all the work of his hands, except 
those sons of perdition who deny the Son after the Father has revealed him. 

GROWTH OF THE CHURCH 

Nothing short of this perfect and absolute knowledge that we 
possess as a people would enable us to accomplish anywhere near the 
things that we are accomplishing. To think that in these days of de- 
pression and trouble we are able to spend milliqns of dollars of money 
to build meeting houses. Nearly every Sunday, for weeks at a stretch, 
I have had to dedicate meeting houses and every time the buildings have 
been full to overflowing with those who have attended these meetings. 
People have labored in some cases for ten long years in raising their share 
of the money to build their meeting house. 

We are growing splendidly. There is a feeling of absolute confi- 
dence ; there is no fear on our part of the final triumph of the work of 
God. This is very gratifying indeed. I can think of nothing more 
remarkable than that when the Prophet Joseph and his brother Hyrum 
and others were sentenced to be shot by a court martial, a man was raised 
up of the Lord to defy the commanding officer and who said it was cold- 
blooded murder. Then the Prophet was imprisoned, with others, where 
he received what to my mind is one of the most remarkable and wonderful 
revelations, one of the greatest of all the revelations ever received by man. 

A REVELATION GIVEN IN LIBERTY JAIL 

I am going to read to you from that revelation received by the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, while he was imprisoned in jail. I am reading 
from the 121st section of the Doctrine and Covenants, starting with 
the thirty-third verse : 

How long can rolling waters remain impure ? What power shall stay 
the heavens? As well might man stretch forth his puny arm to stop the 
Missouri River in its decreed course, or to turn it upstream, as to hinder the 
Almighty from pouring down knowledge from heaven upon the heads of 
the Latter-day Saints. 

Behold, there are many called, but few are chosen. And why are they 
not chosen? 

Because their hearts are set so much upon the things of this world, 
and aspire to the honors of men, that they do not learn this one lesson: 

That the rights of the priesthood are inseparably connected with the 
powers of heaven, and that the powers of heaven cannot be controlled nor 
handled only upon the principles of righteousness. 

That they may be conferred upon us, it is true ; but when we undertake 
to cover our sins, or to gratify our pride, our vain ambition, or to exercise 
control or dominion or compulsion upon the souls of the children of men, in 




GENERAL CONFERENCE 



First Day 



any degree of unrighteousness, behold, the heavens withdraw themselves ; 
the Spirit of the Lord is grieved ; and when it is withdrawn, Amen to the 
priesthood or the authority of that man. 

Behold, ere he is aware, he is left unto himself, to kick against the 
pricks, to persecute the Saints, and to fight against God. 

We have learned by sad experience that it is the nature and disposition 
of almost all men, as soon as they get a little authority, as they suppose, 
they will immediately begin to exercise unrighteous dominion. 

Hence, many are called, but few are chosen. 

May God help you and me and every soul in this Church to be chosen, 
and to stay chosen, in that straight and narrow path that leads to life 
eternal ! 

No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the 
priesthood, only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meek- 
ness, and by love unfeigned ; 

By kindness and pure knowledge, which shall greatly enlarge the soul 
without hypocrisy and without guile — 

Reproving betimes with sharpness, when moved upon by the Holy 
Ghost ; and then showing forth afterwards an increase of love toward him 
whom thou hast reproved, lest he esteem thee to be his enemy ; 

That he may know that thy faithfulness is stronger than the cords of 
death. 

Let thy bowels also be full of charity towards all men, and to the house- 
hold of fajth, and let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall 
thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God ; and the doctrine of the 
priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as the dews from heaven. 

The Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion, and thy scepter an 
unchanging scepter of righteousness and truth, and thy dominion shall be 
an everlasting dominion, and without compulsory means it shall flow unto 
thee forever and ever. 

I repeat this is one of the most marvelous revelations that we have, 
a blessing from God given to the Prophet Joseph while in a jail ! I think 
there is nothing finer in the Doctrine and Covenants. There can be nothing 
of greater importance than to exercise the Priesthood exactly as it is 
explained here. 



I am very thankful indeed for the remarkable success of our Wel- 
fare work thus far ; I am thankful for the devotion so many are giving 
to that work. I am grateful to realize and know that our Heavenly 
Father is directing us ; that he is inspiring us ; that he is leading us by 
his Spirit; that we as a people are growing in those things that are 
pleasing and acceptable to our Heavenly Father. To be able in these 
hard times to make such a report as we have listened to here today, is 
certainly an inspiration to every Latter-day Saint. 

We are the architects — -not only the architects but we are also the 
builders of our own lives. If a man knows the mind and will of the 
Lord and fails to do it, he is drifting away from that straight and narrow 
path that leads to life eternal. 



WELFARE WORK RECEIVES PRAISE 



COLONEL HAWES' COMPLIMENT 



I think there is nothing finer that I have ever received in my life from 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



17 



anyone than a statement that I received from my nearest and dearest 
friend, not a member of the Church, when he wrote a letter to me all the 
way from London, asking about Brother Anthony W. Ivins — what had 
become of him? This man came to my mother's home when I was a 
little boy. He afterwards came and boarded with us, and later came 
with his wife. His first child was born in our home. He was the best 
friend without any exception that I ever had outside of the Church, 
and he was a loyal true friend to our people. 

He said : "I have often said to my wife 'the day will come when 
these two boys, Anthony W. Ivins and Heber J. Grant, will be at the head 
of the Mormon Church; it is in them.' You are an Apostle and the 
president of several companies, but I have never heard of your cousin, 
and really I expected him to outshine you." 

I wrote back and said: "Colonel, your judgment is good. When 
I was made an Apostle I told my wife and mother that I could not 
understand why my cousin was not chosen, that he had forgotten more 
than I knew. 

NOMINATION AS GOVERNOR REFUSED 

"When we secured Statehood I received a telegram from the Demo- 
cratic State convention, asking, 'Where can we find Anthony Ivins? 
We will give him his choice to be nominated for the first congressman, 
now that we have Statehood, or the first governor.' I answered : 'He is 
on the Kaibab Mountain selling the cattle, horses and property of his 
company, he has accepted a call of the Church to go to Mexico.' And if 
there is any one place more than another that he does not want to go to, 
that place is Mexico. He has burned his bridges, has sold his ranch and 
his home, and nothing in the world would tempt him to stay here until 
he is called back again. Afterwards, to show that your judgment is good, 
Colonel, they offered the governorship to me. I told the gentleman, 
Heber M. Wells, who was nominated by the Republican party : 'Here is 
a telegram that may interest you,' and showed the telegram to him. He 
said : 'All right, Heber, if you want that job I shall resign and campaign 
for you. What little I have in the world you helped me to obtain. I feel 
under obligations to you.' I said: 'I will let you know later'." 

PRESIDENT WOODRUFF'S ANSWER 

I showed the telegram to President Woodruff. Those of you who 
knew Brother Woodruff know that he did not speak very slowly. He 
said to me : "Why do you bother me with your telegram ? Haven't you 
enough sense as an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ to answer your own 
telegram, without bothering the President of the Church?" 

I said : "Thanks. Thanks. If you wanted me to run for this 
position you would have said so. Good day." 

I sent a telegram saying : "It will be a personal favor to me if my 
name is not brought before the convention." And it never was. 

I wanted that position awfully bad, but I have never seen the day 



18 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Thursday, April 6 First Day 

since I became the president of the Tooele Stake of Zion, at the time 
I was not yet twenty-four years of age, when I did not want to know what 
the President of the Church wanted, and what the leading officials of 
the Church wanted me to do, and that I did not want to do whatever 
they would have me do, no matter what my personal likes or dislikes 
might be. I have sacrificed my own financial prospects to a great 
extent, among the prospects being the one this dear friend of mine offered 
me, a little job of $40,000 a year when the Church was making me an 
allowance in tithing office orders of $3,600.00. 

EVERYTHING IN A BELIEF INVOLVING FUTURE EXISTENCE 

My friend answered back and said : "My dear Heber : Your nice 
long letter of the 10th came duly to hand. Of course you know, aside 
from the long and intimate personal friendship we have had together, 
how much I have always been impressed with the fineness and the 
sincerity of the men and women who hold your faith. Many times and 
oft I have said in conversation that the only religious people I know who 
live up to their professions are the Mormons of Utah. This is true. 
This it is that inspires respect even where there is a total absence of 
belief in the doctrines of the Church. Your people carry their beliefs 
into daily life and act as if they think there is something in them. I 
cannot see how, as a sensible person, if I had the faith to start with, 
I could do otherwise. For if there is anything in a belief which involves 
an eternity of future existence, there is everything." And he drew a 
big black line under the words "anything" and "everything." 

"If there is anything in a belief which involves an eternity of future 
existence there is everything." 

If you remember nothing that I have said here today excepting that 
one sentence you will not have come here in vain this morning. That 
statement is an absolute fact. 

I wrote the Colonel : "It is a fact, it is not a mere belief. The promise 
of the Savior was, that if any man would do the will of the Father he 
should know of the doctrine, whether it be of God or of man, and we 
Latter-day Saints know of the doctrine." 

KNOWLEDGE MUST BE PUT INTO PRACTICE 

But faith and knowledge without practice are of no value. All the 
knowledge in the world would not amount to anything unless we put 
that knowledge into actual practice. We are the architects and builders 
of our lives, and if we fail to put our knowledge into actual practice and 
do the duties that devolve upon us we are making a failure of life. 

It has fallen to my lot to be in bed for two days under the orders 
of the doctor. I am instructed to stay with you this morning, but to go to 
bed this afternoon, and I think this short speech that I have made (and 
I have tried to make it a little faster than usual so as to get in a little more 
than I otherwise would do) is about all I need to say, because I do not 
want to be criticized when I meet the doctor later. I want you to know 



ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 



19 



that I am not sick and if it were not contrary to the doctor's instructions 
I would stay right here, but he has told me not to come back this after- 
noon, and what is the use of having a doctor if you do not obey him ? 

INVOKES BLESSING 

May the Lord bless you one and all, is my prayer for you. I thank 
God that I know we have the truth. I thank God that I know that 
he lives, that he hears and answers my prayers, that he guides me by his 
Spirit, that he gives me the inspiration of his Spirit to know what to do 
and how to do it for the benefit of his people here on the earth. I thank 
God for the remark made to me by President Joseph F. Smith — the last 
remark that he made before he passed on — "The Lord knows who he 
wants to stand at the head of his Church, and the Lord never makes any 
mistakes. The Lord bless you ; the Lord bless you." 

God bless you one and all. May we never lose the knowledge that 
he lives, that he hears and answers our prayers. May we grow in 
knowledge of Jesus Christ our Redeemer and Savior. May we grow 
in a knowledge that Joseph Smith was in very deed a prophet ; that the 
revelations in the Doctrine and Covenants, given even before the Church 
was organized, have been fulfilled time and time again; that his name 
should be known for good and evil all over the world, and that he should 
suffer persecutions. Finally he was martyred for the cause. May we 
be loyal and true to that prophet and to the Gospel of Jesus Christ is 
my humble prayer, and I ask it in the name of our Redeemer. Amen. 

ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

My dear brethren and sisters : Today, after hearing the splendid 
report of the condition of the Church and the thrilling testimony of 
President Grant, we are all doubly grateful for our membership in this 
great Church. 

Those of us who are fairly certain to be called upon at 'these con- 
ferences are torn between two desires : To bear testimony under the 
influence and inspiration of these vast gatherings to the truth of the 
restored Gospel ; or to speak to some subject that seems of importance, 
perhaps of vital importance, to the Latter-day Cause. For this occasion 
I have chosen the latter course, and should like to discuss with you 
during the time allotted me, the reading habit, and especially the practice 
of the regular reading of the scriptures. It may not be directly a spiritual 
theme ; but I have been impressed from my visits among the Stakes of 
Zion that it is one that needs to be called to the attention of the Latter- 
day Saints. 

BOOKS AN AID TO CIVILIZATION 

Our present civilization, whether for good or ill, really began when, 
about four hundred and fifty years ago, the use of movable type in the 




GENERAL CONFERENCE 



First Dag 



printing press was invented. By means of this invention the thoughts 
of men and the knowledge of the world were distributed in inexpensive 
form among all classes of men. Thereby the prince and the peasant 
were brought to a more common level ; a new freedom was sensed ; the 
minds of men were liberalized; science and its associations came into 
being. We may safely date our present civilization, with its abundant 
knowledge and its freedom and richness of life, from the coming of 
modern printing. 



Latter : day Saints see even more in the coming of this great invention. 
To us it is part of the divine program to prepare the world for the restora- 
tion of the Gospel. Throughout the centuries, the Bible had been 
available only to a few. The cost of producing hand-made copies was 
too great for the common man to meet. The rank and file of the people 
learned of the hand-dealings of God with his chosen people from the lips 
of others, who often changed both words and meaning of the scriptural 
passage. 

The new art of printing soon made the Bible available to all. Learned 
men, lovers of the Lord, were inspired to render the holy scriptures 
into the languages of the common people. The Bible became a household 
possession. The word of God was read around the family fireside of the 
lowly as well as the parlors of the great. Humanity became widely 
acquainted with the eternal law of the Lord. 

Had it not been for the invention of printing with its gift of more 
perfect knowledge of the holy scriptures, and the equally new freedom 
of thought that followed, the coming of the Gospel might have been long 
delayed. In that sense, we may date even the preparatory Gospel period 
from the coming of modern printing. 



When at length the Gospel was restored, the press became one of its 
main allies. The first active work of the Restoration was the translation 
and printing of the Book of Mormon. Soon thereafter, other publi- 
cations were issued, and since that time to the present, printed matter has 
flowed steadily from the presses of the Church, to its members and to the 
people of the world. From its inception in 1830 to this year of 1939, 
the Church has made prolific use of printed materials. 

This vast printed Gospel literature has been of untold value in 
presenting the restored Gospel to the world. Many have come into the 
Church from the reading of the Book of Mormon. Time and again, a 
tract, brought by chance to a person's attention, has led to conversion 
and membership in the Church. A tract in a shoe returned from the 
shoemaker was the first real teacher of the Gospel to my family. Today, 
as the Church spreads over the land, the printed page, in book or peri- 
odical, is becoming increasingly important in keeping Church members, 
everywhere, informed of Church progress, and in maintaining uniformity 



PRINTING OF THE BIBLE A BLESSING 



VALUE OF LITERATURE IN THE CHURCH 



ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 



21 



in Church doctrine and practice. The printed page has been and is a 
powerful means to accomplish the labors that the Lord has laid upon 
his Church. 

FAITH INCREASES BY STUDY OF GOSPEL PRINCIPLES 

Faith itself, the foundation principle of the Gospel, may be developed 
and maintained by use of printed words. Faith is a living thing, subject 
to all the laws of life. It may be begotten ; it may grow ; it may weaken ; 
it may die. Therefore it must be cherished, fostered and fed. Regular, 
continuous Gospel study, through the printed page, is of prime importance 
in the maintaining and growth of certain belief. 

Moreover, faith must be intelligent. Ignorance breeds superstition, 
the opposite of faith. Knowledge is a vital ingredient of the foundation 
of faith. The gaining of knowledge has ever been enjoined upon the 
Latter-day Saints. "Man is saved no faster than he gains knowledge" 
declared Joseph Smith. That means, of course, knowledge of truth, the 
highest expression of which is the Gospel. The position of knowledge 
is high in the Kingdom of God. Reading is a main avenue to knowledge. 

The man who does not add knowledge to knowledge, throughout 
his life, may endanger his very faith. Latter-day Saints should be 
readers ; they should cultivate the reading habit. 

With all this before us, the available evidence indicates that we are 
not a reading people. Our reading seems to be occasional, unsystematic 
and fragmentary. The motion picture, the radio, and the automobile, 
all welcomed by Latter-day Saints, have unduly invaded our reading 
time. These great gifts to man should be enjoyed by all, but they should 
be used wisely and moderately, if our zest for them is to be keen. The 
best of things may be overdone. 

DAILY READING HABIT URGED 

The reading habit is most valuable in life. I mean by that the 
practice of using a little time, say half an hour a day, in the systematic 
reading of worthwhile literature. The mind is opened to precious fields 
of thought ; the achievements of the ages become ours ; even the future 
takes form. As the mind and spirit are fed by well chosen reading, 
comfort, peace and understanding come to the soul. Those who have 
not tried it, have missed a keen and easily accessible joy. 

Moreover, a person who engages in such regular daily reading, if 
only a few minutes a day, in the course of a few years becomes a learned 
man. But it must be a regular, daily habit. It is a common experience 
in the foreign mission field that the less educated man who studies the 
new language without missing a day becomes a more perfect master, and 
that sooner, of the language, than the more highly trained elder, who 
studies the language by fits and starts. Some of the best educated men 
that I have met have never been in college but have acquired the habit 
of daily reading of good books for a few minutes a day. And, may I add, 
this applies to leaders as to the people. 



22 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Thursday. April 6 First Day 

WARNING AGAINST DEMORALIZING LITERATURE 

Of course, reading, as everything else, may be misused. There is 
on our American market a mass of worthless literature, books and mag- 
azines, often sexy, unsound and demoralizing. The land is flooded with 
them ; they are available in every village. They are poisonous offerings 
which too often make up the reading of young and old. It is a type of 
intellectual and spiritual suicide. The effects of such reading are much 
like those of habit-forming drugs, creating unnatural, unhealthy desires, 
and weakening both body and mind. Such time as we do give to reading 
should be devoted to carefully selected literature, high grade magazines 
and books, which cost no more, but build up the mind, and feed the 
spirit of man. 

THE GOSPEL TO BE STUDIED IN THE PRINTED WORD 

However, let it be remembered that no practice surpasses that of 
reading daily from the sacred scriptures of the Church, and from the 
expositions of Church history and doctrine by competent writers on 
Gospel subjects, found in the books, pamphlets and periodicals issued by 
the Church. The Gospel is a vast system of truth, of such eternal meaning 
that it is never exhausted. The more it is studied, the more interesting 
and appealing it becomes. And, the opened vistas of truth that come to 
the earnest student of the scriptures, increase and maintain faith in the 
truth and reality of the Gospel. Knowledge of the Gospel is food for 
faith in the Gospel. Only by careful and continued study can a vision 
of the majesty of the Gospel be won. Many a spiritual failure may be 
traced to Gospel starvation. 

I fear that too many Latter-day Saints know the Gospel only super- 
ficially, and take most of it for granted, without making the effort of 
inquiry. This is in direct contradiction to the Gospel principle that every 
member of the Church must, as it were, stand upon his own feet, and 
know for himself that the Gospel is true. The words of the Lord are 
clear : "And the Book of Mormon and the holy scriptures are given of 
me for your instruction, and the power of my spirit quickeneth all things." 

I urge upon all Latter-day Saints to read the scriptures, thoughtfully, 
every day. In some households it may even be possible to read a chapter 
from the scriptures before the evening meal begins, when the family 
are seated around the table. The practice is helpful to young people. 

SCRIPTURES A GUIDE TO RIGHT LIVING 

Whoever has failed to read the scriptures has missed much in life. 
The beauty and eloquence of language, and the sublimity of ideas, found 
in the Bible, are not even approached in any man-made literature. The 
simple faith, and clear exposition of eternal truth, in the Book of Mor- 
mon, are as a light on the path of life. The solemnity of thought, and 
the echo of the voice of the Lord, in the Doctrine and Covenants, guide 
men in the actions of their lives. And the picture of the eternal love of 



ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 



23 



God for his children as set forth in the Pearl of Great Price makes the 
human heart swell with joy. We may well pity the man who does not 
know the scriptures of the Lord. 

If mankind would turn daily to the word of God as found in the 
scriptures there would be less of warfare and misery, and the dawn of 
peace would be seen. 

PUBLICATIONS OF THE CHURCH 

Much of our reading may be supplied, in addition to the standard 
Church works, by the splendid publications of the Church. The Deseret 
News is a most excellent source of live news, none better, for all who live 
within the radius of its operations. Every Latter-day Saint family so 
located which seeks a daily newspaper should subscribe to the Deseret 
News. Several magazines appeal to special groups within the Church : 
The Improvement Era, the organ of the Priesthood quorums, Mutual 
Improvement Associations, Department of Education, Music Committee, 
Ward Teachers, and others ; the Relief Society Magazine representing 
the great body of mature women in the Church, represented here today 
by these 1300 melodious Singing Mothers ; The Instructor, for all Sunday 
School workers ; The Children's Friend for children under the direction 
of the Primary Association ; and The Genealogical and Historical Mag- 
azine, organ of the Genealogical Society of Utah. Besides, there is a 
somewhat steady flow from Church headquarters of books and pamphlets 
dealing with the Gospel and related subjects. 

While it may not be expected that every family shall possess and 
read all this material, yet I have a feeling that those who complain most 
about our wealth of Church literature, are those who read that literature 
least. Those who do give some time regularly to our Church literature 
keep up with the progress of the Lord's mighty work, and also increase 
in Gospel knowledge and Gospel power. 

ADVICE GIVEN TO HYRUM SMITH 

Before the Church was organized, Hyrum Smith became convinced 
of the truth of his brother's message, and with the fiery zeal of the new 
convert, desired to go out to preach the Gospel. But, the Lord restrained 
him and asked him to wait a while. "Seek not to declare my word," 
said the Lord, "but first seek to obtain my word. . . . Study my word 
. . . until you have obtained all which I shall grant unto the children of 
men in this generation, and then shall all things be added thereto." This 
divine counsel given to Hyrum Smith may well be taken to heart by us of 
this day. By the study of God's word, we shall not only have the visions 
of the Gospel opened before us, but our faith will increase and we shall 
be better able to do our part in carrying forward the latter-day cause 
of the Lord, for our own welfare and that of our fellow men. 

GRATITUDE FOR THE GOSPEL 

I am grateful for the Gospel, and its advancement among the children

of men ; for its truth which throws light into the dark corners of life ; 
and for the faith which every man may win who but seeks it, which 
declares the reality of the Gospel and all its claims; for the written 
word to guide and comfort us. As a people we must cherish the gift 
of the Gospel, increase our faith by adding knowledge to knowledge and 
good works to better works. 

May the Lord help us so to do, I ask in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 



ELDER DAVID A. BROADBENT 

President of the North Central States Mission 

My brethren and sisters : If we are to "work out our own salvation 
with fear and trembling," I made considerable progress six months ago 
when I sat here through six long meetings fearing and waiting for this 
opportunity and then did not get it. 

I value above all else in the world my membership in this Church. 
I take it that it is not expected, nor is it my privilege to preach the 
Gospel to the Saints at home; my appointment is to those abroad in 
the world. 

We have a fine group of men and women, your sons and daughters 
— eighty-two in number at present — laboring in the North Central States 
Mission. They are all well, they are all happy in their labors and 
rejoicing in the privilege that is theirs to be representatives of this 
great Church. 

As Pasteur seems to have proven definitely that "only life can 
produce life," I am becoming quite convinced during a period of less 
than two years of presiding in our mission that only effective Church 
training can produce effective missionaries. We have missionaries of 
all grades of scholastic training, but neither scholarship nor technical 
theological knowledge makes successful missionaries ; but almost without 
exception, he or she who has come up through the training of the organi- 
zations of our Church, and from homes wherein is found a testimony of 
the Gospel in which our youths and maidens have imbibed the spirit of 
the Gospel, these are ready to enter immediately into active service when 
they arrive in the mission field, regardless of their intellectual training. 
In saying this I am not unmindful of the fact that "the glory of God 
is intelligence" and that "a man is saved no faster than he gains 
knowledge," yet learning has to be made over into wisdom and we have 
to make ourselves sensitive to the power of the Lord. As the humble 
fishermen in the days of Christ proved superior to the trained Rabbi, so 
our missionaries, male and female, who are "born again," in spite of 
their lack of worldly knowledge prove to be strong expounders of the 
restored Gospel. These touch the hearts of men great and small as 
measured by the world. These touch the heart and demonstrate the 
scriptural truth that "No one can say that Jesus is the Christ except by 
the Holy Ghost." 



ELDER DAVID A. BROADBENT 



25 



I find definite and constant evidence in the mission field that those 
who have not been trained in our homes and in our organizations, that it 
takes these almost as long as though they were in a foreign field having 
to master a foreign language, to become real ambassadors of the truth. 
Unless we are "born again," and I take it that when Christ said this to 
Nicodemus he meant just what we find with our young men and 
women in the mission field, not a mere immersion in water, but a real 
new birth of the Spirit of this great cause of which he is the founder. 
Until our men and maidens are born again they are almost worthless as 
missionaries. And yet, the greatest miracle in the Church, as I view it, 
is to be seen in the growth and development of each one when he finds 
himself under the inspiration of his divine calling and appointment. 
Nothing now seems to hinder him from becoming a great and worthy 
representative of the Church. 

There is no question in my mind but that any of our youths can 
make good in the mission field if they have come from homes of Latter- 
day Saints who are keeping the commandments of God and have had 
the proper training in the Church organizations. Solomon did not say, 
"Teach a child in the way he should go," but he said "Train up a child 
in the way he should go and when he is old he will not depart from it." 
The training is by far greater than is the intellectual attainment that we 
get from mere teaching. The fishermen of old, those whom Christ 
selected from the shores of Galilee, were not scholarly men, but under 
the spirit and power of the inspiration of Almighty God they were 
unequaled in solving the problems of life in their day, and it is similar 
today. Knowledge, a great fund of information, is valuable, the more 
we have the better, provided we have that inspiration which comes only 
from a divine source; for "knowledge is power" when applied, but 
it cannot be applied in the mission field effectively except when used 
under the spirit of a testimony of the Gospel of Christ. 

We are often responsible for the non-conversion of those among 
whom we labor because we have not learned "that the rights of the 
Priesthood are inseparably connected with the powers of heaven, and 
the powers of heaven cannot be controlled nor handled only upon 
the principles of righteousness." 

I rejoice in the privilege that is given me and my family and to 
those who are laboring joyously with us in speaking for this Church. 
I know it to be the Church of God as I know that I live. I will go to the 
ends of the earth any time, anywhere under this inspired leadership 
which is ours, no matter where the call may be. I know that God lives, 
I know that Jesus is the Christ, I know that Joseph Smith is his prophet 
and that he was the medium in the hands of God in restoring the ever- 
lasting Gospel. I know full well that every man who has succeeded him 
as President of the Church to the present time is a prophet of God. Only 
those who are not in tune with the spirit of this Gospel stand in 
criticism of the leadership that is ours today. 

God bless us. God give us power that we may fill our responsi- 
bilities to his name's honor and glory and for our own blessing and

benefit. I have learned that every commandment of God, every in- 
junction is for my benefit and blessing. I see even in the commandment 
to Adam and Eve when cast from the garden of Eden and the "earth 
was cursed for man's sake," that this "cursing" was in reality a great 
blessing. It was a privilege to work. If we do not sweat with work 
we shall sweat with disease. This was not a cursing of the earth for the 
cursing's sake, but that man should be compelled to work that he might 
be permitted to develop in service, that we might grow through achieve- 
ment. 

God grant that we may see our opportunities in this great Church 
and lend our entire support to it, I pray through Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER ORLANDO C. WILLIAMS 

President of the Spanish- American Mission 

My brethren and sisters : Following in Brother Broadbent's steps, 
I can say amen to his opening remarks. I wish to say that I am happy to 
be with you and I have thrilled to the testimonies we have heard this 
morning, and particularly was I thrilled again by the voice of our prophet 
leader and by his testimony. I feel that his vigor, his clear-cut testimony, 
and his quoting of the scriptures to us are a challenge to every member 
of this Church, and particularly to the missionaries and those who hope 
to be missionaries. I feel also that his life is an example to all of us, 
which we can well follow, and we know that he has reaped the benefit of 
the scripture in the statement that "Sacrifice brings forth the blessings 
of heaven." 

And if we in a small measure would enjoy the blessings of our 
Heavenly Father while we are here upon this earth we should also follow 
that injunction, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness ; 
and all these things shall be added unto you." 

I wish to report that the missionaries — sixty-three of them, your 
sons and daughters — in the Spanish-American Mission are well and happy 
in their work. We have enjoyed better health so far this year in the 
mission than at any other time since I have presided over it, and for this 
we are grateful. Their testimonies are growing, they are becoming 
more useful day by day, and by the blessings of our Heavenly Father 
the work is going forward among those with whom we are laboring. 
The Branches and Sunday Schools of the mission are being strengthened, 
they are being better organized, the people feel a new strength, a new 
desire to go forward in the work of the Lord, and they are happy in the 
work. It is a pleasure above all else that I have enjoyed to represent the 
Church in a mission in the world, and it is a pleasure for your sons and 
daughters to preach the Gospel of the Lord and Master, that others may 
be brought to a knowledge of the same. 

We depend on your faith and prayers at home, and the report we 
have received this morning of the growth and the strength of this Church 
will be an added inspiration and stimulus to us to carry on in the work 



ELDER SAMUEL 0. BENNION

that is before us. We have often heard it preached that after this life 
we would sit on a golden throne and play a golden harp or sing songs, 
and while we know that this is not so, I do hope that there will be 
"Singing Mothers" in heaven, because I have been inspired this morning 
by their songs and by the spirit of the same. In some of the missions 
we have a lack of choirs that are properly trained. Ofttimes the mis- 
sionaries are unable to sing the songs of Zion as we would love to have 
them do, to carry the spirit that comes through singing, but we are 
trying to develop the talents that are natural to our people, and where 
there is a large enough congregation in our Branches we are developing 
that part of the work. 

The Lord has poured out his Spirit upon us, and recently in a tour 
of the mission we reached over three thousand people who are not 
members of the Church, and were able to preach the Gospel to them. 
The work of the mission quartet was outstanding, and it has opened the 
doors of many hundreds of people to our missionaries. The missionaries 
report that in nearly every instance the doors are open to them, and all 
we need is more missionaries to help take care of the work, to preach 
the Gospel to those who are anxiously awaiting it. I feel with you 
that the motto of this people is, onward and forward, in a progressive 
movement that is natural and normal, although I believe it will be more 
phenomenal in the future than it has been in the past. 

I wish to leave with you my testimony that I know that God lives, 
that his Only Begotten Son was the Christ, sent to the earth to redeem 
mankind, and that only by living the commandments that he gave us will 
we be saved. I also bear you my testimony that our leaders are inspired 
men, that they are placed here in authority over us, that they are doing 
the work that God intended that they should do, and that if we will only 
follow their counsel and advice we will be in the way of salvation. This 
I leave with you humbly in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER SAMUEL O. BENNION 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 
The Savior said, as recorded in the Gospel of St. Matthew : 

Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot 
be hid. 

Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a 
candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house. 

Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good 
works, and glorify your Father which is in Heaven. (Matt. 5: 14-16). 

PROPER LEADERSHIP NEEDED 

In these troubled times the Latter-day Saints have a great oppor- 
tunity to bring to mankind a necessary type of leadership. Serious prob- 
lems confront young and old alike. Many are sorely tried through eco- 
nomic difficulties. Others are being lured away by the wicked who conspire 



28 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Thursday. April 6 First Day 

to get gain through merchandising the souls of the people. Yet the major- 
ity of the people desire that which is good. Generally they are willing to 
do right, if they are properly directed. 

In every neighborhood and community there is a demand for lead- 
ership and faith to dispel perplexity and implant a firmness of purpose 
which all men need in these troublesome times. An outstanding figure 
in every circle has the power to influence his associates, and if that in- 
dividual has a true conception of leadership, he may become a blessing — 
not only to his immediate circle, but to his community, his Church, his 
state and nation. 

THE POWER TO DEVELOP LEADERSHIP 

Frequently we hear men and women lamenting the lack of per- 
sons upon whom they may depend to step out and take a directing 
position in their organizations. We hear this from many of our own 
people who seem to forget that we have the power within the Church to 
develop the finest kind of leadership known upon earth ; not only individ- 
ual leadership, but collective leadership, which in turn can make of this 
people a mighty power for good in the world. It has already done so to the 
extent that now in many places, the Latter-day Saints are recognized for 
what they really have accomplished. We can and must carry this pro- 
gress still further, until we truly become as a city on a hill, a beacon light 
in the dark of night, setting an example in the art of living which will 
attract the gaze of thinking people everywhere. 

To do this will require the united effort of the members of the 
Church and the perpetuation of the high standards and high ideals fost- 
ered by the Church. We must provide the leadership in our wards and 
branches to achieve this purpose. 

FIRST ELEMENT OF TRUE LEADERSHIP 

If we are to do so we must learn that the first element of true 
leadership is faith in God and obedience to his principles. This truth 
has been recognized all down the ages. We are all familiar with the ex- 
ample of Saul who lost his position as a leader and king of Israel because 
of his failure to obey the command of the Lord as given through Samuel 
the prophet. The essence of the rebuke uttered then is pertinent today. 

Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as 
in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, 
and to hearken than the fat of rams. (1 Sam. 15 :22). 

We are equally familiar with the blessings and strength of leadership 
which came to Nephi as a result of his willingness to obey the teachings 
of his father Lehi. 

If we would succeed in developing true leadership within our own 
groups, then let us remember that the first essential is to follow willingly 
the advice and counsel of those who preside over the Church. 



ELDER SAMUEL O. BENNION

LEADERSHIP THROUGH CHURCH ACTIVITY 

The next step is activity. Experience has shown us that the great 
developer of leadership among the Latter-day Saints is activity in the 
Church — participation in the programs of the various quorums and aux- 
iliary organizations. How many times have you seen men or women 
weak and trembling from inexperience, when placed in positions of re- 
sponsibility grow into stalwarts in the Church, as they have assumed the 
mantle of their calling and diligently endeavored to build up the kingdom 
of God here upon the earth ? 

You have also seen young men called on missions who have seemed 
weak and timid, but when they have returned after two years or more 
of active service in the mission field, you have seen a transformation you 
could hardly have believed possible. Why ? Because they have developed 
the qualities of leadership through their persistent activity in the Church. 

There is no better evidence of the fact that activity in the Church 
develops the quality of leadership in the lives of the Latter-day Saints than 
in the careers of the men who have presided over the Church. 

The humble beginning of the Prophet Joseph Smith is well known. 
His education was limited. He was obliged to start work early in his life 
to contribute to the support of himself and other members of the family. 
Yet from that humble beginning he became one of the greatest prophets 
of all time. He not only became the dynamic leader of a fast-growing 
modern Church, but he set forth principles of government worthy of 
study by our greatest statesmen and in the latter part of his life became 
a candidate for president of the United States. 

He was a great colonizer in the central west, and envisioned the 
eventual movement of the Pioneers to the Rocky Mountains. He became 
one of the great leaders of all time, and all this through his activity and 
faith and obedience to God and the Church of Christ. 

Brigham Young likewise had a humble beginning. He was a trades- 
man in very ordinary circumstances. When he joined the Church and 
entered heartily into its activities he began the development of traits of 
leadership which today are being heralded in motion pictures, over radio 
broadcasts and among men trained to measure greatness in the perspective 
in the passing of time. He successfully directed the emigration of the 
Latter-day Saints to Utah and later the colonization of a large section 
of western America. All of this grew out of his activities in the Church, 
out of giving his time and talents unselfishly to the development of the 
Kingdom of God. 

President Taylor, President Woodruff, and President Snow also 
had humble beginnings. They, too, rose from the ranks and achieved 
greatness through their untiring service in the Church. 

Many of those within the sound of my voice remember President 
Joseph F. Smith. Few boys had a more humble beginning than he. 
Deprived of both of his parents early in life, he was obliged to work 
hard for a living, but he gave himself freely to the work of the Lord. 
Through active service in the Church he developed rare qualities of 



30 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Thursday. April 6 First Day 

leadership. As he served, he grew in power, until the time came when 
he stood at the head of the Church, giving it an inspired administration. 

President Grant on various occasions has told us of the humble 
beginning he had; and of his weakness in going to preside over the 
Tooele Stake as a young man. But when we regard the President as 
he is today, we are inspired by the greatness of his leadership, and his 
faith in the work of the Lord. 

Few men have received the high tributes of love and esteem that 
have come to him. Yet every tribute has been earned by continuous 
unselfish service in behalf of his fellowmen. Through his inspired 
leadership he today directs the religious affairs of nearly a million 
members of the Church in all parts of the world. 

And how did he achieve this power of leadership ? We answer : 
Through service in the Church of Christ our Lord. 

Every one of us wields some influence among those with whom 
we associate. No matter in what capacity we may serve, we can develop 
qualities of leadership through unselfish service in the Church. We 
then shall grow in power and influence and thus shall we learn the 
truth of these words : 

Whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister ; 
And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant. 
(Matt. 20:26,27). 

BETTER QUALIFIED TO PREACH GOSPEL 

If we collectively grow in our obedience to God's commands and 
increase our activity in his Church, we shall be in better position to 
teach the Gospel to all the world, and to teach more impressively because 
of the kind of lives we live. 

The world today is sorely in need of the principles of the Gospel. 
In America we have an abundance of gold and silver and foodstuffs, 
and much intellectual power, but we lack the desire to worship God. 
All must be brought to a knowledge of this condition and learn to 
repent of their transgressions. 

The Latter-day Saints hold the key to this situation — the inspired 
words of God that have come to the children of men from the time of 
the beginning of this Church, inspiring those great leaders even until 
now, must be taken into consideration by the doubter and by those who do 
not know. 

We pray for the children of men in all the world, in this city where 
we live, the country round about us, and in all nations of the earth. 
We pray God to give us the power to do our part, and we do it in 
the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I am very grateful myself, and I am sure that you all are, to the 
Singing Mothers for the lovely music to which we have listened ; we ap- 
preciate it very much indeed. 

AVOID AUTO ACCIDENTS 

Our City Fathers have requested us one and all to be careful of 
automobile accidents. I want to ask as a personal favor that people quit 
breaking the speed limit in this city. If they happen to see a green light 
you would think that someone was dying, the way they try to get there 
before it changes to a red light ; you would think that life and death were 
at stake. I have had automobiles pass me time and time again when I was 
going just the speed limit, and then they generally get to the light too 
late and the red light comes on. If the city would pass an ordinance to 
the effect that every one should send in the name of every man who 
passes him breaking the speed limit, trying to get through the green light, 
and if they would take the testimony of that one person, provided there 
was no other person to testify to it, I think they would collect in fines 
about a thousand dollars a day in this city. There is no necessity to 
break the speed limit, none whatever, and of course there is no necessity 
of always trying to get your right-of-way when it is your turn. 

Here lies the body of William Gray, 
Who died maintaining his right of way. 
Now William was right as he sped along, 
But he's just as dead as if he'd been wrong. 

Let the other fellow have the right-of-way. 

An anthem, "O Bread of Life," was sung by the Singing Mothers. 
Elder Hyrum B. Calder, President of the Uintah Stake, offered the 
closing prayer. 

Conference adjourned until 2 p. m. 

FIRST DAY 
AFTERNOON MEETING 

President J. Reuben Clark, Jr., First Counselor in the First Presi- 
dency, presided at the second session of the Conference, which convened 
promptly at 2 o'clock p. m., Thursday. President Heber J. Grant was 
absent, on account of suffering from a cold. 

The music for this session was furnished by the Singing Mothers, 
under the direction of Wade N. Stephens. 

The Singing Mothers and the congregation sang the hymn "High on 
the Mountain Top." 

Elder Claudius Hirschi, President of the Zion Park Stake, offered 
the opening prayer. 

The Singing Mothers sang the hymn "For the Strength of the Hills."

ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

Since April 6 of this year, 1939, is Thursday, and since our Annual

ANSWERS TO PRAYER CITED 

I desire now to make a few remarks on the subject of prayer. We 
have already been urged today to read the scriptures. 
Isaiah says : 

Seek ye the Lord while he may be found ; call ye upon him while he 
is near. (Isa. 55 :6.) 

Jesus himself says: 

Ask, and it shall be given you ; seek, and ye shall find ; knock, and it 
shall be opened unto you : For everyone that asketh receiveth ; and he that 
seeketh findeth ; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened. (Matt. 7 :7-8) 

Our forefathers came to this country in search of religious freedom, 
religious tolerance, and real liberty. In our national anthem we sing: 




GENERAL CONFERENCE 



First Day 



Then conquer we must, for our cause it is just, 
And this be our motto, In God is our trust. 



That is the motto of the country "over which flies the only flag in all the 
world that has never known defeat," to quote Lloyd George. 
And again we sing : 



And we members of the Church of Jesus Christ believe that the only king 
this our country shall ever know is Jesus, the Son of God. 

It is said that in our country today some of our leaders in business, 
many who are called empire builders, actually ridicule religion. A wise 
and thoughtful American has said : 

These very men are indebted for all that they possess to the family 
prayers which were once held daily in the homes of their fathers. (Babson) 

Many of our great Americans, you will recall, have been prayerful 
men. Franklin said : 

I have lived a long, long time, and the longer I live the more convincing 
proofs I see of this fundamental truth, that God governs in the aifairs of 
men. 

He approached the unselfishness of the divine when in his prayer- 
ful appeal he said : 

For my friends, and for their prosperity, and for the fewness of my 
enemies, Father, I thank thee. 

Great is the respect and great the admiration we have for George 
Washington as he went upon his knees in those trying days at Valley 
Forge and appealed to our Heavenly Father that his powerful hand might 
be stretched forth to bring success to the armies of our colonies in their 
struggle for liberty. 

Lincoln, during those days in which our country was torn with war, 
set apart the 30th of April, 1863, as a day of fasting and a day of prayer, 
and as he did so he said : 

We have received the choicest blessings of heaven ; we have been pre- 
served in peace and prosperity these many years ; we have grown in num- 
bers, strength, wealth and power as no other nation has ever grown. But, 

he added: 

The great difficulty with our nation is, we have forgotten God. 

I am wondering if that condition prevails today. 
He says further: 

And we have vainly imagined in the deceitfulness of our hearts that 
this unusual outstanding success that has come to our country has been due 
to some superior wisdom or virtue of our own. 

Then he appeals to the people of the United States to assemble in their 



Long may our land be bright 
With freedom's holy light; 
Protect us by thy might, 



Great God our King. 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN

various places of worship, to call their families together around their 
own hearthstones, and to appeal to our Heavenly Father with a hope 
that the united appeal of the people will transform what was then our 
war-torn country into its former condition of happiness and peace. 
A great American has written: 

Daily we assembled in Independence Hall when we were struggling 
for independence, and daily we offered appeals to Divine Providence for 
his guidance and for his help, and our prayers were heard and they were 
graciously answered. 

I am just wondering if we the people of the United States have forgotten 
our powerful Friend. 

AN APPEAL FOR FAMILY PRAYERS 

A survey was made by the United States government in 1930 and 
revealed among other things that only one in eight of white American- 
born children in the seventh, eighth and ninth grades of the schools of 
the United States participate in family prayers. While many more than 
this attend church, the survey also showed that in the cities only thirty 
per cent, and in the country only thirty-eight per cent of the people ask 
a blessing on their food at meal times. 

The record of conditions in our own Church of course is far better 
than this, but I am wondering in how many of our homes we fail to par- 
ticipate in family prayers, — in how many of our homes we do not express 
our gratitude and thankfulness for the food we have to eat. And fearing 
that perhaps we too may also be forgetting our Father in heaven, that 
powerful Friend that gave support to our forefathers, the struggling 
colonies in America, to gain their independence, that powerful Friend 
who can always hear and who led our fathers in their matchless march 
across the desert and directed them in their struggles to establish here in 
the tops of these mighty mountains the "mountain of the Lord's House," 
— I say it is because I fear that we may be forgetting this our powerful 
Friend that I am making this appeal to you who are here assembled and 
to you who are listening in and to the people of the Church generally, 
to participate in family prayers. And I appeal not only for participation 
in family prayers, but for participation in secret prayers, and for partici- 
pation in that sacred hour of worship known as our sacrament meetings. 
On these occasions it seems to me there is perhaps an opportunity to come 
into a closer communion with our Heavenly Father than at any other 
time. 

If we assemble in our sacrament meetings and there with eyes closed, 
heads bowed and hearts filled with a prayerful spirit, we appeal humbly 
and earnestly to our Heavenly Father for our shortcomings to be over- 
looked, for our sins to be forgiven ; if there we appeal for strength and 
power to carry out our renewed resolutions, then we shall have awakened 
in our souls that faith which is the grain of mustard seed which makes 
nothing impossible. 

Prayer, whether in the family, in secret, or as a part of our sacrament 
or other religious service, is something more than words ; it is a condition 



36 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Thursday. April 6 First Day 

of the soul. It is an expression of affection for f ellowmen ; it is a some- 
thing that emphasizes that great principle, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor 
as thyself." The Savior reached perfection in unselfishness when upon 
the cross he prayed, "Father, forgive them for they know not what they 
do." (Luke 23:34.) 

Surely we can never forget that the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints was established again upon the earth as the result of 
the prayer of faith uttered by a boy, age fourteen, after he had read in 
the Holy Book and believed the words, "If any of you lack wisdom, let 
him ask of God." (James 1:5.) Had this divine message made a less 
profound impression upon the mind of that boy and if he had not had faith 
enough to appeal for light and guidance, I am wondering how and when 
and under what condition the Church of the Master might then have been 
restored to the earth. 

If it was necessary for the Savior to offer his prayers daily, if it 
was necessary for him, being divine, to appeal with such earnestness and 
such regularity to our Heavenly Father, if it was necessary for the Pro- 
phet Joseph Smith to make prayerful appeals so frequently and so earn- 
estly to our Heavenly Father, how much more is it necessary for us to 
do this ! 

JOSEPH SMITH'S PRAYER IN LIBERTY JAIL 

President Grant read this morning a part of section 121 of the Doc- 
trine and Covenants. To give you some idea of the earnestness with 
which the Prophet made his appeals I am going to read the first part of 
that same section 121 — a prayer of the Prophet : 

O God, where art thou ? * * How long shalt thy hand be stayed, and 
thine eye, yea thy pure eye, behold from the heavens the wrongs of thy 
people and of thy servants, and thine ear be penetrated with their cries? 

Yea, O Lord, how long shall they suffer these wrongs and unlawful 
oppressions, before thine heart shall be softened toward them, and thy 
bowels be moved with compassion toward them? 

O Lord God Almighty, maker of heaven, earth, and seas, and of all 
things that in them are, * * stretch forth thy powerful hand ; let thine 
eye pierce ; * * let thy hiding place no longer be covered ; let thine ear be 
inclined ; let thine heart be softened, and thy bowels moved with compassion 
toward us. * * 

Remember thy suffering saints, O our God; and thy servants will re- 
joice in thy name forever. 

No revelation was ever thrust upon the Prophet. These came only 
as a result of solemn, earnest, prayerful appeals for help and guidance. 
He says the Lord responded to his supplications. Revelations were re- 
ceived in answer to the Prophet's supplications and inquiries. Words to 
this effect are found in the preliminary statements in the Doctrine and 
Covenants to practically all the revelations which were given to the 
Prophet. Only faith and faithfulness and earnest, devoted appeals 
brought the light and guidance and inspiration of heaven in the form 
of revelations. 

I repeat, if it was necessary for the Savior himself and for the Proph- 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN

et to make these earnest and frequent appeals to our Heavenly Father, 
how much more is it necessary for us to do so. 

QUOTATIONS FROM A YOUNG MAN'S LETTER 

To give you something of the spirit of one of our Latter-day Saint 
homes, I have here a quotation from a young man reared in one of our 
Latter-day Saint families. I wonder if he describes the condition that 
prevails in our homes today: 

Daily, he says, we had our family prayers. In father's absence mother 
was in charge, and she would either lead in prayer or call on one of us chil- 
dren to do so. However, when father was present he always did the praying, 
and what beautiful, what wonderful prayers they were! It seemed to me 
that he always talked to Divinity in the same familiar manner and matter- 
of-fact way as if he were conversing with a friendly comrade who sat before 
him as he kneeled. In my later years as I have been cognizant of the hatred, 
the strife, the bitter jealousy and turmoil in the hearts of men, the desire 
or willingness of many to take unfair advantage of their neighbors, and the 
absence of the spirit of brotherly love and kindly charity in so many places 
in the world, I have many times thought that if every home in the land 
could hear such prayers daily by the head of the family as my parents used 
to utter in great humility and earnest sincerity and in kindly confidence and 
cordial good will, expressing genuine devotion and brotherly anxiety for the 
welfare of mankind, then the reign of love and peace and good will upon the 
earth, the great difficulties between man and man, and nation and nation, 
would quickly vanish and the threatening clouds of war and trouble would 
disappear. (Dr. M. C. Merrill) 

ADMONITION TO SEEK THE LORD 

I will conclude as I began, with the words of Isaiah : 

Seek ye the Lord while he may be found ; call ye upon him while he is 
near. 

And those impressive words of the Savior also, 

Ask, and it shall be given you ; seek, and ye shall find ; knock, and it 
shall be opened unto you : For everyone that asketh receiveth ; and he that 
seeketh findeth ; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened. 

May we be faithful ; may we be devoted to our Heavenly Father ; may 
we remember our daily prayers, and our secret prayers; may we join in 
the prayers offered in our places of worship, that the work of the Lord 
may go on with more rapidity and speed. And I humbly pray that our 
appeals may be made in faith believing, that our prayers may ascend to 
the throne of grace, that they, united with the prayerful appeals of all 
good people, may help to bring that peace on earth and good will to men 
which is to follow conversion to the Gospel of Jesus Christ.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



First Day 



ELDER STEPHEN L RICHARDS 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

What is man that Thou art mindful of him, and the son of man, that 
Thou didst visit him? 

For Thou hast made him a little lower than the angels and hast crowned 
him with glory and honor. 

Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of Thy hands ; 
Thou hast put all things under his foot : 

man's PLACE IN THE UNIVERSE 

Such is the tribute of the psalmist to the dignity, the nobility, the 
power, and the station of man in the universe. 

How came man to this glorious place of distinction and majesty 
among all God's creations ? The answer is in the delineation of his origin 
and history. Man, with Christ, was "also in the beginning with the 
Father." In his first estate, that is, before he came to this earth, his 
spirit was the literal child of God. "Before I formed thee in the belly, 
I knew thee," declared the Lord to the Prophet Jeremiah. And in his 
second estate, which is mortality, "God created man in his own image, 
in the image of God created he him, male and female, created he them." 
"And the Lord God created man of the dust of the ground and breathed 
into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul." Thus 
the eternal spirit of man became housed in a tabernacle of flesh in the 
likeness of the Father, and the sons of God began life upon the earth. 

They were not menial nor of low or servile nature. They were of 
high estate, of the noblest lineage, endowed with the God-given gift of 
intelligence or the light of truth, the sublime and supreme investiture of 
both God and man, the eternal verity which "was not created or made, 
neither indeed can be." This intelligence not only gave man superiority 
over all other creations but, even more importantly, it brought him con- 
sciousness of his relationship to God and the world and envisaged for him 
the purpose and destiny of his life. 

POWER OF CHOICE A GIFT FROM GOD 

With intelligence came a concomitant heritage equally essential to 
the eternal progress and development of man, — that of free agency, 
or the power of choice. For, "the Lord gave unto man that he should 
act for himself, wherefore men are free according to the flesh; * * * 
they are free to choose liberty and eternal life through the great media- 
tion of all men or to choose captivity and death according to the captivity 
and power of the devil." This power of choice is essential to our very 
existence for "it must needs be that the devil should tempt the children 
of men or they could not be agents unto themselves, for if they never 
should have bitter, they could not know the sweet." (Members of the 
Church will recognize these quotations.) 

This theological doctrine of free agency which has been proclaimed 



ELDER STEPHEN L RICHARDS 



39 



by our Church from its very beginning, this glorious concept of man's 
intelligence and his incomparable status in the universe, upon which more 
light and clearer explanation have come through the latter-day revelations 
of our Prophet than from any other source whatsoever, lie at the very 
foundation of, and indeed constitute the essence of the most discussed, the 
most contested, and the most priceless thing in the world today, — human 
liberty. It is as a premise to a few observations on this important subject 
that I have cited some of our doctrine. 

LIBERTY ESSENTIAL TO MAN 

Perhaps I should define liberty, but I do not propose to do so. I 
have heard many definitions but I need not choose among them. For 
our purposes here, everyone knows sufficiently well what liberty means. 
Every man senses it, which is infinitely more important than being able to 
formulate a definition. The more vital and less academic question is how 
to secure, defend, and preserve the liberty of mankind. 

Now I maintain, simple and naive as it may sound to some, that the 
first and prime necessity in the accomplishment of this all important 
task is a definite and conscious understanding of two things : First, what 
is this man for whom liberty is so essential ? — and second, what does one 
do with liberty when once acquired ? With reference to the first item I 
believe I have given a summary of our doctrine from which it may be 
logically deduced that man is vastly greater and more important than 
anything else in the universe ; that all other creations are designed pri- 
marily to serve his needs and purposes ; that all institutions, ecclesiastical, 
civic, and social are but adjuncts and contributory to his progress and 
welfare ; and that no government, no science, no art, no philosophy, and no 
order of society is greater than the intelligence and personality who 
invents, devises, executes, and maintains them. Even the Church, which 
is set up under decree of God, is not greater than man, for it is established 
merely to conserve the progress and welfare of man. 

OPINION OF A NOTED AUTHOR 

In this connection, I have read nothing more stimulating in a long 
time than Dr. Link's new book entitled, The Rediscovery of Man. I 
wish that everyone could read particularly the first chapter in which he 
decries that modern philosophy rampant throughout the world in the 
last several decades which has debased the noble concept of man as a 
son of God, the master of things and himself. 

He begins by pronouncing Harvard University's Tercentenary Con- 
ference of Arts and Sciences held in 1936 the greatest tragedy of the 
age. Here the outstanding scholars of the world in profound deliberation 
reached the conclusion that while science had made great contributions to 
man's physical progress, "the automobile, the x-ray, insulin, and thou- 
sands of other things, but that the social studies * * * had contributed 
little or nothing to man's understanding of himself," that the sciences 
"had given man a miraculous control over his physical environment" but 



40 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Thursday, April 6 First Day 

"they had added practically nothing to his control of his personal and 
social behavior," and that "individuals were more at war with them- 
selves, nations more liable to internal strife, and the world farther from 
international peace than before." "This," says Dr. Link, "was the gist 
of Harvard's celebration of its 300th year. * * * Add to this the fact 
that Harvard was founded, like most of our historically great universities, 
by the religious leaders of the time to prepare students 'for public 
employment both in church and in state' and the tragedy is complete. 
Three hundred years of science and education, of emancipation from 
religion, and to what end ?" 

He answers his own question : "to the end that the true values of 
personality and character have been almost completely buried ; that our 
educational system has become the most elaborate plan ever devised for 
obscuring the obvious and homely facts of life, to the end that we have 
created a complex system of ideas which, instead of helping mankind, 
threatens like a parasitic growth to kill the very civilization which it has 
produced." "A scientist like Alexis Carrell can write a book on Man, the 
Unknown — not because man is unknown, but because science has dis- 
membered him almost beyond recognition." 

Now my friends, these are the comments and conclusions of a 
scientist, a psychologist of great distinction with long years of training 
and a vast experience with individuals. Is it not time that there be 
reconstructed for the world the noble concept of man that makes him 
something more than a mere chemical automaton in a mechanistic uni- 
verse with a defeatist philosophy that robs him of the highest incentives, 
the finer virtues, and self-control? I believe with Dr. Link that it is 
high time, and I thank God that there is an institution in the earth pre- 
pared and ordained to do just that thing for humanity. Only when it is 
done will the first sure foundation for liberty be laid. 

FREE AGENCY EXERCISED THROUGH KNOWLEDGE 

What, I ask again, are we to do with our liberty when once 
acquired and how shall we preserve it ? Here, too, the answer comes from 
an adequate understanding of theological doctrines. Free agency is the 
inherent right of man. Through it he may exalt or condemn himself. 
He can exercise his power of choice intelligently and wisely only when he 
has knowledge of truth, because truth is the criterion by which his 
elections become good os bad, helpful or harmful to himself and his 
progress. 

What is truth? Here I must give you an inspired definition, a defi- 
nition that came from an unsophisticated boy-prophet, but one which 
rivals the definitions of the greatest scholars and of all time. "Truth," 
says Joseph Smith, "is the knowledge of things as they are and as they 
were, and as they are to come." How is such knowledge to be obtained? 
Through science and education ? Yes, in part, but not wholly. And why 
not completely? Because most of the knowledge of things "as they 
were" and things that "are to come" are without the realm and province 
of science, as well as much knowledge of "things as they are." Science, 



ELDER STEPHEN L RICHARDS 



41 



then, can give us but fragments of truth, not the whole truth. And the 
whole truth is necessary if we are to be provided with proper criteria 
by which to do our choosing. 

FAITH THE KEY TO KNOWLEDGE 

How, then, is the whole truth to be secured? The key is to be 
found in another revelation, "the spirit of truth is of God." That being 
so, we must, of necessity have God's aid in the acquisition of truth. 
His aid comes through faith and prayer. Faith contemplates the ac- 
ceptance of the spiritual reality of a world outside the domain of science. 
It involves methods and processes different from those of scientific re- 
search. It postulates humility and dependence on divine power, the an- 
tipathies of egotism and self-sufficiency. A contrite heart is the fertile 
field for planting the seeds of truth. In such a field they come to fruition 
in a knowledge, understanding, and conviction of the great concepts of 
life which defy the reason and philosophy of the arrogant, and self- 
sufficient, who will not stoop to the methods of the humble. 

TRUTH AND LIBERTY 

What, then, has truth to do with liberty? Jesus gave the answer 
when he said to his disciples, "and ye shall know the truth and the truth 
shall make you free." Free from what? Free from all unrighteousness 
and every sort of bondage that inhibits the growth and progress of the 
race. It requires but a moment's consideration for any sane, logical 
person to reach the conclusion that there is no freedom and no liberty 
worth striving for and preserving that does not contemplate the exercise 
of free agency in truth, in virtue, and in righteousness. Any other 
hypothesis would mean complete frustration and ruin. This is the second 
foundation for liberty. 

What then is the application of these doctrines to conditions in the 
world today ? I believe it to be this : that no nation under heaven can 
successfully preserve this great boon of liberty and freedom unless the 
people of that nation have a truthful conception of the status of man in 
the earth and also an adequate understanding of the exercise of the 
options and powers of free agency in conformity with the standards of 
righteousness. So surely as either of these concepts shall vanish, will 
bondage ensue. And this applies with equal force to the enlightened of 
the world as to those in darkness, as witness the countries of Europe 
today. Philosophies are more potent than armies in the progress of 
civilization. "As a man thinketh, so is he," and a nation is but an aggre- 
gation of men. Too often we think we think enmasse, — but we don't, — 
there is no mass mind/ — only that of the individual. That is why person- 
ality is so important to the happiness and peace of the world. You just 
have to make enough good men, and society and nations are good. 

TRUE LIBERTY AND INDIVIDUAL ACHIEVEMENT 

Now I scarcely need say that having great concepts in the abstract 
is sufficient. As a matter of fact, great concepts are really not acquired in 



42 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Thursday, April 6 First Day 

the abstract. True philosophy comes out of life and living, and truth 
becomes part of us only as it is incorporated in our habits. Individual 
strength to acquire the truth is what every man needs. No one can do 
it for another. It is so with liberty. We usually speak of it as a heritage 
from the fathers, — something handed down to us. It is more accurate 
to say that the opportunity to acquire liberty is passed on to us, for true 
liberty is a personal achievement, as I have tried to point out to you. 

I am sure that it is regrettable and a point of real hazard to individual 
liberty that in many countries, even to some extent in our own beloved 
America, there is a clearly discernible tendency to relieve people of 
responsibilities which they have long been accustomed to bear and to 
extend paternalistic solicitude and care to vast portions of the popula- 
tion. However well intentioned such policies, I am confident they are 
destined to result in weakening of moral fiber, increased dependencies, 
and, more importantly and worse than all, eventually, a destruction of 
the fundamental concepts and philosophies that have been responsible 
for the progress of humanity in the world. 

THE MISSION OF THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS 

What, then, shall we do about it ? I think our mission is clear. We 
are to go forth, not boastfully, but confidently, to deliver our message of 
truth to our f ellowmen. To give the message, we must live it and we must 
truly love those to whom we are sent. 

Let us never forget that we are disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ. 
He is our Leader and Exemplar. There must be no bitterness in our 
hearts and no harsh judgment for any of our Father's children. Mercy, 
kindness, tolerance, and love are the passwords that shall open our way 
into the hearts of men. Of this I am confident : if we love them enough, 
they will receive us. When they do and when we become qualified to 
deliver the truth in the spirit of Christ, then will peace and righteousness 
and liberty be secure. God grant this happy consummation, I humbly 
pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

An anthem, "O Morn of Beauty" (Sibelius) was sung by the 
Singing Mothers (Soloist, Mrs. Margaret Marchant). 

ELDER LeGRAND RICHARDS 

Presiding Bishop of the Church 

My brethren and sisters : For a number of years it has been my 
privilege to appear before you in these conference meetings as a mission 
president of the Church. In that assignment, and the fulfilment of the 
duties and obligations in connection therewith, I found exceeding great 
joy. I love the missionary work of the Church and the privilege it af- 
fords of bearing testimony of the restoration of the Gospel, and of the 
divine mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith, and the accomplishments 
of this great organization. 



ELDER LeGRAND RICHARDS 



43 



A year ago I was sustained as the Presiding Bishop of the Church ; 
and the duties and responsibilities of this office, during the past year, 
have also brought great joy to me and evidence that in every branch of 
the work the inspiration and revelation of the Lord are guiding and direct- 
ing the destinies of this Church. 

THE PRINCIPLE OF GIVING 

In this position my duties are more or less temporal, and I find 
satisfaction therein. I should like to call your attention to one principle 
the Latter-day Saints have learned to understand. They have learned 
to know the meaning of the word "give." We give of our time; we 
give of our talents; we give of our means. Our fathers and mothers 
give their boys and girls to the missionary service of the Church, and 
wives give their husbands. As I have often said in the mission field, 
if one is looking for an easy religion he had better not bother with 
Mormonism. Most of us know that we are at the call of the Church all 
the time. In fact, my wife has always said the children belong to her 
and I belong to the Church ; and I presume there are many brethren here, 
and sisters too, who feel the same way about it. 

We know the history of the Saints ; we know the great sacrifices 
that have been made. Those of us who have filled missions in foreign 
lands have seen the Saints leave all that was dear to them. We know the 
history of the pioneers as they left their homes behind and came to these 
valleys of the mountains. 

During the past year, traveling throughout the Church, my heart 
has been moved because of the faith of the Latter-day Saints. It seemed to 
make no difference whether they were to travel ten miles, a hundred miles, 
or two hundred miles, they were always there when the call came. They 
do not ask for compensation ; they do not ask for expense money. They 
know that they are to bear the burden of their missionary boys and girls, 
and the expense. They have learned how to give, and as I study the 
scriptures and read the words of the prophets and of the Master him- 
self, it seems to me that the one thing above all others in the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ is that men should be willing to give their all. 

THE GOSPEL REQUIRES SERVICE 

We are commanded to love God first above all other things, and our 
f ellowmen like unto ourselves. One good man who came to the Master 
said : "Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest." As though 
he would say to all coming generations : "If ye follow me, ye need expect 
no compensation," He replied : "Foxes have holes, and the birds of the 
air have nests, but the Son of Man hath not where to lay his head." 

And to another he said : "Follow me." But he said : "Lord, suffer 
me first to go and bury my father." There are very few obligations in 
life more important than burying one's father, but the Lord wanted to 
impress upon his servants the importance of a call from him, and so he 
said : "Let the dead bury their dead ; but go thou and preach the kingdom 
of God." 



44 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Thursday. April 6 First Oay 

And another said: "Lord, I will follow Thee, but let me first go 
bid them farewell, which are at home at my house." Jesus answered : 
"No man, having put his hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for the 
kingdom of God." He expects real service but offers no monetary com- 
pensation. 

Then he sent the Seventy out. He gave them nothing, but he gave 
them of his power, and said : "He that heareth you heareth me ; and he 
that despiseth you despiseth me." And they returned again with joy 
saying : "Lord, even the devils are subject unto us through thy name." 

Speaking again of service, he said : "He that loveth father or 
mother more than me is not worthy of me ; and he that loveth son or 
daughter more than me is not worthy of me. And he that taketh not 
his cross and f olloweth after me, is not worthy of me. He that findeth 
his life shall lose it ; and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it." 



MORE THAN SERVICE REQUIRED 

In addition to giving ourselves, and giving our services, the Lord 
has asked us to give of our means and our substance. We have men in 
the Church who give their time, they will go when they are asked to 
preach, they will perform a public duty, but it is hard to do the little duty 
that is seen in secret by them and God alone and their presiding officers. 
And so we are asked to contribute our tithes and offerings, not only be- 
cause the Church needs money to build itself, for before there was an 
organization of the Church, God introduced the principle of sacrifice in 
order that his servants and his children might be tested, that they should 
bring the best of their lands and of their herds ; and, because the Church 
did not need these things, and there were no poor to feed, they were 
burned upon the altar of sacrifice ; but the giving sanctified the souls of 
those who gave. 

The Lord apparently realized that some men can give service easier 
than money or goods. We have the lesson of the rich young man who 
came to the Master inquiring what he might do to inherit eternal life. He 
was told that he should "keep the commandments," to which he replied : 
"All these things I have kept from my youth up, what lack I yet ?" We are 
told in Mark's account: "Then Jesus beholding him loved him." He 
loved him for the good things he had done and sought to show him the 
way to perfection, so he answered : "If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell 
that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven ; 
and come and follow me." But the young man turned away sorrowful : 
"for he had great possessions." 

The prophet Malachi declared that in the last days the Lord should 
send his messenger to prepare the way before him, and he called upon 
Israel, and I interpret that to mean latter-day Israel, to return unto him 
and promised that he would return unto them, and they said : "Wherein 
shall we return unto Thee ?" And he said : "In your tithes and offerings, 
* * * * for ye have robbed me, even this whole nation. Bring ye all 
the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house." 

And I want to say to you, my brethren and sisters, that we need the 



ELDER LeGRAND RICHARDS 



45 



tithes of the Saints in order that the kingdom might go on, for it shall 
be builded just as rapidly as the faith of the Saints can build it, and it is 
retarded when there is a lack of faith. 

PROMISES OF THE LORD 

And so the Lord proceeded to promise those who would bring their 
tithes and their offerings together, that he would rebuke the devourer 
for their sakes, and that a book of remembrance should be written before 
him for them that feared the Lord, "And they shall be mine, saith the 
Lord of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels. * * * * then 
shall ye return and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between 
him that serveth God and him that serveth him not." 

Now) as a member of the Presiding Bishopric, I feel that the store- 
house of the Lord should be replenished. We have heard the report 
today. Much has been accomplished ; the faith of the Saints is not lacking, 
because our receipts have been equal to any year of the past ; but there 
are still many who lack the faith to do their part in rolling on the king- 
dom of God in the earth. 

EMPLOYMENT SHOULD BE PROVIDED 

In our office we contact many of our brethren who are out of em- 
ployment. Some of them are choice men of the Church, men who. have 
labored diligently and made great sacrifices, have sent their boys and girls 
on missions, and my soul has been moved with compassion. I believe if 
my greatest desire were fulfilled it would be that I could provide em- 
ployment for all these fine men who are worthy servants of God. We 
can help to feed and clothe them, and we will do that ; but we must also, 
as bishops and as quorum officers and ward work directors, put forth every 
effort to provide employment for them. In this connection, I thank the 
Lord for this great Welfare Program of the Church, which is assisting 
in such a marvelous manner. But I believe we should have a little more 
consideration as bishops and quorum officers to sit down with our brethren 
and study their needs and see if there is not enough genius in the leader- 
ship of the wards and stakes and priesthood quorums to be able to pro- 
vide activities for these fine men. 

Now, the Master tells us that when he shall come in his glory and 
all the holy angels with him, and before him shall be gathered all nations, 
that as the shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats he shall separate 
them one from another, and to them on his right hand he shall say : "Come, 
ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the 
foundation of the world. For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat ; 
I was thirsty and ye gave me drink ; I was a stranger and ye took me in ; 
naked and ye clothed me ; I was sick and ye visited me ; I was in prison and 
ye came unto me." 

Then shall the righteous answer him saying, "Lord, when saw we 
thee an hungred, and fed thee, or thirsty and gave thee drink? When 
saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in, or naked, and clothed thee ? Or 
when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee ?" 



46 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Thursday, April 6 First Day 

Then shall he say unto them : "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto 
one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me." 

In closing, may I say unto you, my brethren and sisters, that I think 
it is a grand and glorious thing that the Lord has re-established his Church, 
that so efficiently, and without cost of administration, is able to do so 
much to care for the unfortunate of its members. I feel that the bishops 
and the presidents of stakes and those who preside with them in the wards 
and stakes of Zion should realize the great responsibility that is theirs 
and should not regard it lightly, but should do all they can do to care for 
their brethren. 

God grant that his Spirit, and inspiration and revelation, may ever 
guide the destiny of this Church. Of all men who are examples to the 
Church in this spirit of giving is our worthy president. I remember, as 
many of you do, when he was sustained as the President of the Church, 
he said he would never ask any man to give more, in proportion to his 
ability to give, than he, or to be more faithful in observing the command- 
ments of the Lord than he ; and we all love him for his noble example. 

God bless the Latter-day Saints, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 



ELDER WILLIAM W. SEEGMILLER 

President of the Western States Mission 

My brethren and sisters, I am happy in having the privilege of rep- 
resenting the Western States Mission. In this mission we have over 
8,000 members, and 87 missionaries. Throughout the states where we 
labor people treat us with respect and consideration everywhere. 

In the membership of the Western States Mission we have those 
who are as capable, as worthy, and as faithful as there are in any of the 
wards of the Church where I have lived. 

I am happy today to know that from Denver 25 Singing Mothers 
are here. I am sure that the inspiration of these Singing Mothers is suffi- 
cient compensation to justify the presence of any of us. 

I was happy this morning when I heard the report read by President 
McKay and noticed that the Kanab Stake led the Church in paying fast 
offerings. I have spent most of my days in the Kanab Stake, and I feel 
a humble but justifiable pride in the fact that they demonstrate that they 
love their neighbor as themselves, for how does it help him who is hungry 
or cold to recognize his hunger and his need of clothing, without providing 
for him. So, to the Kanab Stake I want to say I was happy in hearing 
their record read. 

We have many fine opportunities in the Western States Mission, 
greater opportunities than were known when I first went to the mission 
field. We are provided with equipment that we little dreamed of when I 
was a boy in the mission field, and we are asked to give our program, 
"The Fulness of Time," everywhere. Radio stations are asking us to 
bring these records to them. People are asking us throughout the Western 



ELDER CARL F. EYRING

States Mission to give them opportunity to hear the history of the Church 
as recorded in "The Fulness of Time." 

Such a thing as this was not even dreamed of when I was a boy in 
Germany preaching the Gospel. 

The other day at Scottsbluff , Nebraska, a sectarian minister, in speak- 
ing to his congregation, said : "There is no church in this city that offers 
a program for the social entertainment and education of our youth ; and 
if ever a church does offer such a program, God will bless that church." 

Elder John O. Livesy, of Salt Lake City, wrote me a letter the next 
morning and said : "I am going to that minister tomorrow and tell him 
that we have a Mutual Improvement Association organized in this city 
for the very purpose he mentioned, and that we have eighty regular at- 
tendants, only eight of whom belong to our Church. And for this we 
shall call upon him for his benediction." 

My brethren and sisters, I know that the Gospel of Jesus Christ is 
true, and that every man and woman who lives it will be happy. I know, 
too, that there is happiness in living its principles, that the wages of sin is 
death, and that all who sin will be miserable and unhappy ; so I pray the 
Lord to give us strength in the Western States Mission to be true to the 
faith of our fathers, that we may be happy, for that is the purpose of our 
creation, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER CARL F. EYRING 

President of the Nezv England Mission 

This is precious time. I trust that I may bear my testimony that 
you may know that I believe in this Church and that I appreciate the 
heritage which I have received. 

I have enjoyed the music of this Conference. In the mission field 
we are delighted with the music which comes from this Square. The 
broadcasts from Temple Square help us in our missionary work. 

It is a pleasure to be at another General Conference. We of the 
missions, just as you of the wards and stakes, depend upon the inspirar 
tion of General Conference to motivate us to greater diligence as the 
disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ. As we worship together, we more 
fully sense the power we are, and the added power that we might be, 
as defenders of the way of life preached and exemplified by the Master. 
In the mission field, probably more than at home, we keep asking our- 
selves the question, "What unique message do we have for the world ?" 
This question becomes the more significant because so many well-in- 
formed and intelligent persons are free with the conclusion : All churches 
are good, select the one that suits your taste. Apparently the selection 
of churches takes too much of the same attitude to be found in the selec- 
tion of an automobile. Thus if we are to convert, we must not only pre- 
sent an acceptable religion, but we must develop first a conviction that 
it does matter which church is selected. 

What is our unique message to the world? First of all, we bear 
testimony that Jesus is the Christ- In no uncertain terms we declare 



48 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Thursday. April 6 First Day 

that the teachings of Jesus will save the world from slipping downward 
under the grip of materialistic and pagan philosophy. We testify that 
the way of life outlined by Jesus will preserve peace, and will eliminate 
poverty and suffering. We reaffirm that the attitude of "love thy neigh- 
bor as thyself," together with a practical application of this principle, 
will bring us out of our social and economic chaos. What the world 
needs is not more assent, or even belief that Jesus is the Christ, but a 
faith in him, a faith that will cause humanity to find the answers to its 
problems in the basic principles he taught and not in the teachings of 
self-appointed teachers who set up panaceas — short-cuts that lead down 
blind alleys. 

Further, we bear testimony that through a miraculous origin we 
bring to the world a Gospel restoration which is simply an additional 
testimony that Jesus is the Christ and that God really does care to have 
his children follow the way of life of his Son. 

The Christian world has accepted the Bible. Through this scripture 
Christians generally gain their testimony of Jesus, but through modern 
divine aid we extend to the world added testimony that Jesus is the 
Christ. In the preface of the Book of Mormon we read, "and also to 
the convincing of the Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ, the eternal 
God, manifesting himself to all nations." In brief, we notify the world 
that a people on this continent had unique religious experiences, similar 
to those received among the Hebrew prophets, and that the ancient 
American prophets testify that Jesus is the Christ. But we do more 
than present to the world this ancient scripture, the Book of Mormon. 
We present the teachings of modern prophets ; we present the vivid and 
convincing testimony given to us this morning by our beloved President, 
as he quoted from the Doctrine and Covenants (Sec. 76:22-24). We 
need the current testimonies of our leaders who are our contemporary 
prophets. 

Our greatest message to the world, then, is the declaration that 
Jesus is the Christ. We wish for all men that they might have faith in 
Jesus Christ. We claim that only through him and his teachings may 
the' inhabitants of the earth be saved from chaos. We further testify 
that through divine appointment and selection we have been charged to 
bear this testimony to the world and to live the Christian life so com- 
pletely that we shall truly be a light set upon a hill. This call of the 
Priesthood is truly a call to greater service, a call to the colors of im- 
proved and superior life. This is the type of testimony that we strive 
to bear to the world. 

I am very happy to report that your sons and daughters are main- 
taining and bearing this testimony. We are grateful to you, the fathers 
and mothers of these sons and daughters, for the support which you are 
giving the New England Mission. I can report progress, a fine condi- 
tion among our branches, greater interest in Mormonism, and a splendid 
development among your sons and daughters. 

God bless the leaders of this Church. We are back of them with 
our loyalty. We declare that this is the work of the Lord, and that Jesus 
is the Christ. Amen, 



ELDER DAVID A. SMITH

ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 

President of the Canadian Mission 

One hundred and three years ago a missionary representing the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints found in the city of To- 
ronto, Ontario Province, Canada, and converted and baptized a young 
lady. Soon after, she moved to the United States and married a man 
who had lost his wife. She became the mother of children the former 
wife had left. Later two were born to her. She saw and endured the 
trials and sufferings through the persecutions of Missouri and Illinois, 
where her husband was murdered by a mob. She was left alone to 
provide for and look after six young children. She made her way across 
the plains to the valleys of the mountains, not complaining, constantly 
teaching these children the word of the Lord as it had come to her from 
their father and his associates. She understood and believed the Gospel 
message, not doubting. 

I became acquainted with her only through the story and history 
of her life as it has come to me through her children. At first I saw in 
her life, suffering, hardships and trials, but recently I have found more 
than that. Possibly it is because the Gospel came to her in the city where 
I now make my home, but more assuredly because of the fact that this 
woman is my grandmother. 

Today her trials and the hardships she endured are dwarfed by 
her example of faith and integrity. I now see more clearly a spirit 
which overcame hardships and trials, and built up a resistance which 
enabled her to carry on and perform the labors which seemed necessary, 
not alone for her welfare and exaltation, but also to give encouragement 
and blessings to her offspring. Through my grandmother, I have been 
blessed and have found encouragement and strength, which has materi- 
ally helped me in the work I have been called to do. 

I rejoice in the opportunity I have of laboring with your sons and 
your daughters, some of whom come to us full of the spirit which comes 
from our heavenly Father, eager to go to work and prepare to engage 
in it. Some are fearful because they have been poorly trained. We 
must nurse them, and encourage them. They see that they are not 
prepared for this work and become discouraged. But as they apply 
themselves to study, and through prayer a new spirit comes to them, 
we find them gaining confidence in themselves as their knowledge 
increases, and the beauties of the Gospel message unfold to their un- 
derstanding. 

If you could have seen these young men and women during this 
winter, the severest winter with two exceptions since 1870, it would 
have made your hearts rejoice. We have removed from the walks in 
front of the Mission Home a little more than six feet of snow, and for 
months we have faced zero weather nearly every morning. Blizzards 
and snowstorms have been frequent, and yet our reports are almost equal 
to our summer reports, Some of the missionaries have been ill and have 



50 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Thursday, April 6 First Day 

gone to bed for a few days, but there has been no severe sickness. The 
Lord is good to us and we rejoice in the opportunities afforded us to 
serve in his great cause. 

May I suggest again, my brethren and sisters, as I have done for 
years past in the general conferences and in the stakes, that you take 
missionary work seriously. You do a grave injustice to your son or your 
daughter when you send them into the mission field to labor as mission- 
aries without that preparation which provides for them a foundation 
upon which they may build and go on with a feeling of security. I hope, 
as I have hoped for most of my life, that the time will come when we 
can develop here at home, the spirit which your boys and your girls 
develop when they are face to face with the problem of teaching the 
Gospel, which is given to us in its fulness in this the last dispensation 
— the dispensation of the fulness of times. 

During the last year the First Presidency were good enough to 
provide us with a chapel in Toronto. This year the few times I have 
been permitted to meet in that chapel on the Sabbath day— several times 
in a blizzard — I have seen men, women and children who have walked 
miles in zero weather and in a snow storm to go to Church, and the 
spiritual food they receive seems to justify and reward them. In the 
mission field we find faith which would do credit to any ward or stake. 
We say with the prophet of old : "Behold, my soul abhorreth sin, and 
my heart delighteth in righteousness; and I will praise the holy name 
of God." 

May he grant unto us that we shall not fail, but continue on under 
the influence of his Spirit and enjoy the blessings which come to those 
who serve him in faith, with a full desire to accomplish that which is 
required at our hands. With this feeling and this hope we are preaching 
the word of the Lord as it is found in the Holy Bible and the Book of 
Mormon and in the revealed word of the Lord given through modern 
prophets, the prophets of the latter days, and we are trying to follow 
these teachings and impart them to the people, many of whom find that 
they have lived in darkness and they rejoice when they see and com- 
prehend the light. 

May the Lord bless us. Remember us in your prayers. I am hoping 
the time will come when you will all have meeting houses built and paid 
for, for then perhaps, more money can go into the mission field to help 
build houses for those who cannot build for themselves and are without 
suitable homes where they may serve the Lord in general assemblies 
I hope to see this time come. May God help us to be worthy of such 
blessings, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 



ELDER WILLIAM T. TEW, IR.

ELDER WILLIAM T. TEW, JR. 

President of the East Central States Mission 

I am very happy, my brethren and sisters, to be here this afternoon, 
and to meet with you in General Conference on this memorable occasion. 
I read not long ago from the pen of one of our great American religious 
preachers that there "is no such thing upon the earth today as the true 
Church of Christ. I rejoice that a hundred and nine years ago in the 
little town of Fayette, Seneca County, New York, at the home of Peter 
Whitmer, Sr., the Prophet Joseph Smith, as the Lord's instrument 
upon this earth in this dispensation, organized the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints, and, according to the Lord's word in the 
preface of the Doctrine and Covenants, it is the only true and living 
church upon the face of the whole earth, with which the Lord is well 
pleased, speaking of the Church collectively and not individually. 

I rejoice in my membership in this great organization. I rejoice 
in my privilege of being in the mission field with my family, presiding 
over the East Central States Mission. I am happy to report to you parents 
who are here this afternoon, and to you parents who are perhaps listening 
in on this occasion, that during the past three months I have visited 
every district and almost every branch of the East Central States Mission. 
I have contacted your boys and your girls in their conference assemblies, 
and in their mission field experiences, and in the missionary testimony 
and report meetings. I rejoice in the growth and the development, and 
the spirit that accompanies those young men and young women as they 
bear testimony of the truth of the Gospel. 

During the last month, just previous to coming to this conference, 
I spent my time visiting five of our districts. Forty-one conference 
sessions were held ; two outstanding M. I. A. banquets were put on, and 
I believe that I can report safely and conscientiously that Mutual Im- 
provement work in the mission field is the key position that captures the 
interest, the attention, and the devotion of our young people, and makes 
of them real, genuine Latter-day Saints. 

In the East Central States Mission we have almost 14,000 members 
on our records. I regret to say, however, that we do not know exactly 
where a. great many of these members are; they have moved from place 
to place without leaving their new addresses. 

We also have in the mission field 106 Elders and lady missionaries 
today. We are bringing back, or have brought back during the month 
of March, 14 Elders and lady missionaries who have filled missions in 
the East Central States. 

We find in the East Central States a very great need of teaching 
the people the Gospel of Jesus Christ. So many of them have been 
converted through emotional appeal, which seems to be the method of 
procedure in a great many different denominations in the world. I read 
just a few days ago that one of our great American preachers defines 
religion as a great psychological experience. To me that is far from 



52 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Thursday, April 6 First Day 

the truth. Religion to me is the actual practising of the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ in our daily lives. It is a life process, my brethren and sisters, 
and it is my hope and prayer that through our efforts in the mission 
field we shall be able to encourage our missionaries along this line of 
activity, because we know that through their living the Gospel the people 
of the world have become friendly unto us. 

Very seldom do we hear anything derogatory concerning the Gospel 
of Jesus Christ as it is preached and lived by the Latter-day Saints. We 
are always met with a greeting that is fair and congenial, and really 
and truly tolerant by those with whom we associate. 

I should like to leave with you people one thought in closing. It 
comes from the great prophet Amos, of Old Testament days, that 
shepherd prophet who lived at the little town of Tekoa, near the Dead 
Sea. The prophets were the Lord's great trail builders, as they are 
today. They had the power and influence among the people to unify 
them, and set in order the Church of God. Amos was sent to the north- 
ern kingdom of Israel, in the days of wickedness, in the days of apostasy, 
in the days of indifference, in the days of Jeroboam II the king of Israel. 

One of the things he told those people is this : 

Thus he showed me: and, behold, the Lord stood upon a wall made 
by a plumbline, with a plumbline in his hand. 

And the Lord said unto me, Amos, what seeth thou? And I said, A 
plumbline. Then said the Lord, Behold, I will set a plumbline in the midst 
of my people Israel : I will not again pass by them any more. 

That plumbline, my brethren and sisters, to me is the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ. It is this living Church, which is the embodiment of the 
principles of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and I believe that we should 
remember that the eternal verities, those eternal laws of God must be 
lived up to if we ever expect to reap the blessing and the benefit that we 
should derive therefrom as members of the Church. 

May I encourage you to give us your faith and your prayers, and 
above all other things may we have your good works in living the Gospel 
here in the stakes and wards of Zion, that the reflection of these good 
works here at home may be a beacon light to us in the mission field in 
allaying prejudice, in bringing about a tolerant spirit among those with 
whom we labor. 

We assure you that with your faith and prayers and with our faith 
and prayers and efforts, and with the blessings of the Lord we shall 
succeed, and I may say, too, that, in the words of John Bright, the great 
English statesman, "If we cannot succeed as fast as we think we should 
succeed, we know that in the end our enemies cannot succeed at all." 

The Lord bless us, that we may succeed, and that we may succeed 
admirably, and as the Lord desires we should succeed in promulgating 
the Gospel to the world, is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 



ELDER ELI AS S. WOODRUFF 



53 



ELDER ELIAS S. WOODRUFF 

President of the Central States Mission 

It is a rare privilege that I now enjoy. I am grateful for my 
testimony that the Gospel is true, for the associations that are mine, both 
in the mission and at home, and for the blessings that are resting upon 
the Latter-day Saints. I think the Latter-day Saint people enjoy the 
blessings of the Lord so regularly that we come to accept them as a 
matter of course. 

I am quite sure we do not appreciate fully the privileges and 
blessings that are ours at the present time, nor the value of the heritage 
that has come to us from our parents. 

Shoemaking in America largely began in the New England states ; 
there were few good shoemakers elsewhere. When Missouri and the 
central west began to make shoes along the banks of the Mississippi 
and Missouri rivers, they imported their skilled workmen from the 
New England section of the country. A number of generations have 
passed since shoes began to be made at these points, and there has 
now grown up in that vicinity a generation of natural-born shoemakers. 
The boys and girls, as soon as they are able to be employed, go into the 
shoe factories and secure" employment. There seems to be a skill that 
is inherited from their fathers and perhaps their mothers — for women 
worked in the factories. Manufacturers no longer have to send away 
for their skilled labor. 

I have used this thought in connection with the Church. In the 
promotion of the magazines of the Church I have frequently said that 
there are no people in the world who can write such as our people can 
on religious subjects, or social topics, and that there are no magazines 
that equal the magazines of the Church. 

The very same thing is true with reference to the leadership of the 
Church. The Lord has said that we are to be like a little leaven that 
leaveneth the whole lump. I have observed that sometimes into a com- 
munity comes one man and his family who have this quality, and as a 
result of their coming, an organization is built around one or two families. 
Without them the organization could not succeed. If one of them 
should move away we would have difficulty in maintaining the little group. 

What shall we say then, with reference to the value of the teachings 
that come to us, and which we accept almost unconsciously, in the 
Sunday Schools and other organizations of the Church at home? 
Young men and women come into the mission field thinking that they 
are almost wholly unprepared. They do not realize the strength that is 
naturally within them, nor the rapidity with which they will obtain 
skill and arrive at a stage where they are able to leaven the whole lump 
and stir it up wherever they go. It soon becomes apparent that there 
is a leadership among them that is unusual. 

• There is another feature of our people that astonishes the world, 
and that is the cleanness of the lives of the missionaries. I had this 
brought forcibly to my attention through the sanitarium at Independence, 




GENERAL CONFERENCE 



First Day 



Missouri. We have a custom of bringing our "wounded" missionaries 
into that place. The doctor who attends them has marveled at the fine, 
clean bodies of the boys that have come to the hospital for operations, 
and the wonderful spirit of the girls that have gone there. The nurses 
at that sanitarium have mentioned it to the doctor, and he said to me 
one day : "Brother Woodruff, I know you will be very glad to hear this 
compliment to your people. Our nurses tell us that there are no people 
like yours that come within the walls of this institution, that there are 
none who respond so quickly to the healing care of medicine and good 
treatment, none who are so sweet-dispositioned to wait upon, and who 
leave behind them such a lovely and beautiful influence." 

This is the influence that comes from clean lives and from proper 
training at home. I am led to appreciate more and more the value of 
what the Church is doing. 

I know we are conscious of our failings ; I know we know that 
we have our limitations, but I say this if it is of any value, by way 
of encouragement to those who labor with the youth of Zion at home. 
People say to us : "Where in the world do you find such fine young men 
and such fine young women, so many of them ?" 

I always reply, "Why, the woods are full of them out west. All 
we have to do is reach out and take what we can use, and they are all 
good." 

Well, it is a marvelous work and a wonder, and the Lord is being 
magnified, and our testimonies are growing. The Church is growing in 
strength and power, and I pray that it may continue to do so, and that 
we may all partake of its blessings. I ask it in Jesus' name. Amen. 



I should like to repeat the request and the admonition made by 
President Grant this morning, that we exercise the greatest care in driving 
our automobiles. As he observed, there is a great tendency among 
us to feel that we must get to a certain place at a certain time. It is said 
that recently a Chinese, a man of great distinction, was to be taken 
uptown in New York by one of the Wall Street men of influence, and 
the Wall Street man described in detail how he would take the local to 
a certain station, that there he would take an express to another station, 
and that there he would get off and take another local and that by so 
doing, instead of taking a local all the way through, they would save 
a minute and a half. 

The Oriental said : "What will you do with the minute and a half 
when you have saved it ?"

Grant, who is listening in, that we have missed him, and that we join in 
prayers that he may be early restored to health and strength. 

I should like to thank, on behalf of the First Presidency, of this 
audience and of all who have listened in, the Singing Mothers for their 
excellent singing. 



An anthem, "The Lord's Prayer," (Cecil Gates) was sung by the 
Singing Mothers. 

Elder David R. Langlois, President of the Burley Stake, offered the 
closing prayer. 

Conference adjourned until Friday, April 7, 10 a. m. 

SECOND DAY 
MORNING MEETING 

Conference reconvened Friday morning, April 7, at 10 a. m. 

President Heber J. Grant was present and presided at this session. 

The music for this meeting was furnished by the Nebo Stake Choir, 
Elder J. D. Christensen, Director. 

The hymn, "How Firm a Foundation," was sung by the Choir and 
the congregation, after which Elder J. Robert Price, President of the 
Phoenix Stake, offered the opening prayer. 

An anthem, "He Is Risen," (Simper) was sung by the Nebo Stake 
Choir, (Melba Powell, soloist). 

ELDER REED SMOOT 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

I feel to thank my Heavenly Father for again having the privilege 
of attending a great Conference of this people. I know I utter the thoughts 
of everyone who listened to and attended the services yesterday, when I 
say that I have attended no Conference of the Church during all my ser- 
vice as an Apostle, or even before, when I have not felt in my heart that 
the thanks and the counsel and the wisdom expressed must have ascended 
to our Heavenly Father. 

Among the great things that every member of the Church should be 
not only interested in, but thankful for, is the privilege to serve God. 
I am thankful that I have been privileged to serve my God. I am grate- 
ful for the health and the strength and the vigor that enable me to be of 
service to my family, and with all my heart I am thankful for my service 
to my Church. Weak or small as that service may be I have asked my 
Heavenly Father to assist me in that service in every particular. 

A DAY OF EXTRAVAGANCE 

We are living in a day of extravagance and I have wondered of late 



56 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday. April 7 Second Day 

where it is going to end. The Church has set the example to every mem- 
ber of it and to the glorious nation that we love, to be out of debt. I re- 
member when our nation, at the close of the World War, found itself in 
debt to the amount of twenty-six billions of dollars. For ten years as 
Chairman of the Finance Committee, and a ranking member of the Ap- 
propriations Committee, I did everything in my power to reduce that 
obligation by necessary legislation. It was reduced to sixteen billion 
dollars and now it is up to forty billion dollars. 

I know it is easy to say "billions," and we have become used to it in 
America and perhaps in the world, but it may be of interest to some, at 
least, to give a description of what forty billion dollars really is so that all 
can understand it. I do it in this way : Supposing that the minute the 
Savior was born some person had decided to deposit in a place selected 
by him forty dollars and he continued that plan, carrying it out faithfully 
every minute to the present time, at the end, my brethren and sisters, 
there would be forty billions of dollars there. 

So you see what responsibilities rest upon those who direct the fin- 
ancial affairs of our Government. I want every Latter-day Saint, no 
matter where he is, to support in every way every recommendation made, 
not only by this administration but by the administrations to follow to 
reduce these obligations, for they will have to do everything in their 
power to accomplish this. 

I thank my Heavenly Father that the Church is out of debt. I am 
told by President Grant that it is ten years since the Church has been in 
debt. That is splendid. 

THE FAITH OF A PRESIDENT 

Among the homes that I visited during my service in the Senate of the 
United States was the home of President Coolidge, where I was invited 
several times. I never ate a mouthful of food at his home without a 
blessing upon it. Prayer was the practice of President Coolidge. The 
last time I visited him was shortly before his death. I sat by his bedside. 
We talked over conditions existing in our country, and when I was about 
to leave, the President said to me : "Senator, there is some plan in your 
Church, isn't there, where men administer to the sick and pray for them ?" 
I said, "Yes, Mr. President. We call that administering to the sick." 
He said, "Can anyone in the Church administer to anyone outside of the 
Church ?" I told him "Yes." He said, "Reed, I wish you would admin- 
ister to me." I did so, and I want to say to you, my brothers and sisters, 
I never felt happier in my life than when I laid my hands upon him and 
asked God to bless him. He was a wonderful man, as nearly all of the 
American people knew him to be. 

I believe, with all my soul, in the administration of the sick. I have 
seen the results of it hundreds and hundreds of times and it will never 
cease being a part of our faith. 

May God's blessings ever be with the Presidency of this Church and 
the Authorities of the Church. No matter what position they may hold 
may the Father give them a desire in their hearts to fill the position with 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 



57 



honor, with integrity and love. I am quite sure there is no people, other 
than the people of the Latter-day Saints, that has such faith in prayer 
and exercise it more generally than do we. Never forget God's blessings. 

THE DIVORCE EVIL 

One thing more that I desire to speak of is divorce. I haven't the 
figures now. I don't know how we stand along this line, compared with 
other parts of our country or the world, but I do know that the last in- 
vestigation made by me revealed the fact that there were fewer divorces 
per capita among the Mormon people than other group of people in the 
world. South Carolina has no divorce law and I understand Nevada has 
about fifty-seven kinds or fifty-seven reasons for a divorce. Brethren 
and sisters, I pray that the Spirit of God may be in your homes, and that 
marriage of a man and a woman may be such that they can work together 
in the service of our Heavenly Father and that the Spirit of the Lord 
may direct their thoughts and their actions, that people seeing their deeds 
may judge that there is something binding upon them and their conscience, 
quite different from those of the world. 

Our Heavenly Father, bless the Authorities of thy Church and par- 
ticularly give strength and health to our President. God be with us and 
bless us all, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

I realize keenly, brethren and sisters, the responsibility resting upon 
me in being asked to speak, being expected to lead this vast congregation 
in intelligent and profitable thought. I think it a wonderful accom- 
plishment for a man to be able to stand before a congregation of this 
size and think consecutively and intelligently, and to give intelligent 
expression to those thoughts. It makes me to fear and tremble. 

I realize in this position, as in all others, my dependence upon the 
Lord. If he were not to assist me by his Holy Spirit, my mind would 
close up like a clam. I wouldn't know where to begin, how to continue, 
or to end. But with the help of the Lord, the experiences I have had 
in the past, trusting in him and having his blessing to attend me, I 
have some hope, with the prayers and faith of the people, that I may 
be able to overcome my weakness and present something that will be 
worth our consideration. 

I have in mind that what I shall say will not only be heard by those 
within this building, a congregation made up of members and non- 
members of the Church, but possibly by many people on the outside 
who are listening in over the radio, and I would like to say something 
that would be helpful to those who are not members of the Church, as 
well as to members of the Church, if they will accept of what I have to 
say, the advice that I may be led to give. 



58 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday, April 7 Second Day 

I want to say this, that I am grateful that my feelings are in com- 
plete harmony with what has gone before in this conference. I think 
we have had a splendid conference. The Spirit of the Lord has been 
with us, and we have really been fed the bread of life. I was deeply 
interested in the statistics which were read to us yesterday morning, 
which show the accomplishments of the Church, and the faithfulness 
of the members thereof. I feel in my heart to bless the Latter-day 
Saints for their faithfulness and their worthiness. 



PLANS MADE IN COUNCILS OF HEAVEN 

And now I have a thought pertaining to the Gospel, that I would 
like to talk over with you and consider it together. We read in the 
Book of Moses, in the Pearl of Great Price, an account of a visitation 
of the Lord to his servant, the prophet Moses, where the Lord talked 
with Moses face to face, and in conversation told Moses that it was his 
work and his glory to bring to pass the immortality and the eternal 
life of man. 

The provisions for the accomplishment of these purposes were 
made in the councils of heaven before the world was. We were all 
present. We saw the Savior chosen and appointed, and the plan of 
salvation made, and we sanctioned it. Not all of our Father's spirit 
children sanctioned it, for we are told that one Lucifer, who stood high 
among the sons of God, took exception to the plan. He would substitute 
his will and his way of salvation for that of the Eternal Father, which 
would have deprived us of agency in this life, which we exercised in 
the spirit world, and other important principles were involved. Because 
he and those who were associated with him, one-third of heaven's hosts, 
could not have their own way, they rebelled and a war ensued, as we 
read in the scriptures, and he and his followers were cast out and down, 
and became the sons of . perdition. They were the enemies of God 
then, and the enemies of man, and they have been since, and they have 
wrought havoc among the children of men from that day to this. 

It is said that experience is a dear school, but that fools will learn 
in no other. I shall not undertake to say how much of truth there is 
in that saying, but it does have the effect of calling our attention to the 
fact that we should, as intelligent, wise men and women, profit by the 
experiences of others. And so we should profit by the experience of 
Lucifer and those who went away with him in rebellion, and forever 
and always try to make our minds and our wills conform to the mind 
and will of God, the Eternal Father, and his Son, Jesus Christ, who 
are one, and who seek our welfare, our happiness and our salvation. 

PUNISHMENT OF THOSE NOT VALIANT 

The negro is an unfortunate man. He has been given a black skin. 
But that is as nothing compared with that greater handicap that he is 
not permitted to receive the Priesthood and the ordinances of the temple, 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS

necessary to prepare men and women to enter into and enjoy a fulness 
of glory in the celestial kingdom. 

What is the reason for this condition, we ask, and I find it to my 
satisfaction to think that as spirit children of our Eternal Father they 
were not valiant in the fight. We are told that Michael and his angels 
fought, and we understand that we stood with Christ our Lord, on the 
platform, "Father, thy will be done, and the glory be thine forever." I 
cannot conceive our Father consigning his children to a condition such 
as that of the negro race, if they had been valiant in the spirit world in 
that war in heaven. Neither could they have been a part of those who 
rebelled and were cast down, for the latter had not the privilege of 
tabernacling in the flesh. Somewhere along the line were these spirits, 
indifferent perhaps, and possibly neutral in the war. We have no 
definite knowledge concerning this. But I learn this lesson from it, 
brethren and sisters, and I believe we all should, that it does not pay in 
religious matters, matters that pertain to our eternal salvation, to be 
indifferent, neutral, or lukewarm. The Lord, through one of his servants, 
addressing the angel of the church of the Laodiceans, said : 

I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot; I would thou 
wert cold or hot. 

So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will 
spue thee out of my mouth. 

To members of the Church I would ask, are any of us of that class 
today — lukewarm, indifferent and neutral — a lesson to be learned from 
the experiences of others who have gone before. I firmly believe that 
God had something to do with the recording of these events, and having 
them preserved and handed down to us from generation to generation, 
that we might read, and reading, profit thereby. We are under direct 
command of the Lord to search the scriptures, where these things are 
contained. We have been admonished in this conference so to do. 

CONSEQUENCES OF REJECTING THE GOSPEL 

We have another example, that of the antediluvians. We are told 
that Noah the prophet preached to that people a hundred and twenty 
years. They rejected the prophet. They rejected his message. They 
gave themselves up to the lusts of the flesh, and were immoral and 
corrupt, according to the scriptures. A just God, in his mercy, wiped 
them off the face of the earth with a flood. You may call that a severe 
penalty, but that does not tell the story, by any means, of the conse- 
quence of their rejecting of the Gospel and of their wickedness. We 
are told that they were shut up in a spirit prison for over twenty-three 
hundred years, according to Bible chronology. We do not know what 
the nature of that imprisonment was, but the prophet Alma tells us 
that they were in darkness and having a fearful, awful looking forward 
to the time when the fiery indignation of the wrath of God would be 
poured out upon them. It is something to be dreaded and to be feared. 




GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Second Day 



THE HOPE OF REWARD 



That suggests in my mind the teaching of the Savior. There are 
two principal incentives for all men to do what is right, the one the 
hope of reward, the other the fear of punishment. We have sung today, 
"How firm a foundation, ye saints of the Lord, is laid for your faith 
in his excellent word." And, "What more can he say than to you he 
hath said, you who unto Jesus for refuge have fled?" The hope of 
reward. He has promised the male membership of his Church who shall 
receive the Priesthood, that if we will magnify that Priesthood — and 
that means live righteous lives, lives of service to God and to our fellow 
men — all that he has shall be given unto us, and the earth is the Lord's, 
and the fulness thereof. 

There are other blessings besides those pertaining to earth and 
earth things. They are in the hands of God to give, and he is glad to 
give them to his faithful servants, his faithful children, for he loves 
us with a perfect love, and our souls are precious in his sight. 



So the condition of the antediluvians, of those who rebelled in the 
beginning, Lucifer and his followers, and the negro race that we have 
been speaking of, are object lessons from which we should profit. Not 
only did the antediluvians lose their lives in a flood — eight souls only 
saved — and suffered an imprisonment for centuries in the spirit, of 
whatever nature that might have been, but we are told in the vision 
from which President Grant quoted yesterday morning, that the Lord 
revealed to the Prophet Joseph and Sidney Rigdon the glories that 
we read of in the scriptures of the New Testament. The Apostle Paul 
speaks of the glory of which the sun is typical, another of which the 
moon is typical, and another of which the stars of heaven are typical. 

This was shown to the Prophet and Sidney Rigdon, and they were 
told what class of people should attain to the celestial glory, to the 
terrestrial and to the telestial glory. And speaking of those who should 
attain to the terrestrial glory, he said: "These are they who received 
not the testimony of Jesus in the flesh, but afterwards received it." So 
I conclude, and I think justly and rightly, that the antediluvians not 
only lost their lives, because of their wickedness and rejection of the 
Gospel, and were shut up in prison, but they are denied the opportunity 
of going into the celestial kingdom ; and even if they accepted the Gospel, 
or the testimony of Jesus, in the spirit, they may go only into the terres- 
trial kingdom. 

I am reminded of the march of time. We see over and over again 
that crime does not pay. And I say it does not pay to reject the counsels 
of God and give ourselves up to wickedness. There are the cities of 
the plains. The people, because of their wickedness in rejecting the 
Gospel — ten righteous men could not be found in all Sodom and Go- 
morrah — fire from heaven was sent down to destroy them, and may 



OBJECT LESSONS FROM THE PAST 



ELDER BRYANT S. HINCKLEY 



61 



we not conclude that their further fate was like that of the antediluvians? 
It does not pay. 

So we follow down six hundred years before the birth of the Savior, 
when Lehi preached the same Gospel to the people in Jerusalem, and 
his life was sought, that it might be taken away, as other prophets have 
lost their lives. He had to flee the city and was led, as you know, to 
this American continent. The people of Jerusalem who were not slain 
in battle were taken captive, and the city was destroyed, as Lehi had 
predicted, because the people would not repent. 

Then there are the sons of Lehi who were rebellious. You know 
the punishment that befell them. 

And when the Savior came, he came unto his own and his own 
received him not. They put him to death, and they have since been 
a hiss and a by-word in every nation of the earth, and the results of this 
action still follow them. 

Will we, brethren and sisters and friends, profit by the experiences 
and the mistakes of others, as we read of them in the holy scriptures? 
If we are wise we will do so. God grant that we may, for the salvation 
of our own souls, and the effect that it will have upon the world, I pray, 
in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.

ELDER BRYANT S. HINCKLEY 

President of the Northern States Mission 

It fills a missionary's heart with gratitude and stirs his soul with 
pride to attend a general conference of the Church. He may labor with 
ever so much zeal, still the returns are small. His voice is a little one in 
the world. You can well imagine how it heartens and encourages him to 
come to a conference like this and see this great body of people ! There 
is a serene and tranquil influence here ; a sense of peace and security born 
of a settled faith in God and his beneficence. 

I was greatly interested in the report which President McKay read 
yesterday, a brief and comprehensive report showing the great service 
of the Church, in a material way, for a single year; also showing the 
strength of the Church, its growth and its progress. 

Since listening to that report my mind has been going over the past. 
I am not an historian, but I travel over historic ground. I have been to 
Far West, frequently to Nauvoo and to Kirtland, and have passed over 
a good deal of territory which has been sanctified by the touch of men 
and women whose hearts were warmed with a living faith in God. 

A hundred years ago, an onlooker, unfamiliar with the spirit and 
power of Mormonism would have said that this Church could not endure. 
It seemed to be on the brink of ruin. The winter of 1838-39 was a very 
dark period. The leaders of the Church were imprisoned. The people 



62 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday. April 7 Second Day 

were scattered, pillaged, persecuted and pursued. They had no place to 
go. They could find neither rest nor security. Those were the days that 
tried men's souls. Many did not have the fortitude to endure, and fell by 
the wayside. Many were cut off from the Church for good reasons. 
Among these were two of the three witnesses for the Book of Mormon. 

I remember reading that when Brigham Young asked Bishop Part- 
ridge to care for the poor, that devoted and loyal man was so worn that 
he replied, "The poor will have to care for themselves." I only recite 
this to show that those days were hard even for the strongest. 

Out of those hard and bitter experiences, great things were born. 
Great leaders were brought to the front, men who, under the Almighty 
have led this people for almost a century. Those were the days when 
Brigham Young first gave evidence of his leadership and his resourceful- 
ness. It was then that he was trained for the great work which the 
Almighty had in store for him, for the hard and heroic days of 1845 and 
1846 and '47, and all the hard days that made up his great life. 

John Taylor, Wilford Woodruff, Brigham Young, Heber C. Kim- 
ball, Willard Richards, and many others were given the opportunity, not 
only to prove their loyalty to the Prophet, but to prove their fidelity to 
the truth. These men were tried in the crucible of affliction. Spurgeon 
once said : "The great soldiers of the Cross have been gathered from the 
highlands of adversity." It was true in those early days of our history. 
Those people were winnowed and sifted by the winds of adversity, until 
nothing but the wheat was left. 

They were the people who went to Nauvoo and with their bare 
hands built a magnificent city. They were the people who crossed the 
plains, and settled these valleys, and established their feet in these eternal 
hills. 

You remember that at this time the Governor of Missouri was 
enforcing his cruel exterminating edict. What became of the men who 
persecuted the Saints? Their names are forever forgotten, unless they 
are covered with infamy. And the great state that permitted this persecu- 
tion atoned for it in blood and tears in the tragic days of the Civil War. 
Running all through the history of this people is the sustaining evidence 
that the Almighty has directed their course. People recognize that we 
have something that no one else has. 

President Grant made reference yesterday to the 121st Section of 
the Doctrine and Covenants, explaining that it was given to the Prophet 
while he languished in Liberty Jail. I want to say, with him. that I have 
often thought that that revelation was the greatest declaration ever 
given concerning the government of men. Compulsion finds no place in 
the government of God. While Joseph Smith languished in that foul 
jail in 1839 the Almighty revealed to him the spirit and the genius of a 
government better than the world has yet seen. 

Compulsion cannot in the long run succeed. As Brother Geo. F. 
Richards has told us this morning, that principle was put on trial before 
the world was framed, or man appeared upon its surface, and those who 
espoused that cause, and all who followed them, were cast over the 



ELDER PRESTON NIBLEY

battlements of heaven and came upon the earth to rob men of their free 
agency, and to take from them the sacred privileges of personal liberty 
and freedom of soul. A great revelation ! 

My brethren and sisters, a missionary coming home has his soul 
stirred with two profound urges : First, to prophesy good for this people. 
That comes from a knowledge of their achievements, from the record 
which they have made, from the standards which they maintain, and from 
the ideals which they cherish. We are not better than the people of the 
world, but the Almighty has been exceedingly kind to us. He has tradi- 
tionated us in standards and ideals sure to bring us to recognition in the 
world, if we have the faith to live them. 

Now, the other urge : This is born of the zeal which a man develops 
when he preaches the Gospel in the world, that is to admonish his own 
people to live their religion. My brethren and sisters, it does not require 
a prophet to say that if we have the simple faith to live the religion which 
the Almighty has given to us, we are sure to find a high place in the world. 
There is nothing miraculous about it. It is a natural result of the religion 
which we have received. 

God bless you, my brethren and sisters. There is nothing that you 
can do to support the missionary work like living it at home, demonstrat- 
ing it in your own lives. God bless our President. It is a delight to hear 
the ring of his voice, its clearness, the precision with which he expresses 
himself, the benevolent influence which he radiates. This Church has had 
even seven presidents, but it has never had a better man preside over 
it than Heber J. Grant. President Grant is a demonstrator. He shows 
how it should be done. He leads out. I am sure the Almighty loves him 
and loves you. Peace be with you. 

The Northern States is a great mission. The good parents who are 
here this morning know that all is well with their children. If the mis- 
sionaries weren't happy and well you would be immediately advised. 

I know that Mormonism is true. I have always known it. This is 
my testimony to you : I never have seen an honest heart, that was warmed 
with the fire of the Holy Ghost, that hasn't been quickened to nobler and 
finer things. This is my testimony, and I bear it in the name of Jesus 
Christ, Amen. 

ELDER PRESTON NIBLEY 

President of the Northwestern States Mission 

Behold a great and marvelous work is about to come forth among the 
children of men. 

These words, uttered one hundred and ten years ago by a boy, poor, 
unlearned, alone, had little significance at the time. Today we may 
paraphrase these remarks and boldly exclaim: "Behold a great and 
marvelous work has come forth among the children of men." 

Brethren and sisters, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 
is very strong in the Northwestern states, where I am laboring as a 



64 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday. April 7 Second Day 

missionary. There is scarcely a town or a city of over five thousand 
population, in Oregon or Washington, northern Idaho or western Mon- 
tana, but that you will find a congregation of Latter-day Saints. I rejoice 
that our people are there, and in every way they are loyal and true to their 
Church. We missionaries could not begin to accomplish the work which 
is being done there without the fine cooperation which is given us by 
the Latter-day Saints who reside in our mission. 

I am pleased with the fact that many of our people are migrating to 
the Northwestern states. Our recommends show that about one hundred 
per month are coming into the Mission, and we would be pleased to have 
thousands more, if they could find opportunities there, and I am sure that 
the opportunities are numerous, both in business and in a farming way. 

In our gatherings together we find the loyalty of the Latter-day 
Saints, and it is not an uncommon occurrence to have people drive one 
hundred, one hundred fifty, or two hundred miles, to attend a meeting. 
Our Union meetings, which we hold monthly in our districts, are numer- 
ously attended by people who come from fifty to two hundred miles 
each way to attend their Union meetings. 

I rejoice in the young missionaries with whom I am permitted to 
labor, and if these young missionaries are an example of the young 
people in the Church, then I say, brethren and sisters, you need not 
have any fear for the future. All these young missionaries, when they 
come to us, soon obtain a testimony of the Gospel and bear it fearlessly, 
and they are loyal to the very heart to their religion and their Church, 
and they would die for it. Many examples come to us which are faith- 
inspiring. 

Not long ago a fine boy from Arizona — and Arizona sends us some 
splendid missionaries — wrote me to this effect : He said : "Father has 
gone broke. I am out of money." He didn't ask for money. He said : 
"What would you think if I got a job for a month or two?" 

I had to answer that letter, but I recalled, in reading Church history, 
that the Prophet Joseph, in fleeing from Kirtland to Missouri in 1838, had 
applied for a job cutting cord wood in Indiana. I recalled that the mis- 
sionaries who went to England in 1839 worked around New York City — 
Apostle Orson Pratt and George A. Smith and others — to obtain ship 
money to go to England. I recalled that President Joseph F. Smith, when 
he went as a boy to Hawaii, worked in the wheat fields around San 
Francisco to obtain his ship money. 

So I wrote back to this young man, and said : "All right. Get a 
job for a month, but take your companion with you." He wrote me in a 
few days that he was happy. He said : "I am milking thirteen cows night 
and morning, for $45.00 a month and my board. My companion is pitch- 
ing hay, and he is going to give me his check at the end of the month." 

At the end of the month he had $90.00, and the two started their 
missionary work again. He bought a new suit of clothes and continued 
his missionary work to a fine conclusion. 

There is loyalty, integrity and fidelity of the highest type in these 
young missionaries.

In closing I want to tell you that we feel the fine support that we 
have at home. We have absolute and perfect confidence in our President. 
We have absolute and perfect confidence in his counselors, and what 
they tell us we carry out to the letter. We have perfect confidence in the 
brethren who preside over us and who come to visit us. 

Brethren and sisters, I am an optimist. Things look good to me, for 
this Church in the Northwest. May God bless us, I ask, in the name 
of Jesus. Amen.

WARD CHOIRS ENCOURAGED 

I express, I am sure, your feelings when I say that we have been 
delighted with the excellent music that has been rendered during the 
sessions of this Conference. This Nebo Stake Choir is made up very 
largely of ward choirs of that stake. The Church Music Committee, 
with which I happen to be associated, is extremely anxious that we shall 
build up a choir in every ward. These can be combined for stake con- 
ference music, or even for our General Conference music, as we have had 
it here today. 

Tomorrow night in the Tabernacle we shall have a demonstration 
of what sixty ward choirs can do. Some fifteen hundred singers, who 
have been training now for several weeks under Brother Cornwall's 
direction and others associated with him, are going to show you what can 
be achieved by a group of ward choirs. We earnestly hope that all of you 
who are interested will come and get the inspiration of what I think will 
be the finest demonstration of a group of that size that has ever been pre- 
sented in this building. 

THE MISSION OF THE CHURCH 

The Church has a definite mission and responsibility, and how ex- 
cellent it is that we come together every six months, and in our stakes 
every three months, to keep our eyes upon that mission. Sometimes in 
my missionary work people have asked : "Why do you send missionaries 
to this town ? We are all Christians here. Why do you not go to the 
pagan nations?" 

Our mission is to every nation, kindred, tongue and people, no 
matter what their faith or nationality. Our mission is unique. We 
recognize no competitors, and yet we recognize men doing good in all 
churches, insomuch as they teach men to honor Christ, to believe in God 
and attempt to live up to some at least of the teachings of the Master. 

May I help you to keep this in mind by calling your attention to the 
ministry of the Master himself ? He undertook to teach men to step 
forward to a higher level. That beautiful Sermon on the Mount, how 
in contrast it was to the Mosaic Law that allowed an eye for an eye and

a tooth for a tooth ! There were not many who could endure Christ's 
teachings, however, and as they turned away from him he asked his 
disciples if they would go also, but they answered : "Whither shall we go ? 
Thou hast the words of eternal life." There was no other place. Diffi- 
cult as it was, they were determined to stay. 

REVELATION POINTS THE WAY TO LIFE ETERNAL 

Then one of the disciples said : "Lord, are there few that be saved ?" 
And he answered: "Strait is the gate and narrow is the way which 
leadeth unto life," — life in the presence of God, life in the celestial 
kingdom, life in the highest place provided for the sons and daughters 
of our Father, — "and few there be that find it." "For wide is the gate, 
and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction", — to death, meaning 
loss of that exaltation, — "and many there be which go in thereat." 

Our declaration to all men is that we know the strait gate and the 
narrow way, not from our knowledge, but from the revelations of God, 
from those who knew it, who have visited the earth and have revealed 
to man again in this age the way through that strait gate and narrow road, 
and the divine authority is restored to administer the sacred ordinances 
of the Gospel, to put men's feet in that path that shall lead to exaltation 
in the celestial kingdom. 

We have gathered together these hosts of people who have enlisted, 
and we are inviting men and women everywhere to enlist, to subscribe 
to the highest standards that men have ever undertaken to subscribe to 
in the history of the world. This people is peculiar because they have been 
able to reach a higher standard of living set forth by the Master. There 
isn't an item he gave to man that is not incorporated in this Church and 
in the revelations of God to this generation. 

HONESTY SHOULD CHARACTERIZE THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS 

What Peter" said to the baptized believers, that they should add to 
their faith virtue, and to virtue knowledge, and temperance and patience 
and godliness and brotherly kindness and charity, we have in the fourth 
section of the book of Doctrine and Covenants, and there is added, 
humility and diligence. 

The Prophet said in the Articles of Faith: "We believe in being 
honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing good to all men." 
I say these standards are the highest that have been undertaken to sub- 
scribe to by any generation. Our ceremonies and ordinances are im- 
portant, yes, but it is only the initiation. The great effort is to bring 
poor, weak human nature to adhere to these standards of living, to be 
honest with each other. One of the characteristics of this Church has 
been that we have the reputation of being honest. 

I shall never forget the thrill that came to me forty-three years ago 
when in the Northern States, at the close of an open-air meeting, an 
elderly gentleman with a high silk hat drove up in a carriage, and asked 
if he might speak. He said to the people of South Bend : 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 



67 



I want you to be kind to these Mormon Elders, because their people 
are my friends. I have been doing business with them for many years. I 
have never lost a dollar on a Mormon, and I cannot say that of any other 
community in the United States. I have discovered that a Mormon's 
word is as good as his bond. 

That was Mr. Studebaker, one of the members of that great institu- 
tion, Studebaker Brothers. 

I want the Latter-day Saints to know that our Father in heaven 
expects our reputation for honesty to be maintained in order that we 
may distinguish ourselves. Honesty to the Lord in the payment of our 
tithes and offerings is where honesty really begins. The record we 
heard yesterday thrilled us all because of the honesty and the integrity 
of many of our people. If we have failed there is always the chance to 
repent and get into the path again and undertake to conquer and to 
master and to overcome the weaknesses of the flesh. For there is power 
in this Gospel to enable the weakest of the weak to attain this perfect 
state of living. 

OBEDIENCE TO COMMANDMENTS BRINGS BLESSINGS 

So far as mortality is concerned we do not expect to reach perfection, 
but we can live up to these standards. There may be some of us who may 
feel like those of old : What profit is it that we pay our tithes and offer- 
ings ? We see the wicked flourish like a green bay tree. But the Lord 
comforted them with the assurance that not all of his blessings were 
material, that a faithful record of the acts and the labors of men was being 
kept, and added, "When I come to make up my jewels I will spare them, 
as a man spareth his own son that serveth him." Then shall the books 
be opened, and then shall we know, when we return to the earth, whether 
it has been profitable to serve God. For the man who pays his honest 
tithing is paying his rent to the Almighty, who is the proprietor of this 
earth, and if he expects an eternal inheritance upon it he must obey the 
law of inheritance. 

Has it been profitable to the Latter-day Saints that they have paid 
their tithes and offerings and sent their sons and daughters on missions ? 
The record shows that not only spiritual blessings but even material 
blessings have come and the windows of heaven have been opened and 
blessings have been poured out upon the heads of the Latter-day Saints. 

When we took our survey of the membership of the Church that was 
on relief it was not a surprise to me to find eighty-five percent of the 
entire group were non-tithe payers. The Lord had somehow or other 
taken care of those who had paid their tithing. There had been some 
who had felt that it was impossible for Latter-day Saints to pay their 
tithing, and then send their sons on missions and meet their other obli- 
gations. But our own survey reveals the fact that those who are meeting 
their obligations are tithe-payers, and those who are sending their sons 
on missions are tithe-payers, and they have not suffered financial loss 
because of these great contributions. 

I have before me a survey of twenty thousand living returned mis- 



68 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday, April 7 Second Day 

sionaries. What a glorious thing it is to discover some eighty-five per- 
cent of them are faithful in paying their tithing, and some eighty-seven 
percent of them have employment. The Lord has fulfilled his promise. 
I confess that a drain such as all this on any other people, without the 
favor and the blessing of the Almighty, would have bankrupted them, 
but it has not depleted us. And those who are most prosperous and who 
are blessed in their material affairs are those who have served the Lord 
in this respect. 

I once was asked by a banker if I thought the time would ever come 
when the treasures, such as gold and silver and securities, might be pre- 
served without putting them in banks and locking them up and then 
electrifying the vaults. "Yes," I said, "some day, not on this earth in its 
present condition, there shall be separated into their own group those men 
who are so honest that they could walk within hand's reach of that which 
is not theirs, and nothing prevent them, save the rectitude of their own 
intentions, from taking that which does not belong to them." And when 
they have subscribed to all the other requirements, they shall find them- 
selves in the celestial kingdom, whose streets will be paved with gold, 
and whose walls will be set with diamonds and jasper, and there will be 
no fear of these valuables being interfered with, for they will be honest 
who walk there. 

SOWING AND REAPING 

There are two principles as certain and as true as that the sun shines : 
Like has ever and shall ever be attracted to like ; and as we sow, so shall 
we reap. One poet has expressed it as follows : 

To every man there openeth a way and ways 

And the high soul climbs the high way, 

While the low soul gropes the low, 
And in between on the misty flats 

The rest drift to and fro. 

But to every man there openeth 

A high way and a low, 

And every soul decideth 

Which way his soul shall go. 

We are all free, but we are inviting every man to climb the high 
way. We know the way and that way will lead through the strait gate 
to the presence of God Almighty in the celestial kingdom. This is the 
mission of this Church. 

Yes, the men who are laboring to create faith in the hearts of the 
children of men in the Redeemer of the world are doing good, and we 
bless them for it, but they are not engaged in the kind of work we are 
engaged in. The masses of our Father's sons and daughters will find 
ultimately through their obedience, their salvation in some of our Father's 
other kingdoms. But that is not the work that we are concerned with. 

It is written in our own revelations that only those that can abide 
the celestial law can endure celestial glory. As we sow so shall we reap. 
We are reaping now, here on the earth. Blessed and fortunate are we, 
the sons of Joseph, the descendants of Israel, for we are reaping the con-

sequence of our righteousness before ever we lived on this earth. Just 
as Brother George F. Richards has indicated that our poor benighted 
negro brethren are suffering the consequence of their sowing at some 
other time and place, so as certainly shall we hereafter reap what we are 
sowing here and now. 

These are eternal principles. Every man and woman, no matter what 
their nationality may be, who can subscribe to these standards and add 
*to their faith virtue, keep themselves above temptation and full of the 
spirit of charity and self-mastery in that they can control their appetites 
and otherwise can subscribe to these highest standards of living given 
to us by the Master in preparation for eternal living in his presence, 
will pass to that company of glorified men and women, as certain as the 
sun shines. 

POWER IN THE CHURCH 

It is the mission of this Church to prepare men and women for eternal 
living in that glorified presence. And the power to do it is being seen on 
earth. There is more power in this Church today to control the world 
and its destinies than in all the armies and all the guns and all the mili- 
tary provision that is being made, for nations may be subdued by the might 
and power of arms only to rebel. There is only one way by which the 
nations can be brought into unity and into peace and into brotherhood. 
This is not through guns, nor might, nor force, but through the power 
of God and the love of our fellowmen that is in the hearts of this people. 
This great demonstration of bringing these hosts of people together from 
all nations, living here in love and brotherhood, is a demonstration the 
like of which has never been shown before in the history of the world. 

God bless the great and glorious cause of Zion, that we may keep 
our eye upon the great destiny of this work and its mission, for our re- 
demption, for our preparation for exaltation with the glorified and to be- 
come the hope, the light of the world, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

ELDER RICHARD L. EVANS 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

I am very deeply mindful of the responsibility of occupying this 
position. There are a thousand things I would like to say, but I would 
like the help of the Lord in enabling me to say one of them well. Ap- 
proximately ten years of more or less intensive activity in the radio field 
have taught me that the best way to say a thing in the fewest words and 
with the least time expended is to use a prepared script, but I have con- 
cluded, this morning, to speak without a manuscript before me. ■ 

INFLUENCES SURROUNDING GROWING CHILDREN 

A great many things of consequence to me have happened within 
the last few years, one of the most important of which is the privilege 



70 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday, April 7 Second Day 

I have had of becoming the father of two fine boys. One of them, with 
the liberal help of his parents, celebrated his first birthday anniversary 
recently, and the other is now just past four. Already, with a family 
yet so young, we are beginning to worry about those influences which 
come into their lives, and tend to shape their characters and their moral 
and spiritual integrity, outside of the family home and circle. 

We realize that in this day particularly, children partially leave the 
influence of their parents very young. From the time they begin to* 
toddle in the neighborhood they belong partly to some one else, and from 
the time they begin going to school, at five or six years of age, this is 
still more the case, and from then on until they go out to make their own 
way, they move farther and farther out of the realm of home influence. 

COMPARISON BETWEEN PRESENT AND FORMER CONDITIONS 

I find myself at times, because of this condition and because of the 
realization of it, with a certain envy in my heart for my grandparents — 
envy because of the moral and spiritual environment in which they were 
permitted to rear their children. They could go to sleep at night, in this 
community and in most of those communities from which we have 
gathered here, in the days of our more or less isolated condition, aware 
of the fact that the family home and fireside were the principal forma- 
tive elements in the lives of their children ; and if, perchance, their little 
brood was out at some place of entertainment, they could be assured 
that these places were being run by men whom they had put in office, or 
in whom they had confidence, and that they were as the extended in- 
fluence of the home, and were protected from moral tarnish or physical 
"harm. And if, perchance, there were a wolf at the door, at least it was 
the wolf of honest hunger, and not a wolf of warped thinking or subtle 
influence. 

I realize that the catalogue of the material advantages that we en- 
joy, that our grandparents did not enjoy, would number tens of thou- 
sands of items and services, and a listing of them would make a very 
thick publication, indeed ; but I realize, also that we have paid a price for 
each of them. 

The radio that carries my voice beyond the walls of this auditorium, 
the automobile that takes us to the world, and brings the world to us; 
that takes our produce to profitable markets, and that causes us to worry 
if our children happen to be out until one or two o'clock in the morning ; 
the airplane that brings us in touch with our friends and our business 
associates, almost hourly — or that drops bombs upon us under less favor- 
able conditions — and ten thousand other items that might be listed, for 
all of which we have paid a price. 

When I speak of envying my grandparents I realize that I would 
not go back to their day if I could, and that I could not if I would. They 
solved the problems of their day, and we must solve the problems of ours. 
Because it was necessary for us to do so, there was a time when we pulled 
up the roots that had grown deep into an older civilization, and planted 
them in a new place, but it is highly improbable that we shall ever again 
become an isolated people. 



ELDER RICHARD L. EVANS 



71 



It is possible, perchance, that we, or a part of us, could again find 
a place of isolation that would sustain and prosper an independent and 
an industrious people, but by doing so we would not be solving our prob- 
lems. We would only be postponing them, because the world is very 
small in this day, and civilization moves in very quickly. 

MOVEMENT AWAY FROM UTAH 

I am aware of the fact, further, that approximately forty-three 
thousand of our people left Utah during the decade between 1920 and 
1930 and that most of them were of such age as to be called youth. I 
am further aware that this movement is going on all around us, beyond 
the borders of Utah, and that it continues into the present decade, and 
shall continue. There are more influences, it seems, to take our children 
from us — more competition for the influence that we have with them. 
I think we should not discourage this movement that causes them to 
leave us. They go out for academic advantages, for better employment, 
and for various other reasons, and a man, after all, must go where he 
must go for the best good of all concerned. But those who go from us, 
and remain one of us and use their influence for good, are among the 
greatest assets we have, because around them grow up groups of our 
Church people, even so that it becomes necessary for us to establish our 
wards and stakes, from the East to the West in America, and beyond. 
Those who do not remain one of us fall away and become lost, and be- 
come something greatly less than an asset. 

HOME INFLUENCE FAR-REACHING 

And so I say I am worried about my young family, even now only 
one year old and four years old, and I hope that the influence in the home 
in which they are reared will cleave so closely to the principles of this 
people that when they go out, their internal strength will be greater than 
the outward stresses. I hope that we can, in all of our homes, cause this 
condition to be so, in the coming years, in the coming decades, and in all 
the oncoming generations, so that no matter where our young people go, 
or no matter under what influence they may find themselves, they will 
find that the fortitude- within is greater than the temptation without. We 
cannot go out with them. We cannot keep our arms around them, literal- 
ly. But we can give them all that a Latter-day Saint home can give them, 
and we must begin early. 

And so my plea this morning is to parents in general, and to young 
parents in particular, that our responsibilities may be realized and may 
begin in infancy, and may not cease until the grave, because our children 
are never too young to be influenced by our example, and never too old 
to pass from the realm of our influence. 

PROPHECIES SURE OF FULFILMENT 

I do not know in what condition this people will find itself a year 
or a decade or a generation hence. I do not know whether we shall be 



72 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday. April 7 Second Day 

at war or at peace, whether the world will be in greater spiritual dark- 
ness, or in a condition of greater spiritual enlightenment. I do not know 
what new scientific theories will prevail, or what new fads there will be 
in education, whether the press will praise or revile us, whether men 
will profess friendship or hate for us, whether we shall be in greater 
depression or in greater prosperity, whether we shall be materially 
better off or worse off — I do not know any of these things, but I do 
know that the words of all the prophets will be fulfilled, and that what 
the Lord has spoken he has spoken, and that though the heavens and 
the earth pass away, his words shall not pass away. And I know that my 
family and I will be better off to be found among the faithful of this 
people, than in any other condition in which we might find ourselves. I 
know also that this is true for my friends, and for all men everywhere, 
no matter under what flag they live, or in what land. 

A TESTIMONY 

I am grateful for the opportunity to serve. I thank the Lord for 
my knowledge of the divinity of this work, and I know, as well as 1 
know any of the facts of life, that Jesus was the Christ, the Son of God, 
and that the Father and the Son came to the boy Joseph Smith, and re- 
stored to earth the Gospel that had been lost. 

I ask the blessings of God on all men and on all of their righteous 
endeavors everywhere, and I do it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, 
Amen. 

ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

THE TABERNACLE A MONUMENT TO THE PIONEERS 

It was a very remarkable thing for the Latter-day Saints to con- 
struct this marvelous building, the Tabernacle, on the edge of the wild 
western wilderness in early days. The workmanship of this old building 
is very fine and everything in it bears the stamp of artistic design, ex- 
ecuted by hands who labored for the love of God. It was opened for 
worship in October, 1867, and it is one of the noblest monuments of our 
city. The proportions are good ; the effect is graceful and imposing ; the 
structure is in good taste, simple, and impressive. This Tabernacle in 
which we are assembled today is one of the great buildings of America. 
It was built on scientific principles and has been dedicated to God as a 
place of holy worship. The word "Tabernacle" is beautiful in its mean- 
ing. It is the place of the Holy Altar, where the people go up to hear 
the word of the Lord. Every time we come here, we dedicate this build- 
ing by our spirit of worship and adoration. 

As we sit here today under this marvelous dome, we may well praise 
the Lord for his goodness unto us. It is a holy shrine, a place of com- 
munal worship. If we are to enjoy and understand it, we must search 
for the thoughts and emotions, which testify alike to its beauty and to 



ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 



73 



ihe goodness of human life. We should know something about the 
thoughts and the faith of its builders as well as the craft with which the 
walls were built and the span was roofed. It is a house of God, for it 
shows how the chief manifestitations of religious feeling are connected 
with the idealism and the geographical influences of the surrounding 
country. We should know the human constants that entered into its 
creation : hunger and labor, seed-time and harvest, love and death, faith 
and hope. All these forces operated to create this Tabernacle, as well as 
our sacred Temples. 

In the days of the Emperor Akbar, there was written above the 
doors of the temple these words : 

O God, in every temple I see people who see thee, 
And in every language I hear, they praise thee. 

PRAISE FROM EMINENT PEOPLE 

It was Ruskin, the English art critic, who pointed out the truth that 
the basic principle of architecture is found in the capacity of matter to 
bear a weight and span a space. From this point of view, how glorious 
is this building ! Professor Thomas E. Talmadge of the American In- 
stitute of Architects says : "Up and down the Atlantic seaboard, through 
the Western Reserve, along the Gulf of Mexico, up the Mississippi, 
and over the plains, the Greek Revival spread. I have noticed that the 
famous tabernacle built in Salt Lake City by that extraordinary man, 
Brigham Young, has the tell-tale Greek profiles in its mouldings and 
cornices. In all these localities, climate, building materials, and even the 
habits of the people differ enormously. Yet the style of the architecture 
and even its forms are common to all." 

A few years ago, Dr. Wallace Clement Sabine of Harvard Uni- 
versity came to Salt Lake City with a letter of introduction from Dr. 
Edward Channing. The letter said in part: "Dr. Sabine would like to 
look over your great tabernacle. Kindly help him." I met Dr. Sabine 
and spent many days with him. The tabernacle intrigued him, he studied 
its contour and its acoustic properties. In this book, entitled Collected 
Papers on Acoustics, Dr. Sabine says: 

I know of no building a considerable portion of whose wall or ceiling- 
surface is part of an exact ellipsoid of revolution, but the great Mormon 
Tabernacle in Salt Lake City is a near approximation. Plans of this re- 
markable building do not exist, for it was laid out on the ground without 
the aid of formal drawings soon after the settlers had completed their weary 
pilgrimage across the Utah desert and settled in their isolated valley 
It was built without nails, which were not to be had, and held together 
merely by wooden pins and tied with strips of buffalo hide. Notwithstand- 
ing this construction, and notwithstanding the fact that it spans 250 feet 
in length, and ISO feet in breadth, and is without any interior columns of 
any sort, it has been free from the necessity of essential repair for over 
fifty years. As the photograph shows, taken at the time of building, the 
space between the ceiling and the roof is a wooden bridge truss construction. 
These photographs, given by the elders of the church, are themselves inter- 
esting considering the circumstances under which they were taken, the 
early date and the remote location. 

It is difficult for an interior photograph of a smooth ceiling to give an 



74 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday. April 7 Second Day 

impression of its shape. An idea of the shape of the interior of the Taber- 
nacle may be obtained, however, from a photograph of its exterior. It ob- 
viously somewhat resembles an ellipsoid of revolution. It is equally obvious 
that it is not exactly that. Nevertheless there are two points between which 
faint sounds are carried with remarkable distinctness — the reader's desk 
and the front of the balcony in the rear. 

The essential geometrical property of an ellipsoid of revolution is that 
lines drawn to any point of the surface from the two foci make equal angles 
with the surface. It follows that sound diverging from one focus will be 
reflected toward the other. The preceding photographs show the progress 
of a sound-wave in the model of an idealized whispering gallery of this 
type in which the reflecting surface is a portion of a true ellipsoid of revo- 
lution. 

PLACES IN WHICH TO WORSHIP THE LORD 

As you sit here this morning and cast your eyes to the ceiling you 
will feel the majesty of its creation. Right that you should. Before it 
was built it was worked out in the mind of a great architect whose name 
was Henry Grow. The style of the building was happily chosen, and 
though I am told that it violates some architectural conventions, it has a 
large note of originality that is very conspicuous. It is a realized dream, 
and it was wrought out by hard labor and sublime faith. It has a spiritual 
quality that puts us all in a proper frame of mind to receive the word 
of God. The great men who built it demonstrated that their talents were 
equal to their tasks. 

So may we also speak of our meeting houses in every stake of Zion. 
They are small tabernacles, where the Saints go up to hear the word of 
God, and to partake of the holy sacrament. We can make of our sacra- 
ment meeting something more sacred and divine. Every Sabbath even- 
ing we should go to these holy houses, with the spirit of worship. There 
should be no whispering, no noise, no feeling of hate or envy in the soul 
of any one who sits within the sacred presence of the Lord. 

You do sit in the sacred presence of the Lord when you are as- 
sembled in one of these holy houses, for a prayer has dedicated the 
meeting to God. "We take upon ourselves his holy name." 

If you will turn to the first Book of Kings, you will find the prayer 
that was recited by the people who went into Solomon's temple. It is 
in the 8th chapter, 28 and 29 verses, and reads : 

Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his 
supplication, O Lord my God, to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer 
which thy servant prayeth before thee today. 

That thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day, even 
toward the place of which thou hast said, My name shall be there: that 
thou mayest hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall make toward 
this place. 

TRIBUTE TO EARLY BUILDERS 

The design of the building was suggested by President Brigham 
Young, and it was planned by Henry Grow. The largest hall in the 
world unsupported by columns, it was built after the Remington Patent 
of Lattice bridges, in which construction Mr. Grow was a master. The 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



building of the stone pillars was supervised by another master builder, 
William B. Folsom. It is my joy to pay tribute to these two brethren, 
as well as to Truman O. Angell, whose genius was expressed in the 
building of the Temple. In fact there were many fine architects and 
builders in the early days of this State, men who gave their lives to help 
build the cities and meeting houses and who had ever before them the 
establishment of the kingdom of God in the world. 

NEED FOR WORSHIP 

This great building has a beauty of holiness; and all our meeting 
houses should have the same beauty, for they are dedicated for holy 
worship. Their charm must be in the thousands of happy people, both 
old and young, who give thanks to God for the opportunity of living 
life, and for the light that has come into the world to guide us to the 
kingdom. The need of the world today is the worship of God by every 
living soul. In worship, hate, unkindness and war come to an end, for 
where the love of mankind is, there is God. If we all lived according to 
the light, our homes would be places of worship, and God would have 
an altar in every dwelling. Our meeting houses would also be shrines 
where our faith would be met by the Spirit of God. 

May we not every Sabbath day say : "Come, let us go up unto the 
temple to worship him, to show our adoration of him who gives us the 
way to attain eternal life." May the blessing of God attend us one and 
all when we are assembled in this beautiful house of the Lord. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

We are very grateful to the Nebo Stake Choir and thank them for 
their fine music upon this occasion. 

We were also delighted with the singing of the Singing Mothers 
yesterday, and we thank them for their fine work. 



An anthem, "Cherubim," (Bortniansky) was sung by the Nebo 
Stake Choir. 

Elder Wilf ord A. Beesley, President of the Salt Lake Stake, offered 
the benediction. 

Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



SECOND DAY 
AFTERNOON MEETING 

Conference reconvened at 2 p. m., Friday, April 7. 

President David O. McKay, Second Counselor in the First Presi- 
dency, conducted this, the fourth session of the Conference, and an- 
nounced that the music for this session would be furnished by the 
Nebo Stake Choir, J. D. Christensen, Director. 

The Choir and congregation joined in singing the hymn, "Do What 
Is Right." 

Elder John C. Todd, President of the Gridley Stake offered the 
opening prayer. 

PRESIDENT DAVID O. McKAY 

Second Counselor in the First Presidency 

President Grant was advised to conserve his strength this afternoon, 
and so he is following the advice of his physician. There is nothing 
serious, however, nothing about which to be alarmed. He is listening 
in to the services and is with us in spirit. 



The Nebo Stake Choir sang "Recessional" (DieKoven), Irene 
Provostgaurd, soloist. 

ELDER JOSEPH L. WIRTHLIN 

Second Counselor in the Presiding Bishopric 

I sincerely trust, my brethren and sisters, that I may have an 
interest in your faith and prayers during the moment or two that I shall 
stand before you this day. 

AN EXPRESSION OF GRATITUDE 

I am gratified to know that the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, 
as it has been revealed through the Prophet Joseph Smith, is true. I 
am grateful for my membership in this Church. I am particularly 
grateful, my brethren and sisters, for the opportunity that has been 
afforded me in visiting some of the stakes of Zion this past year, and 
in becoming acquainted with you. 

I have nothing in my heart but gratitude and appreciation for the 
association that is mine with the leadership of this Church. I have 
found these men to be inspired leaders of the Lord, with but one desire 
in their hearts, and that to diligently labor for the benefit and the welfare 
of the membership of this great Church. 



ELDER JOSEPH L. WIRTHLIN 



77 



To me, the Church has two objectives. The first one is to preach 
the Gospel of Jesus Christ to every nation, kindred, tongue and people. 
That has been and is being accomplished through the efforts of the 
young men and women who are representing the Church in the world 
today, under the inspired leadership of the mission presidents. 

THE VALUE OF COUNSEL 

The next objective, as I understand it, is that one which has to do 
with the entire membership of the Church, to see that they are counseled, 
advised, exhorted, and stimulated to the utmost to observe all that the 
Lord requires of his people. 

A statement of one of the' ancients impresses upon us the value of 
counsel, "Where no counsel is, the people fall; but in the multitude of 
counselors there is safety." In the restoration of the Church organiza- 
tion the Lord placed in it offices and officers for the purpose of coun- 
seling the people, that they might live and be in safety. The first great 
counselor to the people is the President of the Church, a prophet, an 
apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ, with the right to counsel and advise 
the people in all things, be they temporal or spiritual. 

We accept the President of the Church as a prophet of the Lord. 
The Lord reveals to him his mind and will, as it pertains to' us. Amos 
of old said, "Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his 
secret unto his servants the prophets." And we have a prophet in our 
midst, through whom the Lord makes known his mind and will. 

The President of the Church and the prophet of the Lord holds 
another prerogative, another right, by virtue of his calling, which none 
of us should ever question, the right to raise a voice of warning when 
any issue arises that endangers the moral, temporal, or spiritual welfare 
of the people. 

The two counselors of the President have the right to counsel, 
advise, and exhort us. The Council of the Twelve are sent to the stakes 
periodically to advise and counsel the people, and to build up the King- 
dom. We have the First Council of the Seventy, Stake Presidents, and 
Bishops, sharing the responsibility of teaching the people. There is 
also another great group of counselors to the people. This group of 
counselors is found in every ward. They may number from forty to 
probably one hundred and twenty-five. We call them Teachers, men 
endowed with the Priesthood sent out to counsel and teach the people 
at least once a month. 

In the twentieth section of the Doctrine and Covenants, the fiftieth 
to fifty-fifth verses, we read : 

But when there is an elder present, he is only to preach, teach, expound, 
exhort, and baptize, 

And visit the house of each member, exhorting them to pray vocally 

and in secret and attend to all family duties. 

***** 



78 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday. April 7 Second Day 

The teacher's duty is to watch over the Church always, and be with 
them and strengthen them; 

And see that there is no iniquity in the Church, neither hardness with 
each other, neither lying, backbiting, nor evil speaking. 

And see that the Church meet together often, and also see that all 
members do their duty. 

THE DUTY OF TEACHERS 

These are the Teachers that have the direct contact with each and 
every family in the Church. These Teachers have definite responsibilities, 
and I should like to point out several of them. First, a Teacher should 
lead an exemplary life. Secondly, he should be prepared and understand 
the Gospel of Jesus Christ. He should approach his work with a 
prayerful attitude. He should visit regularly, and preclude all material 
and conversation that does not pertain to the monthly message. And 
finally, to follow the admonition as given to us in the revelation, to watch 
over the Church always, to be with and strengthen them, not only in 
times of prosperity, but in times of death, sickness, economic stress, and 
particularly where there are cases of inactivity in the ward. 

There is no greater assignment to the Priesthood than watching 
over the Church. The missionary objective of the Church is a great one. 
It brings members into the Church. But this assignment of watching 
over the Church is just as important. It has its place, for with this 
assignment we keep those who come into the Church, active, interested 
and stimulated. 

Those of us who are taught by these Teachers have some responsi- 
bilities. When these Teachers visit our homes they should be received as 
representatives either of the Presidency of the Church, the stake presi- 
dency, or the bishop of the ward. They should be regarded as servants 
of the Lord, receiving every courtesy. The evening paper should be laid 
aside, the radio turned off, the family called together, and the leading 
of the discussion turned over to the Teachers. 

The Teachers have another obligation. It is their duty not only 
to call upon these families once a month, but to visit them often. They 
should think of them in terms of being shepherds of the flock. The 
greatest example of a real shepherd is found in the case of the Lord 
Jesus, when he instructed Peter to "feed my sheep and feed my lambs," 
and then told the beautiful story of the shepherd who had lost one of 
the fold, and leaving the other ninety-nine who were secure in the fold, 
hastened into the desert to rescue the lost one. The duty of the Teachers 
of the Church should always be to rescue the lost ones, bringing them 
back into the fold. 

There isn't a parent who does not have the heartfelt desire of having 
his son or daughter understand the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Complaints 
are often heard about our young people attending institutions of learn- 
ing, and coming in contact with the theories of men, which have dis- 
rupted their faith in and attitude toward religion. If we take advantage, 
brethren and sisters, of these 'visits, permitting our boys and girls to 



ELDER JOSEPH L. WIRTHLIN 



79 



participate in the discussion, thus receiving an understanding of the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ, they will be fortified, when attending other insti- 
tutions, against the doctrines of men. 

There isn't an individual in this Church, who has the interest of 
the youth at heart, but who would be thrilled to have his boy or his 
girl stand up and say, as Ruth of old said to her companion: "Your 
people shall be my people, and your God my God." In teaching the 
people, it should be one of our objectives to touch the hearts of the youth. 

This teaching and counseling is in full accord with the first organi- 
zation of the Church. We find that the Apostle Paul, in speaking to the 
Ephesian Saints, said : 

And he gave some, apostles ; and some, prophets ; and some, evan- 
gelists ; and some, pastors, and teachers ; 

For the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the ministry, for the 
edifying of the body of Christ ; 

Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of 
the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of 
the fulness of Christ. 

In this day of the restored Church of the Lord Jesus Christ, he has 
again set some apostles and prophets and evangelists and pastors and 
teachers for the purpose of counseling the people, perfecting the Saints, 
until we all come to a knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ and his 
purposes, and a unity of the faith. 

If we fulfil the obligation that rests upon us, we will consider this 
matter of teaching the people as the highest and the most important 
calling that can come to us in the stakes and the wards of Zion. 

THE CHURCH TO BE A STANDARD TO THE WORLD 

The Lord has given us a definite mission to fulfil to the world. 
This Church and people are to become a light unto the world, a beacon 
on a hill, for he said to us, in the 115 Section of the Doctrine and Cove- 
nants, verse 5 : 

Verily I say unto you all : Arise and shine forth, that thy light may 
be a standard for the nations. 

The light of this Church will be a standard to the world, insofar 
as we strengthen its membership, individually and collectively. 

I sincerely pray that the Lord will bless us that we may have in 
our hearts always a burning testimony of the divine origin of this great 
organization and its purposes, that when the day comes to stand before 
the nations we shall be prepared to stand as a source of truth, inspiration, 
and good works, which I pray will be the achievement of all of us, in the 
name of Jesus Christ- Amen,

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Second Day 



ELDER JOHN H. TAYLOR 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

Notwithstanding, my brothers and sisters, the timid feeling that is in 
my soul, I am very happy to be called upon to speak this afternoon. 

OPPORTUNITIES GIVEN THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS 

When I see the large congregation of men and women that we have 
today, and the large congregation of women that we had the other day 
when this Tabernacle was filled with Relief Society workers, and when 
I see the great number of members of the Priesthood who gather in this 
building, and know of the large attendance of members of the Church 
that we have in our ward and stake conferences and our auxiliary meet- 
ings, it impresses me with the fact we, as a people, are surely blessed 
in the opportunities that are given to us for religious training and develop- 
ment. This opportunity that we have of being members of the Church, 
and participating in the activities of the Church, surely trains us in 
leadership, and trains us to be intelligent followers. 

We are a church of office holders. The majority of us have been 
leaders in the Church, are leaders, or some day will be. Paradoxically, 
we are all followers, and none of us is exempt from the directing influ- 
ence of other men and women who may have been appointed to preside 
over us. The privilege of presiding gives us training in leadership and 
executive ability. To be a follower trains us in humility and appreciation 
of our brothers and sisters in the Church, and helps us to be sympathetic, 
kind and tolerant towards each other. 

Perhaps these blessings have come to us because of the type of or- 
ganization which we have in the Church. We are divided into stakes 
and wards and missions and branches. Being in small units we are able 
to know each other personally and to be helpful to each other in time of 
need. This type of organization gives us the same advantages in the 
Church units as the family gives the father and mother and the boys and 
girls in the family unit. 

Then, again, we have the auxiliaries, in which we have another op- 
portunity to teach or to be taught, to be a leader or to be a follower. The 
objectives of these auxiliary organizations are to train us in the things 
of God, to help us to have faith in the revealed word of our Heavenly 
Father, to acquaint us with the cultural things of life, and to give us an 
opportunity of participating in different types of activity that mean 
development and progress. 

PRIESTHOOD INTENDED FOR SERVICE 

Perhaps our greatest blessing is the Priesthood. Most of the male 
members of the Church have the opportunity of holding the Priesthood 
of the Lord, functioning in the activities of the Priesthood, and perform- 
ing duties and obligations that bring happiness and comfort and consola- 



ELDER JOHN H. TAYLOR 



81 



tion to the members of the Church. All of these things are an advantage 
to us in our progress and development, but they are of no value unless 
we use them as they should be used. We are given the Priesthood so 
that we might act in the name of the Lord, and perform services for him 
to benefit and help our brothers and sisters in the Church. If we are 
only going to hold the Priesthood because it is offered to us, or because 
we have arrived at a certain age, I am sure that it is not very valuable to us. 

I am convinced that the Lord did not intend that we should have 
the Priesthood just to hold, but that he expects us to function honor- 
ably and progressively in this Priesthood. There seems to be no justice 
in ordaining a boy who is a Priest, to the office of an Elder if he hasn't 
functioned as a Priest, or shown any desire to do the things that might 
have been assigned to him. 

There is no particular use of having our auxiliary organizations 
unless we go to them, unless they are carried on in the best possible way, 
and unless in them we are taught correct doctrine. It seems to me that 
the Church shouldn't have to be worrying about the correctness of doc- 
trines being taught in our auxiliary organizations. The type of men and 
women selected for teachers and the care given the preparation of study 
courses should prove ample safeguard. 

"harmonizers" 

Recently I have been talking to some individuals about science and 
religion. Some of them are teachers in our auxiliaries and other Church 
institutions. Because of their attitude and their frequent reference to 
the word "harmonize" I have, for my own convenience, called them 
"harmonizers." As near as I can find out, a harmonizer in the Church 
is one who can take the doctrines and revealed word of the Lord and 
adroitly, by some whittling or some minor operation, if necessary, fit them 
into the scientific and intellectual puzzles of the day, without any apparent 
harm, (from his point of view) to the doctrine of the Church, or to the 
puzzle, or to the student. 

MANY BLESSINGS 

It seems to me, brethren and sisters, that when we have all of these 
advantages in the way of small units where we are kept closely together 
in the auxiliaries that perform a certain important and vital part of the 
Lord's work, and when we have the Priesthood which brings happiness 
and comfort, that we are indeed a blessed people and we should be, as 
undoubtedly we are, very grateful unto our Heavenly Father for all 
these blessings. 

I trust, brethren and sisters, that as Latter-day Saints we will take 
advantage of the opportunities that are available to us so that the Lord 
will be more pleased with us than he may be at the present time, and that 
because of the righteousness of our lives we may receive greater blessings 
and be more worthy of a place in his kingdom. This I humbly pray in 
Jesus' name. Amen. 



82 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday, April 7 % Second Day 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 

Associate to the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

I deem it a privilege, my brethren and sisters, to be with you in this 
great conference, and partake of the spirit that has been manifest in all 
the meetings thus far. I rejoice in the wonderful spirit of testimony and 
instruction that have been given to us. I have been delighted with the 
beautiful music that has been rendered. I have been greatly impressed 
with the song that was sung this afternoon, that we should still appreciate 
the sacrifice established of the Lord, that we should have a broken heart 
and a contrite spirit, love him and serve him, and not forget the cove- 
nants we have made with him. 

It is a pleasure to hear our President bear the splendid testimony 
he has given, and to receive the fine report that was made at the be- 
ginning of the conference with regard to the splendid condition of the 
Church, and the work that has been done in the past year. 

There is a great responsibility that rests upon every one who stands 
up to speak to this people. It is a fact that this is the people of the Lord, 
that this is the work of the Lord and that every one who is engaged 
therein has a responsibility to do his part in the advancement of this 
work. My desire is to help in the very best way I can to accomplish 
the designs of the Lord, in the advancement of his purposes and the 
welfare of the people. 

MARRIAGE AND DIVORCE 

I was interested this morning in what Elder Smoot was saying 
about the subject of divorce and the degenerative effects of divorce 
upon civilization today. Honorable marriage is of fundamental im- 
portance to the progress of civilization, and divorce is one of the most 
serious problems in the state of our civilization. In examining the records 
of marriage and divorce in the United States and in the Church, it ap- 
pears that the average marriage rate for the nation — the latest year in 
which I have complete information — was 10.28 per 1000 population as 
compared with 17.3 per 1000 population for the Church, or about 70% 
more for the Church. In the matter of divorce, the national rate averaged 
1.61 as compared with 0.76 per 1000 population for the Church, or about 
53% less for the. Church. In the instance of divorces after Temple 
marriages, the rate was 0.30 per 1000 population, or about 82% less than 
for the nation. Comparison of marriage and divorce rates in each case 
shows that in the nation the divorce rate was 15.6% of the marriage 
rate, in the Church generally the average divorce rate was 4.4%, and . 
after Temple marriages, the divorce rate was about 1.7% of the marriage 
rate, 

TEMPLE MARRIAGES 

A study of this information reveals the fact that of those married 
in the temples there are relatively very few divorces. It is to be ex- 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 83 

pected that such should be the case, and that those married under such 
impressive conditions and under a covenant with such sacredness and 
holiness, would not break the contract. When it is realized that such a 
covenant involves the unity of man and wife for all eternity, it is natural 
that each of the parties should not be hasty in taking this important 
step, but should seek to be fully prepared through love and faith to con- 
tinue this sacred relation throughout this life. To fulfil most fully the 
requirements for a happy marriage the two must be filled with true love, 
charity, forgiveness, mutual consideration and patience. They must have 
love for children, and be willing to bear children, and train them in faith 
and righteousness. It is evident that there are some cases where those 
who have entered into this covenant were not prepared through long- 
suffering, forgiveness and love to be united forever in harmony and 
happiness. The young people everywhere throughout the Church should 
be impressed with the great advantage that will come to them throughout 
their lives through being prepared to go to the Temple and enter into 
this covenant of marriage. From the information submitted above, it 
will be evident that temple marriage covenants are most helpful in main- 
taining happy homes, and love, peace, unity, patience and forgiveness 
between parents and children, all of which are most effective in develop- 
ing the finest civilization. 

PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY 

One of the greatest obligations resting upon the parents is that of 
parental responsibility. The duty of the parents to bring up their chil- 
dren in the faith and knowledge of the Gospel is co-equal with the duty 
of the Church to preach the Gospel in all the world. I desire to read to 
you a few words of scripture revealed by the Lord in the restoration of 
the Gospel in the 19th century, as contained in the 68th section of the 
Doctrine and Covenants : 

And again, inasmuch as parents have children in Zion, or in any of her 
stakes which are organized, that teach them not to understand the doctrine 
of repentance, faith in Christ, the Son of the living God, and of baptism 
and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of the hands, when eight 
years old, the sin be upon the heads of the parents. 

For this shall be a law unto the inhabitants of Zion, or in any of her 
stakes which are organized. 

And their children shall be baptized for the remission of their sins 
when eight years old, and receive the laying on of the hands. 

And they shall also teach their children to pray, and to walk uprightly 
before the Lord. 

And the inhabitants of Zion shall also observe the Sabbath day to keep 
it holy. 

May I also quote from Proverbs, the saying of the wise man : 

Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will 
not depart from it. 

One of our speakers yesterday commented on the fact that to train 
a child comprehends much more than teaching, because the training in- 
volves not only the instruction but the application thereof also in the life 



84 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday, April 7 Second Day 

of the child, and the observance of those principles and habits that will en- 
alble him to establish himself in the right way. In the Book of Mormon, 
King Benjamin declared (Mos. 4:14, 15): 

And ye will not suffer your children that they go hungry, or naked; 
neither will ye suffer that they transgress the laws of God, and fight and 
quarrel one with another, and serve the devil, who is the master of sin, * * * 

But ye will teach them to walk in the ways of truth and soberness ; ye 
will teach them to love one another, and to serve one another. 

HOME THE FOUNDATION OF SOCIETY 

The home is the foundation of society, and to the extent that there 
is a proper spiritual influence in the homes of this people, depends the 
right living of the families of the Church. Someone has said that "Home 
is the weakest link in the armor of the American nation," and a rather 
prominent educator from the East, who spoke at the commencemenl 
exercises of the University of Utah some years ago, declared that "the 
greatest contributing factor to vice and evil in America today is the 
average father and mother." Such serious indictments of the average 
family bring home to us, particularly, how important it is that no Latter- 
day Saint home should be included in such a category. 

PREPARATION FOR CHURCH MEMBERSHIP 

I desire to appeal to every Latter-day Saint parent — father and 
mother, — to be united with each other and their children in observing 
the principles of the Gospel, in the training of their children to take 
active part in Church service, and in seeking the Lord often in prayer. 
Can we not, all as parents, teach our children faith in the Lord and re- 
pentance from the follies of youth, and prepare them to be baptized when 
they are eight years of age ? Can we then not continue to encourage them 
in the performance of their Church duties? Can we not maintain the 
spirit of the Gospel in all our homes, and imbue the hearts of our chil- 
dren with a love of divine truth? The Church is greatly blessed in the 
splendid service being rendered by the various auxiliary associations for 
the benefit of the children and older members. These organizations are 
and can be of great advantage to all Church members. But, at the same 
time, it must be realized that parents cannot escape the responsibility 
that is theirs — the prime obligation — to teach and train their children 
to have faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, and in devotion to the Gospel 
truths, in order to maintain thereby happy, peaceful, united homes. 

AN ARMY OF YOUNG PEOPLE 

It would appear that the number of young people in the stakes of 
Zion under the age of twenty-one years approximates one-third of a 
million souls. What an army of splendid young men and women this is, 
and what a challenge to all the parents in all the stakes of Zion to ex- 
emplify the high standards of the Church, and to train their children 
in faith and righteousness ! 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 



85 



TRAINING OF CHILDREN 

The correct training of children is of fundamental importance to 
the child and to the happiness and peace of the parents. From its in- 
fancy up every child is entitled to the love and spiritual care which it 
deserves and which will establish it in faith and confidence in the Lord 
and in his purposes. As every boy and girl approaches eight years of 
age, they should be taught clearly and lovingly the atonement of the 
Savior for us all, and the first principles of the Gospel. This spiritual 
development should be carefully and wisely continued. Every young 
person should be encouraged to take part in the various Church activities. 
They should learn the value of prayer and of faith and the blessings 
which follow. It is a splendid practice for families to discuss Gospel 
principles and the application of the same in the lives of family mem- 
bers. They should be encouraged to read the Standard Church Works 
and to discuss incidents in ancient scripture and in Church history. They 
should learn the importance of gaining a spiritual testimony of the di- 
vinity of the Gospel restoration, and realize that such testimonies come 
through living the Gospel principles and observing the commandments 
of the Lord. 

HEALTH TRAINING 

In like manner, everyone of the family in childhood and in their 
growth to man or womanhood should be taught principles of health, and 
learn to observe health habits. They should be shown how much better 
and finer they will be through resisting the use of narcotics and stimu- 
lants. They must learn to differentiate between false, misleading ad- 
vertising of stimulants and narcotics, and true statements. No one needs 
to be misled by such alluring advertisements of cigarettes, for example, 
which are pictured as soothing and upbuilding the body, whereas in fact 
they are destructive to health and cause weakening of the vital forces of 
the body. Yet, because of the very extensive advertising campaigns 
carried on during the seven years from 1930 to 1937, the sale of cigar- 
ettes in this nation increased 18^ times. Young people should be en- 
couraged to read and study the word of the Lord as given in the Word 
of Wisdom. They should learn that the control of the physical appe- 
tites is one of the greatest lessons to be learned and practiced in order to 
maintain for their welfare the high standards of the Church. 

MORAL STANDARDS AND MENTAL DEVELOPMENT 

It is just as vital, also, that every member of the family should be 
shown, by precept and example, the obligation, for his welfare, to ob- 
serve high moral standards by cultivating clean thoughts and virtuous 
living. Parents have wonderful opportunities in the home to fortify 
their children against unclean thoughts, and to train them to occupy their 
minds with noble thoughts and good habits, to keep their minds and 
bodies occupied with positive ideas and activities and to put them on 
the way to a life of righteousness. 



86 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday, April 7 Second Day 

The training of the mind of every child can well justify the atten- 
tion of every father and mother, even though the education of the child 
is the responsibility of the State. It is a matter of excellent mental ex- 
ercise to converse frequently with our children on the various courses of 
study in which they are engaged. It is well to get the viewpoint of the 
child on all matters taught in the schools, and to advise and assist the 
the child to differentiate between theory and fact, and between prejudice 
and sound instruction on the part of any teacher. Every young person 
needs specific training in all the virtues — honesty, dependability, confi- 
dence, kindliness, patience, self-mastery, etc. 

DEVELOP LOCAL INDUSTRIES 

There is another phase of preparation for life of all young people 
that justifies careful attention on the part of parents, and indirectly of 
cooperation on the part of our families in the various communities. That 
is the matter of the economic welfare and progress of every young per- 
son in all our communities. It is just as important that every young 
man and woman shall receive specialized preparation for life in the 
trades or the professions as it is that all should be taught subjects for 
their general education. It has been said that "the primary and im- 
portant aim of education is not character building, nor learning, nor 
culture, but the development of the power to understand, and of the 
knowledge that understanding must precede wise action." It is unfor- 
tunate when young people are not given standard specialized training in 
some particular direction that will, in general, permit them to secure 
employment requiring some particular skill and knowledge, instead of 
having to depend upon common labor or untrained employment. 

In that connection, and in order to provide greater opportunities 
for such employment, there should be a concerted effort on the part of 
all men and women in the various communities, particularly in the in- 
termountain territory, to unite in efforts to develop possible local in- 
dustries that will employ local raw products in the manufacture of com- 
modities that will serve the immediate needs of the communities, and 
permit the sale of surpluses elsewhere. 

PATRONIZE LOCAL PRODUCTS 

Associated with such undertakings, and of immediate concern to 
the progress of these communities in providing more local employment, 
is the importance of patronizing to the full the local industries already 
in operation. Many purchases now being made by the housewives in 
these states are those from outside localities, whereas, in many instances, 
the same products are produced in our midst. If every mother could re- 
alize that every article locally produced will provide more employment 
for local young people and will probably be as wholesome and pure as, 
or more so, than outside products, and available at no greater cost, she 
would doubtless be more greatly interested in learning of all the in- 
dustries now in operation locally. Leaders in the various communities 



ELDER JOSEPH E. MERRILL 



87 



should carefully consider every feasible means of developing our re- 
sources in every direction, in order to promote employment of local peo- 
ple and avoid, as far as possible, the exodus of young people to other 
localities for lack of work at home. 

The challenge, then, is to all parents in the Church to lead their 
children into right thinking, clean living, specialized training, and in the 
faith and testimony of the restored Gospel ; and then to sustain all worthy 
efforts put forth to build up local undertakings for the economic welfare 
of our people. 

May we sense and improve our opportunities and may we strive 
constantly for better temporal and spiritual progress is my prayer in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

REASONS FOR CHURCH-WIDE CAMPAIGN 

All over the Church it is known that there is in progress a Church- 
wide Campaign for the Non-use of Liquor and Tobacco. No thinking 
person will question the need of this campaign. Perhaps never in our 
history did "evils and designs — exist in the hearts of conspiring men" to 
induce the consumption of these narcotics to as great an extent as today. 
Subtle propaganda was never more widespread, deceptive, or costly. 
In our country alone cigarette advertising during 1937 cost more than 
30 million dollars. The result is that cigarette smoking was never so 
general, particularly among women and girls. And sad to say, the 
debauchery of youth by deceptive marijuana appears to be growing. 

The situation with respect to alcoholic beverages is no better. 

NEWSPAPERS VOICE WARNING AGAINST LIQUOR 

A recent dispatch from Chicago carried by the public press, stated 
"more time and effort must be devoted to combatting the liquor problem 
among youth, according to recommendations made to the International 
Council of Religious Education by a committee on social issues, thor- 
oughly aroused over the lethargic attitude of the people as to prevailing 
conditions among our young people." 

This statement recalls other news items that appeared a few weeks 
ago. An investigation conducted by Allied Youth, Incorporated, found 
that 49 per cent of 4,000 high school seniors in eleven different states 
were drinkers. Further, the American Youth Commission of the Amer- 
ican Council on Education found that 52.9 per cent of 13,528 young 
people questioned in Maryland, used liquor in various forms. 

The Christian Science Monitor recently published an informative 
article on the liquor situation from which the following are extracts : 



88 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday, April 7 Second Day 

Recapitulation of the evidence for and against the liquor industry in 
the last five years leads inevitably to the question: "Was repeal worth it?" 
"He who runs may read." 

One argument for repeal of prohibition was : "Legal control of liquor 
selling will result in moderation." Beer consumption rose from 32,000,000 
barrels in 1934 to 56,000,000 in 1937 ; wine consumption from 45,000,000 
gallons in 1935 to 66,000,000 in 1937, and tax-paid withdrawals of distilled 
spirits from 58,000,000 gallons in 1935 to 87,000,000 gallons in 1937. 

The saloon, it was said, would not return. But drinking places, however 
designated, have quadrupled in number. 

Has respect for law been restored by repeal ? J. Edgar Hoover, head 
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, reports prison populations at an 
all-time high and crime on the increase. Was bootlegging wiped out? In 
1938 Federal Agents arrested 26,000 on bootlegging charges and destroyed 
11,400 illegal stills. In the "wettest city of the United States" huge bootleg 
rings have been uncovered. 

Recently-retired United States Attorney General, Homer S. Cum-' 
mings, in his report to Congress last spring stated "that there were more 
liquor law violations in America last year than ever before in our history." 

From press news we learn that last May, 19 people were indicted in 
what was called the biggest bootleg ring ever uncovered in the State of 
New Jersey. Last June reports stated a bootleg ring was operating in 
Chicago greater than the Al Capone syndicate of prohibition days and 
doing a two-hundred-million-dollar-a-year business. The first of last 
August, 106 people were indicted by a federal grand jury in New York 
for operating what was called the biggest bootleg ring in the history 
of the nation. 

This story of law violation and debauchery by liquor gangs could be 
long continued, but enough said about it except to note the claim that 
there is but little of it in this state. However, during 1938 the federal 
office sold 194 permits to handle distilled liquors, of which the state 
bought only 94. And the state is the only legal dispenser of distilled 
liquors in this state. Why did the other one hundred persons buy 
permits except to avoid running afoul of the federal government in their 
illegal traffic in liquor ? 

The United States Daily News stated that persons killed or injured 
on the highways by drinking drivers doubled between 1933 and 1937. 
Convictions for drunken driving have now become matters of almost daily 
announcement in the public press. 

The January, 1939 issue of the Journal of American Insurance 
carried a leading article under the title "Alcohol Held Major Accident 
Cause," in which the results of some capful researches were published. 

DANGER FROM INTOXICATED DRIVERS 

Would not one of the most effective means of securing highway 
safety be the elimination of the drinking driver ? We hear much these 
days about personal liberty, especially when measures to control the 
liquor traffic are being considered. But I maintain no drinking driver 
should be allowed on the public highways. The danger to life, limb and 
property is too great for this. 



ELDER JOSEPH F. MERRILL 



89 



OPINION OF UNITED STATES SENATOR 



I make two quotations from an address in the United States Senate 
delivered by Hon. Morris Sheppard January 16, 1939. The first is this : 

As we observe the gathering concern over conditions now surrounding 
the consumption of alcoholic liquors it becomes apparent that the so-called 
laws following repeal have failed either to control the traffic or to promote 
temperance. 

The second is as follows : 

It will never be possible to drink alcohol with physical safety. Alcohol 
is not by nature intended for beverage use. Its chemical properties and 
attributes are destructive of living tissue ; and you cannot change human 
tissue to give it immunity from such destruction. * * * In the interest of 
a higher and more efficient civilization beverage alcohol * * * must be 
destroyed. 

This we are now attempting to do in the Church by education. 
Abstinence is the simplest and most effective way of banishing all the 
evils of alcoholic beverages. But we certainly favor the strict enforcement 
of all laws and regulations for the sale and consumption of these 
beverages. 



Many times from this stand President Grant has urged the full ob- 
servance of the Word of Wisdom, basing his sermons on moral, spiritual 
and economic grounds. A few figures may be impressive. From official 
sources it was learned that there was paid in Utah during 1938 : 



If to this large sum we would add the amounts paid for cigars and 
tobacco in other forms than package cigarettes, for bootleg liquor and for 
tea and coffee, we would undoubtedly obtain a sum in excess of thirteen 
million dollars, or an average of about $24 for every man, woman and 
child in the state. 

Of course, members of the Church in Utah did not pay all of this 
money. Travelers and non-Mormons paid much of it. flow much, no 
one knows. But it is a fact that however little our people paid the amount 
was larger than it should have been. 

Now, it is only fair to say that though the per capita consumption of 
liquor in Utah is entirely too large it is less than that in any other state 
west of the Missouri river. Surely this is due to abstinence among the 
Mormon people. Iowa, New Hampshire and Vermont drink less per 
capita than Utah, but they are not tourist states.

SUBTLE PROPAGANDA 



There is a phase of liquor and cigarette propaganda that is especially 
dangerous because its objective is to popularize these poisons among the 
socially ambitious. To this end apparently no expense is spared, no 
deception too false to be used. Young people are inviegled into believing 
that social success depends on the adroit use of the cigarette or the 
liveliness flowing from cocktails. If indulgence in cigarettes and cock- 
tails can be made popular in any elite group or situation, temptation will 
be particularly strong for non-users in the group. For this reason 
L. D. S. parents should be especially solicitous about the character of the 
social groups with which their young people desire to become affiliated 
on school campuses and elsewhere. No amount of so-called social popu- 
larity can ever be weighed against moral and spiritual integrity. The 
former has fleeting, the latter enduring value. No success secured at the 
expense of honor and integrity can ever be permanent. These facts should 
be burned into the consciousness of all our young people. Who among 
us is gifted enough to make it "smart" to say "no" in the hour of tempta- 
tion ? Let him step forth. His services are needed. 



The waves of cigarette and cocktail indulgences flowing in upon us 
are as a call to energetic and persistent action of all friends of the moral 
purity and the physical, intellectual and spiritual vigor of our young 
people. I am happy to announce that one means to this end was the 
unanimous passage by the recent Utah legislature of two bills, one 
directing the public schools of this state to teach the truth about the evil 
and harmful effects of liquor, tobacco and other narcotics ; and the other 
directing the schools to become positive factors in character education. 
We suggest that all school patrons maintain a constant interest in helping 
the schools to the full observance of these two excellent laws, said by 
competent authority to be the best of their kind in the United States. But 
their value will be in their fruits rather than in their enactment only. 
The enactment of a national prohibition law in 1920 did not make the 
country dry. Prohibitionists largely went to sleep, forgetting that law 
does not enforce itself. 

Excellent as these laws are, until enacted in other states, they will 
apply to Utah only. But our campaign is Church-wide. While it will 
be our purpose to encourage the schools in anti-narcotic and character 
education, we have a program of our own that we earnestly solicit all 
Mormon people to help make effective. 



We have issued three little booklets that tell the truth in a plain 
interesting way why liquor and tobacco "are not good for man." The 
Lord did not say why when he revealed the Word of Wisdom 106 years 
ago, but he gave man the intelligence to find out. And man has done

BOOKLETS ISSUED BY CHURCH COMMITTEE

it. Two of the booklets give the facts upon which authorities agree. 
The other booklet is a powerful and convincing testimony of the value 
of abstinence. 

The objective of the first phase of the campaign is to get these book- 
lets read and discussed by all over ten years of age in every Mormon 
home. And we are asking that this be done during this spring. This 
done, we shall enter upon the next phase of the campaign which will be 
confined largely to youth. Zion will be free of narcotic evils when 
all its youth shall be so instructed and motivated that they will never 
touch narcotics. 

ASSISTANCE NEEDED 

To secure this end we must have the help of all mature people in the 
Church. This is why all need to read the booklets in order that they 
may be informed and able to answer the quest of youth for reasons why. 
This is a questioning age, made so by the teaching of all the schools. But 
we do not object to questions. The Prophet taught that we cannot be 
saved in ignorance. The glory of God is intelligence. We are spirit 
children of the Father and possess in embryo his attributes. It is our 
duty to grow in intelligence, knowledge, understanding, power and wis- 
dom. There is no excuse in this day for any normal adult being ignorant 
of why liquor and tobacco are not good for man. Our campaign for 
their non-use rests upon an adequate knowledge of their harmful effects. 

And this knowledge will certainly increase our faith in the divinity 
of the Lord's great law of health. As a matter of fact, is it not a lack 
of faith that makes this campaign necessary? No Latter-day Saint 
whose faith reaches perfect assurance will ever partake of things pro- 
hibited by the Word of Wisdom. 

And this leads me to utter a word of caution. There are some of 
our people who use liquor and tobacco, one or both. Do not think of them 
or treat them as bad. Most of them at least are good neighbors and 
upright citizens, our relatives, people of our own blood. They have 
become ifidulgents for one or more of many reasons, largely due to 
circumstances and environments. And all of us are influenced more 
or less by these factors. 

In the main this campaign will reach them only outside of meeting- 
houses and the congregations of the Saints. But to be complete it must 
reach them. But in all cases let this be done in a spirit of love and 
helpfulness, never in criticism or condemnation. Contacts can succeed 
in their purpose only if tactfully made. Hence workers going to these 
people should be sympathetic, discreet and wise, never offensive. But 
let us make sure that all of them are contacted and induced to read the 
booklets. 

OBLIGATION RESTS UPON CHURCH 

But why worry ? some among us ask. Are not drinking and smoking 
personal matters, and do we not live in a free country? The Church 



92 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday, April 7 Second Day 

has always had its critics both within and without its membership. Now 
the Church has a major obligation that it can never escape — that of 
preaching the Gospel of Christ, of doing missionary work. Whether we 
will or not, we are our brother's keeper. We must be active in the work 
of saving human souls, the most precious entities in the universe. 

The use of liquor and tobacco handicaps human beings, physically, 
mentally and spiritually. Knowing this we cannot escape the obligation, 
divinely given, of working for the non-use of these poisons. But I 
repeat, let us be careful of our methods, else our labors may do more 
harm than good. Let love permeate all our acts and wisdom characterize 
all our efforts. 

I have asked before and I ask again — is not the cigarette the greatest 
faith-killer in the Church today ? When we are free of its use we shall be 
free of other evils also. Faith will then be more abundant and its fruits 
much more plentiful. 

Let us unite in prayer, and good works to make ourselves more 
worthy of a greater amount of God's help in overcoming evil and building 
up his kingdom, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER ALBERT E. BOWEN 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

I want to talk to you today about a very old subject. It is about there 
1 eing inherent in religion, principles, through the general adoption of 
which, men could live together in the world in peace and order. 

BELIEF IN GOD THE BASIS OF RELIGION 

Among them I must give first place to belief in a higher power for 
that is the basis upon which all religion rests. At any rate that is true 
of our own. 

The first statement in our declaration of principles is, "We believe 
in God the Eternal Father." That belief is the root from which all our 
other tenets spring and draw their nourishment. It is the life-giving 
element of our religion. In it all the precepts of the Church, which give 
to man the assurance of a high destiny and help to steady his faltering 
steps as he journeys over life's troubled way, find their sanction. 

From it all Christian faith must draw its sustenance, for it is at the 
heart of all that Jesus taught. In plain words he declared that he 
came from the Father and would go again to the Father ; that the only 
purpose of his coming was to do the Father's will. It was to those who 
believe in the Father who had sent him that he promised everlasting 
life. His disciples were commissioned to baptize believers in the name 
of the Father, whose will he declared it to be that he should lose nothing 
of all that was given him but that all should be raised up at the last day. 
He said that he was come in the Father's name, and because he told the 
rulers that he was the Son of God, they sought to take his life. He 



ELDER ALBERT E. BOW EN 



93 



purported to do only that which he had seen his Father do. In the 
supreme undertakings of his life he sought the Father as the source of 
power, and when he succeeded he "lifted up his eyes and said, Father, 
I thank thee that thou hast heard me." He specifically taught men to 
pray to the Father, and the last words to issue from his lips as he 
expired upon the cross were : "Father, into thy hands I commend my 
spirit." There can be no doubt that he made the reality and the directive 
authority of God the Father the central theme of his teaching. For 
Christians, purporting as they do to be disciples of Christ, there is no 
escape ; they must believe in God who is the Eternal Father, for to deny 
him is to cast out Jesus whom they profess to follow. 

ANOTHER BASIC PRINCIPLE 

We come then to our second basic principle, namely, belief in Jesus 
as the Son of God, which flows of necessity out of belief in his teachings 
about the Father. There are, to be sure, many who recognize a great 
value in his moral teachings, the acceptance of which as ideals of 
conduct, they say, constitutes them believers in and followers of him and 
therefore Christians, without accepting his claims to Messiahship or 
ascribing to him the attributes of divinity. I presume most such would 
also exclude his teachings about God from their system of faith. For 
them the life and teachings of Jesus exemplify the finest qualities and 
the highest ideals of conduct yet discovered to man. These they do not 
want to give up but would preserve as affording the safest guides to that 
kind of individual and collective conduct upon which the future well- 
being of the race depends. 

Civilized beings, for instance, do not want to relinquish the distinctly 
Christian concept of the brotherhood of man for they know that in 
the development and expansion of that ideal lies the hope of humanity 
for an ordered world. But this at once involves difficulty again, for the 
brotherhood of man implies the fatherhood of God. Thus his very 
doctrine which by universal consent has in it the power to save our human 
society derives out of his teachings about God as the Eternal Father. 

After that the great theme of his message to man is immortality and 
the coming of the Kingdom of God, which are the next basic tenets to 
which I refer. All the rest consists in laying out the body of principles 
by the adoption of which man may fit himself to live eternally in that 
Kingdom. The record says that he "went about all Galilee, teaching in 
their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the Kingdom * * *." And 
when they would have detained him in Capernaum, he reminded them 
that he "must preach the Kingdom of God in other cities also." He 
commissioned his disciples "and sent them to preach the Kingdom of 
God," of which he declared "there shall be no end." 

Strip his words of all declarations and assumptions about the 
Father and his own Sonship, and about immortality and the Kingdom 
of God, and you have robbed them of their vitalizing force ; they lose at 
once most of their influence over the lives of men. It becomes apparent 



94 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday. April 7 Second Day 

that it is not easy to deny God and at the same time to cling to Jesus 
for any purpose, for it is the majesty of divine authority with which he 
invested them that imparts to his moral teachings their singular power. 
There is no other explanation of his so good as the one he gives of 
himself. 

The present day test of the validity of any claim is, "does it work?" 
That is but the modern equivalent of the test to which Jesus submitted 
his teaching. "If any man," said he, "will do his will, he shall know 
of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself." 

There is much testimonial evidence that the teaching stands the test. 

Christ's teachings a stabilizing force 

I name these great foundation principles of religious faith as among 
the forces that could bring order and tranquility into the collective life of 
mankind, because they are the greatest stabilizing forces known to human 
experience. And stability, enduring steadfastness, assurance that the 
foundation will always be there, are indispensable to the orderly existence 
of the human family in its manifold relations. 

From man's belief in God and in his own immortal life and in the 
Kingdom of God has come his greatest hope. Out of it has sprung his 
highest aspirations. Above all else it has sustained him in his often times 
disheartening struggle to give righteousness supremacy over evil in the 
world. Its widespread decline has ever been the precursor of spiritual 
decay and moral degeneracy — the sure heralds of national disaster. Ac- 
ceptance, on the other hand, of the teachings of Jesus about divinity, his 
Sonship with God and his brotherhood with man gives to human life its 
largest value, clothes man with his highest dignity and provides him 
his most powerful stimulus to noble living. 

JESUS AS A TEACHER 

It was about these beliefs as a framework that Jesus wove the whole 
fabric of his moral teachings. He unfolded them in the form of lessons, 
here a little and there a little, as called forth during the years of his 
ministry among men. They are rules of behavior. He called them 
commandments and he said that they came from God. 

While he dealt with an unseen spiritual world, where he said 
his kingdom is, yet his teachings are for men in this world. According 
to them life here is not and cannot be separated by any wide or deep 
chasm from eternal life, for the life of the individual is only one life — • 
a unit — in which mortality and immortality are but stages in a continuous 
course of progress. The experiences, the masteries, the attainments, the 
manner of dealing with the hard facts of existence as they are met on 
the way accompany life from stage to stage, make it what it is, give it its 
quality and tone, determine at every stage the degree of its perfection, and 
its capacity for entering finally into the life of the Kingdom. 

A GUIDE TO UFE 

Certain things man has to do. Not much stress is laid upon knowl- 



ELDER ALBERT E. BOWEN 



95 



edge but much upon understanding and habits of virtue and the cultiva- 
tion of a brotherly good will towards all mankind. He is taught that as 
in dealing with his f ellowmen he extends kindness, shows mercy, observes 
justice, practices self-denial, curbs ambition, denies greed, bestows love, 
banishes hate, gives succor, lives humbly, reveres right and respects the 
sacredness of human beings, he is contributing to the establishment of 
peace and good order and happiness in the world and is cultivating in 
himself those qualities of virtue which will raise him toward the level 
of his high destiny. 

These conceptions have tremendous power to stabilize a life that is 
guided by them. They also are among the principles of religion which 
I referred to as laying down the conditions of living, the adoption of 
which would bring order out of the chaos which now threatens to engulf 
the nations. I venture the assertion that harmony among men will not 
come, except as, and to the degree in which, they individually and col- 
lectively exemplify these principles in their lives. 

The qualities named, it is to be observed, are not physical in the 
sense that they admit of capture and dissection. They may not be 
segregated and looked at or weighed or measured. They are, however, 
none the less realities, as much so as the solidest objects of the physical 
world. Their existence may be as unerringly discerned. They shine 
forth in the deeds of those who possess them. They and others akin to 
them are the emanations of the spirit and are the most powerful forces 
in the universe. 

SPIRITUAL REGENERATION WILL COME THROUGH FAITH 

This mankind is beginning to sense. Now as never before in our 
time comes the call for spiritual regeneration. The very existence of 
our most cherished institutions is dependent upon it. In default of it 
the world is like to lose the gains of centuries of painful struggle upward 
out of the mist and to sink down again into the dark night of barbarism. 
The call is for those principles of religion enunciated by Jesus as the 
means of bringing back sanity to a world gone mad. No thoughtful man 
can be deaf to the cry of despair that is heard in the land. Let me cite 
you one from among many available illustrations. 

On Armistice Day of last year a group from among the most eminent 
statesmen of England issued an address to the people of the realm in 
which, among other things they said : 

Moral rearmament must be the foundation of national life as it must 
be of any world settlement. The miracle of God's living spirit can break 
the power of pride and selfishness ; of lust, fear and hatred, for spiritual 
power is the greatest force in the world. 

There are among all peoples today hidden resources of heart, mind and 
spirit waiting to be called out by common obedience to the supreme plan. 
Only in the fulfilment of this supreme plan can the true interests of all 
classes, races and states be secured. 

Throughout her long history this country never failed, and has not 
failed now to meet recurrent crises with the courage which each demanded , 
but a spiritual crisis remains and calls for action. The nation and the 



96 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Friday, April 7 Second Day 

empire must stand or fall by our response to that call. The choice is moral 
rearmament or national decay. That choice will decide whether ours is 
ultimately to go the way of the other dead kingdoms or whether our com- 
monwealth led by God may become a leader of the world towards sanity 
and peace. 

THE TRIUMPH OF RIGHT 

Cloudy as the skies may be, I am not one of those who despair for 
I believe in the triumph of right. In its consummation a leading role 
must be played by the Church, one of whose prime functions it is to 
transmute religious truths into living practices. The teachings of those 
truths and habits of practice becomes then the highest and most solemn 
duty of every person in the Church, and above all, of all those to whom the 
responsibility of leadership, in whatever capacity, has come, for therein 
lies not only the hope for eternity, but the hope of the world for stability 
and safety, here and now. 

This pronouncement comes from men of high intelligence and wide 
learning and deep penetration and ripe experience in the affairs of men 
and of nations. They have read the lesson of history and know that the 
decline of great nations has generally followed and been primarily due 
to moral disintegration. 

As Abraham Lincoln at Gettysburg called upon his countrymen to 
resolve that this nation under God should have a new birth of freedom, 
so these spokesmen of the British Empire have sounded a clarion call 
for spiritual and moral regeneration as the only means by which under 
God it can be saved from the limbo of dead kingdoms. That call is not 
for Britain alone but is for all nations and all people who love justice and 
desire to see her enthroned. 

ELDER MARVIN O. ASHTON 

First Counselor in the Presiding Bishopric 

I don't think ever before have I envied the presidents of the missions 
until this Conference. If you have noticed, yesterday and today, most 
of them had ten minutes notice before they were called on. This suspense 
sometimes is terrible. 

I heard of a good old lady once who was waiting for some news, 
either good or bad, she didn't know which, and when it finally came she 
said : "I do hate to be held in suspension." I want you to know that this 
good old lady had. no monopoly on the feelings that come from one being 
held in "suspension." 

If ever I feel the sacredness of an opening prayer, praying for those 
who would be called upon to speak, it is on these occasions, and I cer- 
tainly trust that the prayer offered today may reach the realms on high 
and be effective in my behalf. 

AN EXPRESSION OF APPRECIATION 

I, for one, right here, lest I forget, want to follow the suggestion of 
Bishop Wirthlin — I do want to express my appreciation for my affilia- 



ELDER MARVIN 0. ASHTON 



97 



tion, not only with the First Presidency of the Church, the Apostles, the 
Seventies, and others of the Authorities of the Church, but I desire to 
express the appreciation I hold for you fine bishops, you fine presidents 
of stakes, and not forgetting the members in general, that we contact as we 
go about. I do appreciate them, and I appreciate the sustaining power 
and influence that they give us as we travel around. 

As far as I am individually concerned, many things influence me 
and my testimony of the truthfulness of this Gospel, but there is nothing 
that stands higher, or that I consider more important than the lives of 
you fine people, because, after all, "the test of the pudding is in the 
eating." If the Gospel hasn't made such characters, good-by to the Gos- 
pel. I do want to take this opportunity to express my appreciation. More 
every day do I appreciate these things. 

WHAT OF OUR REAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS? 

I am not unmindful of the things that we are accomplishing in this 
Church. I would not want to be understood to think otherwise. I be- 
lieve we have taken a stride, a rapid stride. Before we get through, the 
eyes of the world will be consistently upon us, to the extent that they 
will see that we really have accomplished something, and in a big way, too. 

What does concern me sometimes is : Are we going just as fast as 
we ought to, and are we accomplishing just what we ought to ? Are we 
really, if you please, getting our toes in the ground as we ought, in every 
way we can, to accomplish what is ahead of us ? 

There is an expression they call "ancestral pride." I wonder if it 
hurts you, I wonder if it hurts me. I know what it did to the ancient 
Hebrews. Just what is it doing to you ? Do you stop still because you 
stand by to see what those before you accomplished ? One man has said 
that, "Ancestral pride is backing up to go forward." The other day, in 
Los Angeles station, I was waiting for the train to start. I couldn't see 
the trees overhead. I couldn't see the tracks below. All I could see was 
the train at the side, and all at once I thought we were starting, and soon 
I thought we were going at a pretty good gait. But in about two min- 
utes I changed my mind, because I found that I wasn't moving at all, or 
the train I was in wasn't moving at all ; just that train at the side. Do we 
sometimes think we are going somewhere, because we see the activity 
of something at our side ? I often think of that. 

I am wondering sometimes if I am too serious about what my 
grandfathers accomplished — and by the way, one of them helped to bring 
that machinery across the plains, with one hundred yoke of oxen, to try 
to attempt the manufacture of sugar. I am not unmindful of him. I am' 
not unmindful at all of what my father could do. My father didn't have 
much of an education, but he could build a city. I am wondering just 
how seriously we take this thing, and how much initiative, really, we 
have in and of ourselves. I am sure it is something to think about. 

If I have one prayer in my heart more than another it is that I may 
stand on my own feet, and look at this thing seriously and ask myself 
the question: Well, just what am I doing about it? Or- do I sit in a 




GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Second Day 



trance and see movement going on, and kid myself that I am moving? 
And I think it is the worst disease in the world. 



As has been brought out this afternoon, we have some problems 
ahead of us that ought to make us serious. When we are consuming 
four dollars per capita for liquor in the State anually, and in some of 
those villages or towns ninety-eight per cent of the people are members 
of the Church, it gives us something to think ahout. When we see 
returned missionaries wearing out the bottoms of their shoes in trying to 
get work, it is something to think about. I met a fellow yesterday, a good 
member of the Church. I hadn't seen him for thirty years, and the 
strange part was, I recognized him. Before we got through talking he 
said this : "The reason that so many people leave the Church, fine people 
sometimes, is because of the lives of our missionaries ; the way they fall 
aside." , I often think of the expression of Shakespeare, speaking of 
Cassius, "When much enforced they give a hasty spark and straightway 
cold again." Whose fault is it? It is theirs, a lot of it, and some of it is 
ours. 

When we see, all over this state, tumble-down houses, broken down 
fences, and things that are in a terrible shape, we have something to 
think about. When we see houses that were built by the early pioneers, 
and people still in them, and they have hardly put a shingle on the top of 
the roof since they were originally built, we have something to think 
about. And when we see the unemployment, it presents another problem 
for us to think about. 



I sometimes wonder if we are more interested in being well groomed 
around a mahogany table to pass on motions, than we are interested in our 
apparel being covered with the dust of real American initiative. I don't 
think we read enough, but I do wonder if we don't read more than we 
think, — we would rather read more than we would attempt to think. 

I sometimes think we would rather go around with a can-opener 
in our pocket to split the tin, going into the canned thoughts of some- 
body else, than we would do some honest-to-goodness real home cooking 
in the way of thinking for ourselves. 

I think these are challenges to us. I think we should get down to some 
real, honest-to-goodness, homespun initiative, that we should analyze con- 
ditions and see what is the matter. Whether it be grammatically correct 
or not, we should plunge into it, knowing we are right, and pull the trigger. 
I think that we ought to put more steel in the backbone of our young 
people. 



SOME PROBLEMS PRESENTED 



A PLEA FOR MORE THINKING 



EXPERIENCE OF A FARMER 



I am not forgetting the experience of that little German back in the 
Middle West, who decided that he could raise a better grade of corn. He 



PRESIDENT DAVID 0. McKAY 



99 



fastened paper sacks over the tassels so that he could control the polleni- 
zation of that corn. He got along fairly well. He almost wore himself 
out. First the grasshoppers came ; then the drought. His neighbor said : 
"Now, look out. You had better water it, better protect it." He said: 
"It stands just as it is, and we will see if it can take it." By the time he 
let that corn "take it" from the grasshoppers and from the drought, he 
had a kind of corn, in 1937, that just netted him about five hundred thou- 
sand dollars. 

I pray that the Lord will help us to really see situations as they are, 
and to give us the backbone to do things as we see they should be done. 
May he strengthen our testimony, and may we appreciate the leadership 
of this Church more every day of our lives, I ask these blessings in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT DAVID O. McKAY 

Second Counselor in the First Presidency 

The Nebo Stake Choir, which has furnished the music for this 
session of the Conference, is made up of the choirs of the various 
wards in the Nebo Stake. 

We thank you, brethren and sisters, for the excellent service you 
have rendered this inspiring Conference throughout the day. 

SERVICE OF PEACE OFFICERS COMMENDED 

You have undoubtedly noticed the care that the peace officers of 
our city are taking to direct automobile traffic and to protect pedestrians. 
The City Commission and the peace officers will appreciate our coopera- 
tion in their efforts to avoid accidents. In behalf of the Conference we 
wish to commend those officers who are in and around this block, who 
are rendering such excellent service for our comfort and safety. 



The Nebo Stake Choir sang the "Hosanna" anthem, after which 
Elder Peter J. Ricks, President of the Rexburg Stake, offered the 
closing prayer. 

Conference adjourned until Sunday morning, April 9, at 10 o'clock.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



THIRD DAY 
MORNING MEETING 

The fifth session of the Conference convened at 10 o'clock Sunday 
morning, April 9. 

A large concourse of people crowded into the Tabernacle far in 
advance of the time to commence this meeting, every seat and available 
space in the large auditorium and galleries, and in the doorways, being 
occupied by those who had come from the various sections of the Church. 
The large Assembly Hall immediately south of the Tabernacle was also 
crowded to capacity, and hundreds of people congregated on the Taber- 
nacle grounds, where, by means of amplifying equipment that had been 
installed, they listened to the Conference proceedings in the Tabernacle. 

The music for this session was furnished by the Tabernacle Choir, 
J. Spencer Cornwall, director. 

President Heber J. Grant presided and announced that the Choir 
and congregation would join in singing the hymn, "We Thank Thee, 

God, for a Prophet." 

After the singing of this hymn, the opening prayer was offered by 
Elder Clarence E. Smith, President of the Bear River Stake. 

ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

My attention has been called several times during this conference 
to the prophetic utterance of the Prophet Daniel where he said, speaking 
of our day : "Many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be in- 
creased." I never think of the words of Daniel that I do not have a 
vision of conditions according to the prophecy of Paul : "Ever learning 
and never able to come to a knowledge of the truth." 

KNOWLEDGE ALONE WILL NOT SAVE 

We have heard much at this conference in -relation to our duties 
in seeking wisdom from the best books, and faith. Much has been said 
in relation to our modem education, and I wish to say a few words 
in addition to what has already been said. We have been told repeatedly 
that the Lord said to the Prophet Joseph Smith: "The glory of God 
is intelligence." And we have also been informed that he said : "A 
man cannot be saved in ignorance." But the Lord said much more, and 

1 often wonder why, in making these quotations, we do not finish what 
he said. 

It is true that the glory of God is intelligence, but the Lord also 
added: "Or in other words, light and truth." Then he added this: 
"Light and truth f orsaketh that evil one." 

There never was a time I suppose in the history of the world when so 
much knowledge was in the possession of men. Surely knowledge has 
been increased, but at the same time the doctrine taught in this prophetic 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 101 

saying by Paul is true, men are ever learning but apparently never able to 
come to a knowledge of the truth. We have been informed that it has 
been said that our present system of education has taken man apart; 
it has done more, it has made a brute of him, and given him a brute 
ancestor, instead of placing him on the platform as a son of God, the off- 
spring of God, where he properly belongs. 

Dr. Frank C. Whitmore, a teacher at the Pennsylvania State Col- 
lege said : "Probably the biggest difficulty with mankind at the present 
time is that our knowledge has increased so much faster than our wisdom." 

The Prophet did say that a man cannot be saved in ignorance, but 
in ignorance of what ? He said that a man could not be saved in ignorance 
of the saving principles of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Not many of the 
great and the mighty, those who form and control the thoughts of the 
people of today, are going to find salvation in the kingdom of God. 
Why? Because they have not found the way; they are not walking in 
the light of truth. They may have knowledge, but they lack intelligence. 
Intelligence is the light of truth, and we are jnformed that he who has 
intelligence or the light of truth will forsake that evil one. A man who 
has intelligence will worship God and repent of his sins ; he will seek to 
know the will of God and follow it. 

REVELATION NEEDED 

Now I am going to read to you what the Prophet says in addition 
to the quotation which we have heard : 

As far as we degenerate from God, we descend to the devil and lose 
knowledge, and without knowledge we cannot be saved, and while our 
hearts are filled with evil, and we are studying evil, there is no room in our 
hearts for good, or studying good. Is not God good? Then you be 
good; if he is faithful, then you be faithful. Add to your faith virtue, 
to virtue knowledge, and seek for every good thing. The Church must 
be cleansed, and I proclaim against all iniquity. A man is saved no faster 
than he gets knowledge, for if he does not get knowledge he will be brought 
into captivity by some evil power in the other world, as evil spirits will 
have more knowledge, and consequently more power than many men who 
are on the earth. Hence it needs REVELATION to assist us, and give 
us knowledge OF THE THINGS OF GOD. 

Again : 

If you wish to go where God is you must be like God, or possess the 
principles which God possesses, for if we are not drawing towards God in 
principle, we are going from him and drawing towards the devil. 

Add to your faith knowledge. The principle of knowledge is the 
principle of salvation. This principle can be comprehended by the faithful 
and diligent, and every one that does not obtain knowledge SUFFICIENT 
TO BE SAVED will be condemned. The PRINCIPLE OF SALVA- 
TION is given us through THE KNOWLEDGE OF JESUS CHRIST. 

Now I understand that knowledge is very important, but there is a 
great fund of knowledge in the possession of men that will not save 
them in the kingdom of God. What they have got to learn is the funda- 
mental things of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. They have got to learn to

have faith in God. They must learn to obey him. They have got to 
learn his commandments, his ordinances and keep them, and unless they 
do, all their learning and all their knowledge will be of little benefit to 
them. 

PURE INTELLIGENCE BRINGS OBEDIENCE 

President Joseph F. Smith has said : 

Christ inherited his intelligence from his Father. There is a difference 
between knowledge and pure intelligence. Satan possesses knowledge, far 
more than we have, but he has not intelligence or he would render 
obedience to the principles of truth and right. I know men who have 
knowledge, who perhaps understand the principles of the Gospel as well as 
you do, who are brilliant, but who lack the essential qualification of pure 
intelligence. They will not accept and render obedience thereto. Pure 
intelligence comprises not only knowledge, but also the power to properly 
apply that knowledge. 

EDUCATION REACHES INTO ETERNITY 

On the subject of education President Joseph F. Smith also said : 

The knowledge of truth, combined with proper regard for it and its 
faithful observance, constitutes true education. The mere stuffing of the 
mind with knowledge of facts is not education. The mind must not only 
possess a knowledge of truth, but the soul must revere it, cherish it, love 
it as a priceless gem; and this human life must be guided and shaped by it 
in order to fulfil its destiny. The mind should not only be charged with 
intelligence, but the soul should be filled with admiration and desire for 
true intelligence which comes from a knowledge of the truth. Educate 
yourself not only for time but also for eternity. The latter of the two 
is the most important. 

I quote the following from President Brigham Young : 

Every man and woman that has talent and hides it will be called a 
slothful servant. Improve every day upon the capital you have. In pro- 
portion as we are capacitated to receive, so it is our duty to do. I shall not 
cease learning while I live, nor when I arrive in the spirit world ; but there 
shall learn with greater facility. And when I again regain my body, I 
shall learn a thousand times more in a thousand times less time, and then 
I do not mean to cease learning. 

Now I say it boldly, all the knowledge that a man can gain in this 
world or beyond this world, independent of the Spirit of God, the inspira- 
tion of the Almighty, will not lead him to a fulness, and in defense of 
that I am going to read to you from section ninety-three of the Doctrine 
and Covenants : 

For if you keep my commandments you shall receive of his fulness, 
and be glorified in me as I am in the Father; therefore, I say unto you, 
you shall receive grace for grace. 

And now, verily I say unto you, I was in the beginning with the Father, 
and am the Firstborn; 

And all those who are begotten through me are partakers of the glory 
of the same, and are the church of the Firstborn. 

Ye were also in the beginning with the Father ; that which is Spirit, 
even the Spirit of truth; 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 103 



And truth i# knowledge of things as they are, as they were, and as 
they are to come ; 

And whatsoever is more than this is the spirit of that wicked one who 
was a liar from the beginning. 

The Spirit of truth is from God. I am the Spirit of truth, and John 
bore record of me, saying : He received a fulness of truth, even of all truth ; 

And no man receiveth a fulness unless he keepeth his commandments. 

He that keepeth his commandments receiveth truth and light, until 
he is glorified in truth and knoweth all things. 

So with all our boasting, with all our understanding, with all the 
knowledge that we possess, let me say that this great knowledge that has 
been poured out upon man, and all that is truth has come from God, 
but with it all unless we humble ourselves and put ourselves in harmony 
with his truth and seek for the light which comes through the Spirit of 
truth, which is Jesus Christ, we will never gain a fulness of knowledge. 

I realize that it must eventually come to pass in the case of those who 
gain the exaltation and become sons of God, that they must in the 
eternities reach the time when they will know all things. They must 
know mathematics ; they must know all the principles of science ; they 
must be prepared in all things, by learning, by study, by faith, to com- 
prehend these principles of eternal truth, even as our Father in heaven 
comprehends them, and unless men will put themselves in harmony with 
him and his Spirit and seek the light which comes through that Spirit 
they never will reach the goal of perfection in these things. It is, how- 
ever, knowledge of the principles of the Gospel that will save men in the 
Kingdom of God. 

Now I shall read another passage of scripture from the Doctrine 
and Covenants, in conclusion: 

And that which doth not edify is not of God, and is darkness. 

TEACHERS SHOULD SEEK THE SPIRIT OF GOD 

Oh, if we could only remember that — our teachers in our schools, 
in our Sunday schools, in our priesthood quorums, and everywhere else 
— if we would understand that all that is taught which does not edify 
is not of God, and if we would seek to teach by the Spirit of God, how 
much better off we would be. 

That which is of God is light; he that receiveth light, and continueth 
in God, receiveth more light ; and that light groweth brighter and brighter 
until the perfect day. 

But if we are going to reach that perfect day then we must continue 
in God, and we cannot find that perfect day, the. perfect light of truth, 
independent of God. May we seek that light I pray, in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen.

PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 

First Counselor in the First Presidency 

Brethren and sisters of this great throng and of the air, — children 
all of one supreme God : today is the traditional day of the resurrection- 
birth of our Lord and Master, our Elder Brother, Jesus Christ, the 
Only Begotten of the Father, the Messiah that was to come, the Lamb 
of God, the First-fruits of the Resurrection, the Redeemer of the world. 
We may not forget this day, nor its significance for us. 

Heralded centuries before his birth as the "Prince of Peace" 
(Isaiah 9:6), heavenly angels announced his coming, saying: 

Glory to God in the highest,' and on earth peace, good will toward 
men. (Luke 2 :14.) 

RIGHTEOUSNESS AT WAR WITH SIN 

Modern man sometimes vainly thinks that Jesus' mission was to 
wipe out war ; and scoffers have cried that since war still curses the earth, 
Christ's mission has failed and Christianity is a blight. 

Yet Christ himself sent forth his Twelve, saying : 

Think not that I am come to send peace on earth : I came not to send 
peace, but a sword. (Matt. 10:34.) 

Christ did proclaim a peace — the peace of everlasting righteousness, 
which is the eternal and mortal enemy of sin. Between righteousness and 



PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 



105 



sin, in whatever form, there can only be unceasing war, whether in one 
man, among the people, or between nations in armed conflict. This war 
is the sword of Christ ; whatever its form this war cannot end until sin 
is crushed and Christ brings all flesh under his dominion. Righteousness 
is peace wherever it abides ; sin in itself is war wherever it is found. 

Sin and spiritual and mortal death came to the world through the 
fall of Adam ; these were overcome by the atonement of Christ. As 
Paul declared it : 

For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. (I 
Cor. 15:22.) 

Christ's mission perfect and complete 

The mission of Christ, planned before the foundations of the earth 
were laid, was to conquer death and bring the resurrection to each and 
every of God's children born to the earth. This mission Christ made 
perfect and complete. To fill this mission he needed no help from man, 
and no man can take from or add to it, no matter what man has done 
or may do. So Christ's mission has not failed ; it cannot fail. It is the 
perfect service finished, for it is the service of Deity himself. 

What today's world must have, if humanity is to go on climbing 
upward, is men — those wearing the cloth as well as the laity — who know 
that God lives and that Jesus is the Christ ; men who, having this knowl- 
edge, have also the intellectual honesty not only to admit but to proclaim 
it; and men who have further the moral courage and sterling character 
to live the righteous lives this knowledge demands. And this knowl- 
edge must be a living, burning knowledge of God and Christ. The world 
will never thrive, if indeed it can live, on abstruse ideals or an ethical code. 

Furthermore, to you men of all beliefs, truth is saying: The 
righteous life is not for the other man only ; do not hug this delusion to 
your soul. It will destroy you. The righteous life is for you and each 
of you also. 

RESPONSIBILITIES ATTENDING HOMEMAKING 

The chief place in which this knowledge and this righteousness, this 
peace of Christ shall be bred and nurtured, is the home, and yet through- 
out the world the modern way of apostasy, of idolatry, and of paganism, 
is threatening the home — the very bulwark of civilization itself. 

Everybody knows that home is not the four walls that keep out 
the cold, the wind, and the storm, nor the rooms therein that add comfort 
to the indwellers. These are merely the house under which the home is 
roofed. The home must have a husband and wife, with all the virtues 
that the Christian generations have given them ; and to this husband 
and wife there must be born children. Dogs and cats on the hearth, 
and blooded horses and cows in the barn, are not children and do not 
make a home. There must be a father and mother and sons and daughters 
of God in the home. "Multiply and replenish the earth," was God's 
command and is the law of all creation. 



106 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday, April 9 Third Day 

Among Latter-day Saints, children have a peculiar place and relation : 
They are the fleshly tabernacled spirits whose intelligences are co-eternal 
with God. Not following the rebellion of Lucifer, these spirits kept their 
"first estate" in heaven. They have come to this earth to receive the 
mortal bodies given them by us fathers and mothers, and to live their 
"second estate." If these children live rightly here, observing the 
principles of the Gospel and the commandments of the Lord, they will 
keep their "second estate," and will not only be resurrected, as will all 
mortals, but they will also be exalted and "have glory added upon their 
heads forever and ever." And this glory is the glory of intelligence, 
which is the glory of God. They shall have also the glory of eternal 
progression. This righteous family of father, mother, and children, 
with their loving relationships, will endure throughout the eternities 
to the glory and blessing of its members. 

NATIONAL STABILITY DEPENDS UPON TRUE HOMES 

Out of this purposeful, divine relationship of parent and child, 
comes a dual duty and love. 

To the child God said at the great day of law-giving at Sinai : 

Honor thy father and thy mother : that thy days may be long upon 
the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee. (Ex. 20:12.) 

This command is not spiritual only, it is not religious only, it is 
also political. It declares that in the nation which shall live, children 
must honor, that is, must hearken to and obey, their parents. This means 
there must be in the land the true home, and that without this home, 
so signifies the command, the nation will perish. 

Christ himself, as a child of twelve in the Temple, though knowing 
his divine mission, its meaning, and its source, followed homeward his 
anxious, sorrowing, and mildly reproving mother, saying only : 

How is it that ye sought me? wist ye not that I must be about my 
Father's business? (Luke 2:49.) 

FILIAL OBEDIENCE ENJOINED 

Out of the wisdom of the past we have to the children these words : 

Hearken unto thy father that begat thee, and despise not thy mother 
when she is old. (Prov. 23:22.) 

A foolish son is a grief to his father, and bitterness to her that bare 
him. (Prov. 17:25.) 

A wise son maketh a glad father : but a foolish man despiseth his 
mother. (Prov. 15:20.) 

My son, keep thy father's commandment, and forsake not the law of 
thy mother : 

Bind them continually upon thine heart, and tie them about thy neck. 
When thou goest, it shall lead thee ; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee : 
and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee. 

For the commandment is a lamp ; and the law is light ; and reproofs of 
instruction are the way of life. (Prov. 6:20-23.) 



Paul commanded the Ephesians : 



PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 107 



Children, obey your parents in the Lord : for this is right. 
Honor thy father and mother ; which is the first commandment with 
promise ; 

That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the 
earth. (Eph. 6:1-3.) 

To the wayward child, there comes the poignant wisdom of the 
immortal poet: 

How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is 

To have a thankless child. {King Lear, Shakespeare.) 

One of the things Christ told the rich young man inquiring as to 
what he should do to inherit eternal life, was to "honor thy father and 
mother." (Mark 10:19.) This duty so divinely imposed, carries with 
it to the child the obligation lovingly to care for the parent in poverty, in 
sickness, and in death. 

CHARGE TO PARENTS 

To the parent there are equal duties. The same wisdom of the 
past says: 

Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old, he will 
not depart from it. (Prov. 22:6.) 

And again : 

Chasten thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul spare for his 
crying. (Prov. 19:18.) 

To you parents it must be said : This precious spirit of God is here 
with you, because you willed it so. Your act, not his, brought him to 
you. He did not ask you to bring him to you. When you beckoned him 
into the flesh, you became responsible for him. 

You can do no act to thrust aside or, lay off from your shoulders 
that responsibility. That spirit, dear to God, is in your keeping. No 
other person can take your place. Our Eternal Father will hold every 
father and every mother to a strict accountability for the custody and 
guardianship of every spirit they bring into the world. 

REVELATIONS CITE PARENTAL LAXNESS 

The Lord in our own day has said that the "sin is upon the heads 
of the parents" that teach their children "not to understand the doctrines 
of repentance, faith in Christ the Son of the living God, and of baptism 
and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of the hands.'" 

For this shall be a law unto the inhabitants of Zion, or in any of her 
stakes which are organized. 

And they shall also teach their children to pray, and to walk uprightly 
before the Lord. 

***** 

Now, I, the Lord, am not well pleased with the inhabitants of Zion, 
for there are idlers among them ; and their children are also growing up in 
wickedness ; they also seek not earnestly the riches of eternity, but their 
eyes are full of greediness. 



108 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday, April 9 Third Day 

These things ought not to be, and must be done away from among 
them. (Doc. and Cov. 68:26, 28, 31, 32.) 

A little later the Lord spoke again : 

But I have commanded you to bring up your children in light and 
truth. (Doc. and Cov. 93:40.) 

To Frederick G. Williams he said : 

You have continued under this condemnation ; 

You have not taught your children light and truth, according to the 
commandments ; and that wicked one hath power, as yet, over you, and this 
is the cause of your affliction. 

And now a commandment I give unto you — if you will be delivered 
you shall set in order your own house, for there are many things that 
are not right in your house. 

Verily, I say unto my servant Sidney Rigdon, that in some things he 
hath not kept the commandments concerning his children; therefore, first 
set in order thy house. 

"And now, verily I say unto Joseph Smith, Jun., you have not kept 
the commandments, and must needs stand rebuked before the Lord; 

Your family must needs repent and forsake some things, and give 
more earnest heed unto your sayings, or be removed out of their place. 

My servant Newel K. Whitney also, a bishop of my Church, hath 

need to be chastened, and set in order his family, and see that they are 

more diligent and concerned at home, and pray always or they shall be 
removed out of their place. (Doc. and Cov. 93:41-50.) 

Paul speaking to the Ephesians, said : 

And ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath ; but bring them 
up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. (Eph. 6:4.) 

To the Colossians he said : 

Fathers, provoke not your "children to anger, lest they be discour- 
aged. (Col. 3:21.) 

CHILDREN TO BE TAUGHT GOSPEL PRINCIPLES 

Thus it is not now the doctrine of the Church, and it never has been, 
that children should be allowed to grow up to a maturity when they may 
choose their religious beliefs for themselves, before any attempt is made 
to teach them the principles of the Gospel of Christ, and the paths of 
righteousness. The Lord never intended that children should spiritually 
grow up neglected and cast adrift to care for themselves any more than 
he intended that the newborrr.babe should be thrown out into the street 
to live or die as chance might decree, or to wait until maturity to determine 
whether he should seek learning or remain in ignorance. 

On the contrary, the Lord has made clear in his revelations that, from 
earliest infancy, children must be taught in the principles of the Gospel 
and in the doctrines of the Church, else "the sin be upon the heads of the 
parents." "A child left to himself bringeth his mother to shame." 
(Prov. 29:15), said the ancient proverb. The Savior teaching his 
disciples, said: 



PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 109 



If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give 
him a stone? Or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent? 

Of if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion? (Luke 
11:11, 12.) 

Anyone who teaches, encourages, or spreads this doctrine of neglect, 
no matter who he is or what his position, will not be held guiltless before 
the Lord. 

This monstrous doctrine is founded either in a disbelief in all religion, 
or in a belief that all religion is for the immature and weak-minded, for 
the morons of society, or else that all religions, pagan, Christian, idola- 
trous, are equally good, all lead to the same goal, and no choice is to 
be made amongst them — all of which ideas are contrary to the revealed 
will of God, as his words all testify. 

CHARACTER TO BE BUILT IN THE HOME 

I repeat again, the prime, indeed the sole, responsibility for starting 
the child along the right way, rests upon the parents. This responsibility 
is the inescapable result of bringing children into the world. It cannot 
go unheeded, nor can it be cast off, or shifted to another. It is a responsi- 
bility that comes by divine decree. 

Parents may not assume that their work can be done by the schools ; 
and the schools shall not try to usurp the place of the parents nor to 
relieve them of their obligations. Each has its own place in building 
the upright, patriot citizen and the righteous man of God. So with the 
summer camps, with sports and other diversions — these, rightly con- 
ducted, may be helps to the building of youth character, but they are not 
homes and cannot be. If it be said that they are better than some homes, 
it may be answered then shame upon such homes ; they are not the 
homes which God has declared children should have. 

GREED FOR GAIN DESTROYING CHRISTIAN STANDARDS 

So also of the mere amusements of the hour — the theater, the concert 
hall, the movie, and even the radio in the home itself. Too often these 
are too much guided by the mere greed for gain ; all too frequently they 
pander to them of low morals and to the weakest in mentality ; too often 
they lack in simple decency and deserved shame. But when not going 
to these extremes, when in morals and ethics their works are not beyond 
the pale, yet in their ordinary offerings they too often depict a standard of 
life and conduct which is un-Christian. A Christian life is not built 
around cocktail lounges, exotic night cabarets, luxurious hotel lobbies, 
princely dwellings of idleness, and an ease and luxury that the imperial 
palace has rarely known. Yet the youth are coming to think that these 
are the norms of our life, and that if they do not get them, something 
is wrong with parents or society. The world has never had a people that 
were all millionaires ; it never will have. The sooner we know this the 
better it will be for the world. 

We parents may not trust the training of our children to any or all 
of these. If we shall do so and our children shall sin, then so surely as 
the Lord has said it, "the sins be upon the heads" of us, the parents,

Third Day 



PROPER TEACHING A SHIELD IN TEMPTATION 

Children should be home at night, every night, and not away from 
home; our youth should be home most nights, too, and the occasional 
night when they are away, they should be carefully protected by us 
parents, or someone for us, from evil in all its forms and guises. 

We parents must never forget and must ever remember that when- 
ever our children leave the home and its purlieus, for whatever reason 
it may be, whether it be for amusement, for learning, for matters of 
livelihood, or for the activities of religion and religious training, they 
have for the moment passed beyond our immediate protection and control ; 
they are away from our personal guidance and restraint; we may not 
then with our own hands and love and care minister to their need how- 
ever grave the need may be. We may send our prayers with them ; 
we may know that the righteousness we may have instilled into their 
hearts will be to them as a shield; we may, if we have done our full 
duty, know that the spirit of God will be with them, to guard and protect 
them. But we must also know that as they move out there alone without 
us, Evil will be there too, for so it has always been, and will be till 
bound ; and remember, the choicer the spirit, the more insistent are Evil's 
wiles and temptations to lead them to destruction. 

HOME FUNDAMENTAL TO CIVIC AND RELIGIOUS LIFE 

Again I say, not out of the school, nor the concert hall, nor the 
theater, not out of the stadium, nor the movie, nor the radio, not even out 
of the church itself by itself, nor out of all of them together, shall come 
the mutual respect for the rights of others, the restraining of will and 
selfishness, the due obedience to proper authority, the forbearance, the 
devotion to duty, the poorness of spirit, the repentance for sin, the 
meekness, the hunger and thirst for righteousness, the mercy, the pure- 
ness of heart, the peacemaking, the honesty, the sterling integrity, the 
charity, the love, the reverence, that shall make the citizenry of free 
nations and the subjects of the kingdom of heaven. 

All these must come mostly from the home ; they will fully come 
from nowhere else. To be certain and sure of their effect, they must 
be engendered in the forefathers of those who would enjoy them. This 
duty we parents of today owe to our posterity. Thus we must, as the 
Lord said through his prophet of old, "turn the heart of the fathers to 
the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and 
smite the earth with a curse." (Mai. 4:6.) 

God grant we may in this nation, and in the world, rebuild, fortify, 
and keep forever safe, the true Christian home.

Second Counselor in the First Presidency 

THE NEED OF THE WORLD FOR TEACHINGS OF THE SAVIOR 

Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified ; he is risen ; he is not 
here: behold the place where they laid him." (Mark 16:6.) 

Thus wrote Mark concerning the greatest event in the history of 
mankind. Throughout the Christian world today the resurrection of 
Jesus Christ is being celebrated. Perhaps never before was there a greater 
occasion or need for the world to consider and to apply the teachings of 
the Lord and Master, Jesus Christ. 

Declarations recently made by one or two rulers of nations indicate 
the unrest, political upheavals, the tendency to barbarism, in which 
"might makes right." These things are in direct opposition to the life and 
teachings of him whose resurrection from the grave is being celebrated 
today. 

One man recently said : "We must arm. The watchword is this : 
More cannons, more ships, more airplanes, at whatever cost, with what- 
ever means, even if it should mean wiping out all that is called civil life." 

"When one is strong one is dear to one's friends, and feared by 
one's enemies. Since prehistoric times the shout has come down on the 
wave of centuries and the series of generations, 'Woe to the weak'." 

Only twenty-five years ago such mad doctrine cost the lives of nine 
million men. Commenting upon that holocaust a recent writer says : 
"Why in the name of reason and sweet mercy, had this iniquitous bedlam 
come to pass ?" And then he answers : "The question is not new, yet 
it struck at me with fresh relentless force, and across my mind flashed the 
endless explanation advanced by human ingenuity, the talk of economic 
stress, of boom and slump, of unemployment and the rest ; of the rise and 
fall of nations ; the need for colonies ; the survival of the fittest ; the whole 
bag of tricks. How fatuous, how futile they all seemed ! For it was clear, 
acutely clear. There was only one reason, one basic explanation : MAN 
HAD FORGOTTEN GOD ! Millions now living were blind and deaf^ 
dead indeed to the knowledge of their Creator. For countless human 
souls that name was nothing but a myth. For others, an inherited 
tradition to which lip service must be paid. For others a convenient 
path. For others bland hypocrisy." 

And so I say today the line is sharply drawn between the teachings 
of Christ to love the Lord thy God with all thy might, mind, and strength, 
and thy neighbor as thyself, and the proclamations and practices of 
autocrats, who with radical disrespect for men, and the human ideals of 
justice, liberty, equality and fraternity, "relegate to the limbo of old 
superstitions, God, the soul, and moral law." 

To all who accept Christ as the Risen Lord, there can be no question 



112 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday, April 9 Third Day 

as to the error of the doctrine that "Might makes Right," that all who are 
weak must yield to those who are strong, or that any man possessing 
either political or financial power has the right to use human beings as 
mere things or chattels to be disposed of as any other pieces of property. 

Christ's apostles witnesses of the resurrection 

So let us ask ourselves, and ask sincerely, is it a fact that the 
crucified Jesus did appear after his death as a resurrected being ? Accept 
this as an actuality and you have at least presumptive evidence of the 
truth of his teachings regarding the sacredness of the individual as a 
child of God. 

That the literal resurrection from the grave was a reality to the 
disciples, who knew Christ intimately, is a certainty. In their minds there 
was absolutely no doubt. They were witnesses of the fact. They knew 
because their eyes beheld, their ears heard, their hands felt the corporeal 
presence of the risen Redeemer. Of the value and significance of such 
nearness and intimacy Beverly Nichols, author of "The Fool Hath Said," 
writes : 

The authors of the epistles were within hailing distance, historically, 
of Christ ; at any rate, when their ideas, which they afterwards trans- 
mitted to paper, were formed, the winds had hardly had time to efface 
the sacred print of his steps in the sands over which he walked. The rain 
had hardly had time to wash away, with its callous tears, the blood from 
the rotting wood of the deserted cross. 

Yet these men knew — I can't go on using the word 'believe' which is 
far too vapid and colorless — that God had descended to earth in the shape 
of a certain man, that this man had met an obscene and clownish death, 
and that the grotesque mode of his dying had redeemed mankind from sin. 
They knew, moreover, that he had risen from the dead on the third day 
and ascended into heaven. 

Nearness to the event gives increased value to the evidence given 
by the apostles. A deeper value of their testimony lies in the fact that with 
Jesus' death the Apostles were stricken with discouragement and gloom. 
For two and a half years they had been upheld and inspired by Christ's 
presence. But now he was gone. They were left alone, and they seemed 
confused and helpless. Only John stood by the cross. Not with timidity, 
not with feelings of doubt, and gloom, and discouragement, is a skeptical 
world made to believe. Such wavering, despairing minds as the Apostles 
possessed on the day of the crucifixion could never have stirred people to 
accept an unpopular belief, and to die martyrs to the cause. 

"What was it that suddenly changed these disciples to confident, 
fearless, heroic preachers of the Gospel of Jesus Christ? It was the 
revelation that Christ had risen from the grave. His promises had been 
kept, his Messianic mission fulfilled." 

On this point Spurgeon says : "On the evidence of these un- 
prejudiced, unexpectant, incredulous witnesses, faith in the resurrection 
has its impregnable foundation,

I urge the youth of the Church, students particularly, carefully to 
consider the testimony of these eye witnesses, whose honesty is not 
questioned even by skeptical criticism. 

mark's testimony 

The first of these to record his testimony is the one from whom I 
quoted in the text — Mark — who undoubtedly was in the presence of the 
Savior when Mark was a boy in his teens. We have no evidence that 
Mark joined the Church while the Savior was on the earth. Undoubtedly 
the Savior was in Mark's home. Mark was probably the youth who 
rushed into the garden of Gethsemane and warned Jesus that the 
soldiers were coming. At any rate we are justified in assuming that he 
was acquainted with the Master. 

Mark does not himself recount any appearance of the risen Lord ; 
but he testifies that the angel at the tomb announced the resurrection, and 
promised that the Lord would meet his disciples. From Mark we hear 
the glorious proclamation of the first empty tomb in all the world. For 
the first time in the history of man the words "Here lies" were supplanted 
by the divine message "He is risen." No one can doubt that Mark was 
not convinced in his soul of the reality of the empty tomb. To him the 
resurrection was not questionable — it was real ; and the appearance of his 
Lord and Master among men was a fact established in his mind beyond 
the shadow of a doubt. To the proclaiming of this truth he devoted 
his life, and if tradition can be relied upon, he sealed his testimony with 
his blood. 

Another who records the testimony of eye witnesses was Luke, a 
Gentile, or, as some think, a proselyte of Antioch in Syria, where he 
followed the profession of physician. (Col. 4:14.) Even some of his 
most severe modern critics have placed him in the first rank of an his- 
torian, and his personal contact with early apostles makes his statements 
of inestimable value. 

What he wrote was the result of personal inquiry and investigation, 
and was drawn from all available sources. Particularly he interviewed 
and recorded the declarations of those "who from the beginning were 
eyes witnesses and ministers of the Word." He avers that he "accurately 
traced all things from the very first," so that he might "write them in 
order." This means that Luke obtained the testimony of these "eye 
witnesses" directly from themselves and not from previous narratives. 

According to all trustworthy testimony, we have the Gospel of 
Luke as it came from his hand. In chapter 24, Luke testifies to the 
divine message : 

Why seek ye the living- among the dead ? He is not here, but is risen. 

With equal assurance as to their accuracy we can accept his state- 
ments and witness in regard to Peter's and Paul's and other apostles' 
testimony regarding the resurrection. "To whom also Christ showed 
himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs, being seen of 



114 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday, April 9 Third Day 

tfeem forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom 
©f God.'" Who can doubt Luke's absolute confidence in the reality of 
the resurrection ? 

It is true that neither Mark nor Luke testifies to having personally 
.'seen the risen Lord, and therefore, some urge that their recorded testi- 
monies cannot be taken as first hand evidence. That they do not so testify, 
and yet were convinced that others did see Him, shows how incontro- 
vertible was the evidence among the apostles and other disciples that 
the resurrection was a reality. 

Paul's testimony 

Fortunately, however, there is a document which does give the 
personal testimony of an eye witness to an appearance of Jesus after 
Ihis death and burial. This personal witness also corroborates the testi- 
mony not only of the two men whom I have quoted but of others also. 
I refer to Saul, a Jew of Tarsus, educated at the feet of Gamaliel, a 
strict Pharisee, and before his conversion a bitter persecutor of all who 
believed in Jesus of Nazareth as having risen from the dead. 

And now in the oldest authentic document in existence relating or 
testifying to the resurrection of Christ, we find Paul saying this to the 
Corinthians : 

For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how 
that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures, and that he was 
buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures ; 
and that he was seen of Cephas, then of the Twelve. After that he was 
seen of above five hundred brethren at once, of whom the greater part 
remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep. After that he was 
seen of James ; then of all the apostles. And last of all he was seen of me 
also, as of one born out of due time. For I am the least of the Apostles, 
that am not meet to be called an Apostle, because I persecuted the Church 
of God. 

In addition to the ancient apostles we have the testimony of the 
Prophet Joseph Smith who gives in an unequivocal description the follow- 
ing stirring testimony in relation to his first vision : 

There was a light, and in that light I saw two personages standing 
above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name, 
and said, pointing to the other : "This is my beloved Son, hear him." 

Later, as President Grant quoted in his opening address of this 
Conference, the Prophet gives added evidence as follows : 

And now, after the many testimonies which have been given of him, 
this is the testimony last of all, which we give of him : That he lives ! 

For we saw him, even on the right hand of God ; and we heard the voice 
bearing record that he is the Only Begotten of the Father. 

***** 

That he came into the world, even Jesus, to be crucified for the world, 
and to bear the sins of the world, and to sanctify the world, and to cleanse 
it from all unrighteousness ; * * * that through him all might be saved 
whom the Father had put into his power and made by him.

LATTER-DAY SAINT BELIEF 

Thus the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints stands with 
Peter, with Paul, and with James, and with all the other apostles in 
accepting the resurrection not only as being literally true but as the con- 
summation of Christ's divine mission on earth. Other great religious 
leaders among the nations of the world since history began have taught 
virtue and temperance, self-mastery and service, obedience to righteous- 
ness and duty ; some have taught a belief in one supreme ruler and in a 
hereafter, but only Christ broke the seal of the grave and revealed death 
as the door to immortality and eternal life. 

If Christ lived after death, so shall men, each one taking the place 
in the next world for which he is best fitted. Since love is as eternal as 
life, the message of the resurrection is the most comforting, the most 
glamorous ever given to man ; for when death takes a loved one from us, 
we can look with assurance into the open grave and say, "He is not 
here," and "He will rise again." 

Resurrection and Spring are happily associated, not that there is 
anything in nature exactly analogous to the resurrection, but there is so 
much which suggests an AWAKENING thought. Like the stillness 
of death Old Winter has held all vegetable life in his grasp, but as Spring 
approaches the tender life-giving power of heat and light compels him to 
relinquish his grip, and what seems to have been dead comes forth in 
newness of life, refreshed, invigorated, strengthened after a peaceful 
sleep. 

So it is with man. What we call death Jesus referred to as sleep. 
"Lazarus sleeps," he said to his disciples. "The damsel sleepeth," were 
his comforting words to the bereaved and sorrowing parents of a 
little girl. Indeed, to the Savior of the world there is no such thing as 
death — only life — eternal life. Truly he could say, "I am the Resur- 
rection and the Life. He that believeth in me though he were dead, yet 
shall he live." 

With this assurance, obedience to eternal law should be a joy, not a 
burden, for life is joy, life is love. It is disobedience that brings death. 
Obedience to Christ and his laws brings life. May each recurring Easter 
emphasize this truth, and fill our souls with the divine assurance that 
Christ is truly risen, and through him man's immortality secured, and 
may the day soon dawn upon the world when the manifestations of brute 
force and false ideals that might makes right be supplanted by the 
charitable, peace-loving spirit of the Risen Lord ! I humbly pray in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



The Choir sang an anthem, "Inflammatus," (Margaret Stewart 
Hewlett, soloist). 

Elder Scott B. Brown, President of the Weiser Stake, offered the 
closing prayer. 

Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock.

GENERAL CONEERENCE 



THIRD DAY 
AFTERNOON MEETING 

The concluding session of the Conference convened at 2 o'clock 
Sunday afternoon, April 9. 

Again the Tabernacle was crowded to capacity, the large Assembly 
Hall immediately south of the Tabernacle was fully occupied, and hun- 
dreds who could not find accommodations in either of these buildings 
assembled on the grounds, where they listened to the Conference pro- 
ceedings by means of amplifiers. 

President Heber J. Grant was present and presided at this session. 

The Tabernacle Choir furnished the music for this session, and sang 
as an opening number, "Holy Art Thou," (Handel), Rilla Petersen, 
soloist. 

Elder Eugene A. Hilton, President of the Oakland Stake, offered 
the invocation. 

An anthem, "Awake My Soul," (Stephens), was sung by the Choir 
(Myrtle Checketts and James Haslam, soloists). 

PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAWSON 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

My brethren and sisters, I have been thrilled with the exercises of 
this present conference. I was deeply thrilled with the singing of the 
Singing Mothers about fifteen hundred of them — it was wonderful. I 
have been greatly thrilled with the singing of our regular Tabernacle 
Choir here today. I compliment them on the fine work they are doing, 
and I verily believe there is no better choir in the world. I am thrilled in 
standing before you and looking into the faces of this vast congregation. 
It is certainly a privilege to stand here and occupy the pulpit a few 
moments. . 

PURPOSE IN LIFE BRINGS HAPPINESS 

Happy is the young man, and happy is the young woman, yea, and 
the older ones, if they shall have discovered the purpose of life in their 
youthful tlays, because if they have discovered it, it will help them to 
order their paths, and to live more intelligent lives. 

People sometimes say : "Well, yes, the 'purpose of life' : What 
does it mean? What does it amount to? We are born into the world, 
we live our earth life and pass on." What is the answer? 

The answer is that it amounts to a very great deal, that it is a serious 
matter, and should require our careful attention. 

"Brother Clawson, what is the purpose of life? Can you tell me 
in a few words ?" Yes, in one sentence. The Prophet Lehi said : 



ELDER RUDGER CLAWSON 



117 



Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy. 
(2 Nephi 2:25.) 

Perhaps the Prophet should have added that they might have a 
fulness of joy. That is the purpose of life. 

"Well, how is one to obtain this fulness of joy?" 

EXPERIENCES BEFORE OUR EARTH LIFE 

Ah, my brother, that is another question. But the Pearl of Great 
Price tells us that God ordained that his spirit children should pass 
through three estates, and we here who are his spirit children, and 
others, have passed from a former estate. We must have lived there, 
my brethren and sisters, a long, long time. We must have learned much 
by experience. It must have been a place of happiness, but it was not 
a place where one could attain fulness of joy. The time came in that first 
estate when there was war in heaven. A rebellion had broken out in 
that great spirit family, and we are told in sacred writ that Michael and 
his angels fought with the dragon and his angels. I have a few lines 
here, taken from the Bible, which give a brief description of that war 
and the results that followed. Permit me to read them : 

And there was war in heaven : Michael and his angels fought against 
the dragon ; and the dragon fought and his angels, 

And prevailed not ; neither was their place found any more in heaven. 

And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, 
and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world : he was cast out into the 
earth, and his angels were cast out with him. 

And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, 
and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ : 
for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before 
our God day and night. 

And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of 
their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death. (Rev. 
12:7-11.) 

Rebellion in heaven ! Could it be possible ? Yes, not only possible, 
but it actually occurred. These spirits at that time had their free agency, 
as we have our free agency, to choose between good and evil. And 
there was a class of spirits, headed by a prominent spirit named Lucifer, 
the Son of the Morning. He must have been a spirit of ability, a spirit 
of power and influence, and a spirit of great authority in that heavenly 
place. He stirred up the spirit of rebellion and sought to displace God 
upon his throne ; so he was cast down to the earth with his followers, 
a third part of the hosts of heaven. 

Others fought for the right and were faithful, so that the time came 
when the Lord said to one of the spirits : 

You can go no farther. You have progressed as far in this estate 
as it is possible. Go down to the earth below and take upon yourself a 
body, and then you may pass through your second estate. 

And, if this should be said to one, it would be said to all that great 
family of spirits, that each in his turn should go down and get a body, 



118 General conference 

Sunday, April 9 Third Day 

that this was essential to their progress. They came down, as we have 
heard, Satan came, and his followers who were evil spirits. 

And the young man went down, and we read in the Bible, second 
chapter of Genesis, that "the Lord God formed man of the dust of the 
ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became 
a living soul." 

So it was with all those spirits in that first estate. They came down 
and are coming to get mortal bodies and will be coming for a long time 
in the future. It was a vast group. 

EVIL PRESENT IN THE WORLD 

Satan is here with his followers, and the fight is still on. The 
righteous spirits find, when they are brought into material form, that they 
stand naked and bare as it were. If they are to battle with the evil spirits 
they must be clothed upon with divine authority. How is this brought 
about ? 

It is brought about in the manner stated by the Savior when he 
said to Nicodemus : 

Except a man be born again — [and that means every man and every 
woman] — Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom 
of God. 

And: 

Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into 
the kingdom of God. (John 3 :3, 5.) 

And so it was made plain by the Savior that in order to enter the 
kingdom of God it is necessary to be baptized by immersion in water and 
by the spirit, or Holy Ghost, by one having authority. There is no other 
way. But this birth by water and spirit, which simply and only gives a 
person a standing in the kingdom of God, is not sufficient. If the war 
which originated in heaven is to be fought over again on earth in the body, 
men must have divine authority as a preparation. The said authority 
consists of the Melchizedek and Aaronic Priesthoods. The battle is 
continuous and will be waged through the second or mortal estate. Satan's 
punishment and the punishment of his followers for their rebellion in 
heaven, Joseph Smith the Prophet said, is that they are denied mortal 
bodies. The said punishment is terrible and will make those who 
receive it most unhappy for the reason that they are halted, they cannot 
progress, they cannot go forward, cannot attain a full measure of hap- 
piness. 

Their eagerness to secure bodies is so great that in many cases they 
endeavor to steal the bodies of the more favored spirits, and when these 
evil spirits enter into and take possession of the bodies of others we say 
of those afflicted that they are possessed by evil spirits. They can only 
be subdued and cast out of stolen bodies by those members of Christ's 
Church who are under divine authority. 



ELDER RUDGER CL/UVSOS 



119 



A SCHOOL OF EXPERIENCE 

They who pass through the second estate will be tried and tested 
to the uttermost, because it is said of them that if they keep their second 
estate glory will be added upon their heads forevermore, while those 
who do not keep their second estate but rebel against the God of heaven 
and against the Priesthood and power of God will be defeated and go 
down to destruction. 

The great majority of Latter-day Saints are making a gallant fight. 
Some are putting more effort into it than others and therefore accomplish 
more than others. Surely the second estate is a great school of experience ; 
a variety of conditions are encountered — sickness, disease, misfortune, 
disappointment, sins of commission, sins of omission, days of happiness 
and days of sorrow. 

In this estate the children of God are sorely tried that it may be 
seen whether or not they will keep the commandments of God and will 
live by every word that proceedeth forth from his mouth. If they are 
faithful they will rise to exaltation and glory in their third estate, as 
already mentioned. 

That there is a definite purpose of life is further shown by the follow- 
ing paragraphs in the Doctrine and Covenants, Section 93, verses 33-34 : 

For man is spirit. The elements are eternal, and spirit and element, 
inseparably connected, receive a fulness of joy; 

And when separated, man cannot receive a fulness of joy. 

I apprehend, my brethren and sisters, that it is our supremest desire 
to secure this great, if not the greatest of all blessings. 

A FULNESS OF JOY 

Another thing : Before we can enter into full and complete exalta- 
tion and glory and receive a fulness of joy we must take into account 
the sublime doctrine of marriage. It is necessary to our final exaltation. 
The man and woman were created together, or in other words it was one 
creative act. In the Garden of Eden it was found not to be right for 
Adam to live alone. Therefore Eve was created and given to him for a. 
companion, a helpmate, that he as a king and a priest and she as a queen 
and priestess might rise to exaltation and glory and together receive 
a fulness of joy. 

I rejoice, my brethren and sisters, today in the glorious oppor- 
tunities that are before us to win a crown in the kingdom of our God. 
The victory is within our reach if we will only take hold and make the 
best of our opportunities. 

THE BODY A PRECIOUS GIFT 

Let me say in a few closing words how important it is that we 
should look after these mortal bodies that God has given us. They are 
precious gifts from heaven. It is not only proper and right that we 
should look after our spirits, for that is what constitutes the life within 
the body, but we should also look after our bodies. Is it any wonder 



120 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday, April 9 Third Day 

that the Church has organized a campaign against liquor and tobacco 
which are so hurtful to the body, and in a measure defile the body ? There 
are other things also that weaken the body — immorality, etc. We should 
remember that we are to lay these bodies down and take them up again 
as the Savior laid his body down and took it up. He was the first fruits 
of the resurrection, and he holds the keys of the resurrection. So, as he 
has gone down and come up, surely his brethren will go down and come 
up and be resurrected. And it is therefore very desirable that we should 
take up our bodies free from sin and defilement. 

Now, I shall just read these few lines to close my remarks : 

I live for those who love me, 

For those who know me true, 
For the heaven that smiles above me, 

And awaits my spirit, too ; 

For the cause that lacks assistance, 
For the wrong that needs resistance, 
For the future in the distance, 
And the good that I can do. 

God bless you, brethren and sisters. The Lord bless the Presidency 
of this Church, and the Twelve, and the First Council of Seventy, and 
all the presiding authorities, the authorities in the stakes of Zion, the 
authorities in the mission fields. May peace and blessing and success 
attend you is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

This has been a glorious occasion ; we have delightful weather, com- 
fort and peace. We rejoice in both the speaking and the music, and I do 
not know of any people in all the world who has more reason to be grate- 
ful to our Heavenly Father than the group that is assembled at this con- 
ference. 

EVIDENCES ESTABLISHING THE FACT OF THE RESURRECTION 

Today we are celebrating what the Christian world calls Easter, the 
anniversary of the resurrection of Jesus Christ our Lord, who was the first 
fruits of the resurrection from the dead. 

We have had some splendid information imparted to us in this con- 
ference. Surely if there is anything more pleasing than the knowledge 
that we are living eternal life, it is that the Lord in his mercy has bestowed 
upon us the information necessary to enable us to enjoy that eternal life 
in the highest glory. 

We possess all that the world knows with reference to the resurrection 
from the dead, and in addition we have other important information con- 
cerning it. We accept without reservation the testimony of all of the 
evangelists contained in the New Testament with reference to the resur- 
rection of the Redeemer of mankind. It is so plain that it seems to me 
that no thoughtful person can fail to comprehend it. The fact is that 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 



121 



after the Savior was crucified and was laid in the tomb he came forth, and 
for forty days he associated with his disciples, he partook of fish and 
honeycomb with them, they felt the prints of the nails in his hands and 
the spear mark in his side. He declared to them while he stood among 
them, "Behold my hands and my feet that it is I myself : handle me and see 
for a spirit hath not flesh and bones as ye see me have." Surely this is 
incontrovertible evidence and yet there are many of our Father's children 
who do not understand it. 

We read in Job, "But there is a spirit in man ; and the inspiration of 
the Almighty giveth them understanding." Those who have not received 
that inspiration will not comprehend the meaning of the resurrection 
from the dead, and without that understanding it seems to me there would 
be little happiness for those who are living in mature years, waiting for 
the time when the spirit leaves the body to go they know not where. 

ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY IN THE BOOK OF MORMON 

The Lord has favored us. He not only gives us the evidence con- 
tained in the Bible but in addition the testimony that we find recorded in 
the American scripture, the Book of Mormon, III Nephi, Chapter 2. After 
the Savior had been crucified and resurrected and ascended into heaven 
a great multitude of people were assembled around the temple in the 
land Bountiful on this western hemisphere, marveling at the changes 
that had been wrought. They heard an unusual voice repeated three 
times. It was not a loud voice, neither was it a harsh voice, and yet it 
pierced them to their very centers. Looking toward the sound they saw 
a man descending out of heaven. He was clothed in a white robe, and 
he came down and stood in the midst of them and declared to them, 
"Behold I am Jesus Christ whom the prophets testified should come into 
the world." 

What more direct evidence of resurrection from the dead could have 
beenhad than that he, in his resurrected body, came among them and taught 
them the same Gospel that he taught in Jerusalem. And he now fulfilled 
the promise he had made in Jerusalem when he said, "Other sheep I 
have which are not of this fold ; them also I must bring and they 
shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold and one shepherd." He 
came in his resurrected body to bring to them the information he had pre- 
dicted should be given to those to whom he now ministered. 

It was a wonderful experience for those people. After teaching 
them all day he told them that he must leave them but would return on 
the morrow, which he did, to find a much larger group assembled. He 
healed their sick and blessed their children and continued to instruct 
them in the beauty of his Gospel. There was no doubt in their minds that 
he was the Savior of the world. They saw him come from heaven and 
witnessed his marvelous power. He did not come to them as a little 
babe, helpless in the hands of his enemies, but he came in glory. Angels 
came down from heaven as it were in the midst of fire and surrounded 
the little children so that they were encircled with fire. And the angels 
did minister unto them. 



122 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday. April 9 Third Day 

Those were not hallucinations, but experiences of such marvelous 
character as to be remembered forever by those who experienced them. 
As Latter-day Saints we accept this record as evidence of the resurrection 
of Jesus Christ our Lord. 

JOSEPH SMITH'S EXPERIENCE 

When Joseph Smith, not yet fifteen years of age, read in James 1 :5 
"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men 
liberally, and upbraideth not ; and it shall be given him," he believed 
what he read. He was not reared in ignorance as some have supposed. 
His father was a successful school teacher. The Bible was a sacred 
volume in their home library. When he read that the Lord would give 
wisdom to those who asked for it, he went into the woods nearby and he 
knelt down and prayed. 

In answer to his prayer he beheld the Father and the Son. Not only 
did he see them, but he heard their voices, first the Father saying : "This 
is my beloved Son ; hear ye him !" And then the Son spoke to him and 
answered his questions. Joseph wanted to know which Church to join 
and was informed that he should join none of them, because they were 
not doing what the Lord desired them to do. He was informed then and 
later that there was work for him to do. It was a little over a hundred 
years ago when that occurred, but what Joseph saw and heard had a 
great influence on the religious world. 

DIRECT REVELATION FROM GOD 

In our day we have the Bible, we have the Book of Mormon which 
was given to Joseph Smith by our Heavenly Father, and we have the 
revelations of God in the Doctrine and Covenants. We have the witness 
of others who have had angels visit them and who testified regarding 
sacred things. In the Kirtland temple marvelous manifestations were 
witnessed by faithful men, all contributing to assurance of a literal resur- 
rection. 

The resurrection ought to be an easy thing for us to understand. 
Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery received the laying on of hands of 
those who had been with the Savior as disciples in Judea. They conferred 
the Priesthood upon them and explained to them the teachings of Jesus 
Christ as contained in the Holy Bible. 

We ought to be grateful. No other people in the world have been 
so blessed as we. We should evidence our belief in Jesus Christ by living 
in such a way that we will be worthy of the inspiration of God's Holy 
Spirit. We can if we will live in accordance with the things that have 
been revealed to us. Now, with reference to the resurrection of the 
Savior, there is no doubt. 

We may turn to section 88 of the Doctrine and Covenants and see 
what the Lord has said about our resurrection, not only the resurrection 
of the Savior, but he tells us what may happen to us, and I will read so 
that I shall not misquote : 

Now, verily I say unto you, that through the redemption which is 
made for you is brought to pass the resurrection from the dead. 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 



123 



And the spirit and the body are the soul of man. 

And the resurrection from the dead is the redemption of the soul. 

And the redemption of the soul is through him that quickeneth all 
things, in whose bosom it is decreed that the poor and the meek of the 
earth shall inherit it. 

Therefore, it must needs be sanctified from all unrighteousness, that it 
may be prepared for the celestial glory; 

For after it hath filled the measure of its creation, it shall be crowned 
with glory, even with the presence of God the Father; 

That bodies who are of the celestial kingdom may possess it forever 
and ever; for, for this intent was it made and created, and for this intent 
are they sanctified. 

And they who are not sanctified through the law which I have given 
unto you, even the law of Christ, must inherit another kingdom, even that 
of a terrestrial kingdom, or that of a telestial kingdom. 

For he who is not able to abide the law of a celestial kingdom cannot 
abide a celestial glory. 

And he who cannot abide the law of a terrestrial kingdom cannot 
abide a terrestrial glory. 

And he who cannot abide the law of a telestial kingdom cannot abide 
a telestial glory ; therefore he is not meet for a kingdom of glory. There- 
fore he must abide a kingdom which is not a kingdom of glory. 

And again, verily I say unto you, the earth abideth the law of a 
celestial kingdom, for it filleth the measure of its creation, and transgresseth 
not the law — 

Wherefore, it shall be sanctified; yea, notwithstanding it shall die, it 
shall be quickened again, and shall abide the power by which it is quickened, 
and the righteous shall inherit it. 

For notwithstanding they die, they also shall rise again, a spiritual body. 

They who are of a celestial spirit shall receive the same body which 
was a natural body ; even ye shall receive your bodies, and your glory shall 
be that glory by which your bodies are quickened. 

Ye who are quickened by a portion of the celestial glory shall then 
receive of the same, even a fulness. 

And they who are quickened by a portion of the terrestrial glory shall 
then receive of the same, even a fulness. 

And also they who are quickened by a portion of the telestial glory 
shall then receive of the same, even a fulness. 

And they who remain shall also be quickened ; nevertheless, they shall 
return again to their own place, to enjoy that which they are willing to re- 
ceive, because they were not willing to enjoy that which they might have 
received. 

For what doth it profit a man if a gift is bestowed upon him, and he 
receive not the gift? Behold, he rejoices not in that which is given unto 
him, neither rejoices in him who is the giver of the gift. 

We are informed in this section that our bodies are to be raised from 
the tomb, not some other bodies, and that the spirits that possess these 
tabernacles now will inhabit the same tabernacles after they have been 
cleansed and purified and immortalized. 

BLESSINGS BRING RESPONSIBILITY 

I think we would be a very ungrateful people if, with all the infor- 
mation that God has bestowed upon us for our comfort and blessing (and 
he has told us that we must divide that information with all the world), 
we did not go a long way and make many sacrifices for our Father's other 
children who are precious in his sight, that they might know what he has 
revealed to us. There will be many who will not understand, but th§ 



124 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday, April 9 Third Day 

Lord intends that all shall have an opportunity to know, and it will be our 
duty and responsibility to see that this Gospel is proclaimed in all parts 
of the world for the blessing of all who will receive it. 

We know all that the world knows with reference to the resurrection. 
We have all that the world has with reference to other truths. We have 
the authority of the Holy Priesthood bestowed upon men in this dispen- 
sation to prepare the human family for the Celestial kingdom. 

I wonder if we appreciate how blessed we are in having all that our 
brethren and sisters of the world have and in addition these other op- 
portunities. With these opportunities and responsibility we ought to set 
our homes in order. We ought to teach the Gospel of Jesus Christ to 
our children and to our grandchildren, and to our great grandchildren 
if we live long enough. There is nothing more precious to us than our 
children, and our eternal happiness will be largely conditioned by what 
they attain to. The Lord has given us to understand what it all means. 
Surely we will not betray his confidence in us by failing to do the thing 
that we know we should do. 

INSPIRATION GIVES UNDERSTANDING 

Mention has been made during this conference of the failure of many 
of the Latter-day Saints to obey the commandments of our Heavenly 
Father with reference to the Word of Wisdom. As simple a thing as 
refusing or failing to obey the Word of Wisdom may deprive us of the 
companionship of that Spirit that would enable us to understand other 
important truths. There is a spirit in man but it requires the inspiration 
of the Almighty to give it understanding, and if we want that under- 
standing we must live for it. There will be no doubt about it if we ob- 
serve the commandments of God. We will not need the testimony of 
others to know that this work is true. When the disciples of the Savior 
were with him they admired him not knowing how great he really was, 
but not until the power of the Holy Ghost came upon them, not until 
they had the baptism of fire were they able to face the problems and en- 
dure the persecutions that almost made life unendurable. When the 
inspiration of the Almighty gave them understanding they knew they 
were living eternal life, and if they proved faithful they knew that when 
they laid their bodies down in death they would be raised from the tomb 
to glory and immortality. 

That was the result of the inspiration of the Spirit of God that came 
upon them, the inspiration of the Almighty that gave them understanding. 
If there is any doubt in the mind of any man or woman in this Church 
who has been baptized and repented of their sins and who has had hands 
laid upon them for the gift of the Holy Ghost — if there is any doubt in 
their minds of the truth and divinity of this work it is because they have 
failed to measure up, it is because they have transgressed the laws of 
God, and because they have not kept the light of truth burning in their 
souls. We need repentance if that occurs to us ; otherwise that assurance 
may depart from us to return again no more.

JOY IN LABORING IN THE CHURCH 

Standing in your presence as I do today I am grateful for my bless- 
ings, I am thankful for your companionship. It is a joy to be associated 
with men such as lead this Church — these who are upon this stand. I can 
testify to you as one who knows them from personal contact that they 
are men of God, but they are men. They may make some mistakes, but 
they will correct them. They are holy men who are seeking the will of 
God and for that inspiration that gives them understanding. It is a joy 
to labor with them and to have contact with them and I thank my Heaven- 
ly Father for that privilege I am grateful to be your companion in this 
great Church, for the opportunity I have of visiting the Stakes of Zion 
and the missionary field. I am thankful for the privilege that has been 
mine to associate with good men and women, many of them not members 
of this Church. But our Heavenly Father desires that they shall have 
an understanding of the truth, that they may take advantage of their 
privileges while they are here. It is your duty and mine to let our light 
so shine that others observing our upright lives will be constrained to 
glorify the name of him who is the Author of our being. It is our privi- 
lege to do that and if we fail it will not be because we have not known 
better. 

I pray that that Spirit which keeps us in the pathway of truth and 
righteousness may abide with us, and I pray that that desire that comes 
from the inspiration of our Heavenly Father may direct us on that path- 
way of life. Some of us may not be here many years more, and today 
is the acceptable time of the Lord for every one of us to atone for the 
mistakes we have made and repent of our sins and come to him with a 
broken heart and a contrite spirit, with a desire that we may be forgiven 
of our mistakes and rejoice in the companionship of his Spirit while we 
remain upon the earth. 

That God may add his blessings and that the joy that comes from 
him alone may fill your hearts and your homes, that wherever you go 
you may be leaders of ability and teachers of righteousness among the 
children of men, and when the time comes for us to go hence that we may 
receive from our Heavenly Father that glorious welcome, "Well done, 
thou good and faithful servant, thou hast been faithful over a few things, 
I will make thee ruler over many things, enter thou into the joy of thy 
Lord," I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. 

ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

This conference is a spiritual feast, a feast of fat things for the 
righteous prepared. Just before the close of this morning's meeting 
these words came to my mind. "Certain Greeks came to Philip, saying, 
'Sir, we would see Jesus'." 

JESUS MOVING AMONG MEN 

In the heavenly bodies, in the skies, God may be seen moving in his 



126 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday. April 9 Third Day 

majesty and glory. The stars, those rounded orbits of light, the sun and 
the moon and the heavens declare the glory of God, but they do not de- 
clare his will. I would see Jesus moving among men, giving uplift of 
spirit to the distressed in mind and in body. 

Tennyson was asked by a friend : "What does Jesus Christ mean 
to you personally ?" 

The great poet replied : "Christ means to me what the sun means 
to the rosebush." 

I am thankful that the philosophy of our religion gives me the 
comfort of a personal God, who hears the widow's mournful cry, "sends 
the laboring conscience peace, and grants the prisoner sweet relief." I 
think it was Victor Hugo who said that of all the names of Deity, com- 
passion was the most beautiful, and God is a compassionate being. "So 
nigh is grandeur to our dust, so near is God to man." 

THE ROAD TO HEAVEN 

In the Book of Mormon we read that the great Creator suffered and 
bled on the cross, died for all men, that all men might become subject 
unto him. Jesus became subject unto man in the flesh. He was the 
suffering servant, the personification of service. Service was the road 
his sanctified and heavenly feet trod, and in all the philosophy of the 
world, yea in the philosophy of religion, the only road to heaven is the 
road of service. This shines like a gem. 

What glorifies a mother? She becomes subject unto her children 
and serves them, wearing out her splendid life to care for them. My 
brethren and sisters, if our children fail we too fail, in a measure at 
least. In this great Church Welfare movement, I see the spirit of Christ 
moving in compassion, in grandeur, in mercy, and in pity among the 
unfortunate children of men who are not blessed with much of this 
world's goods. 

Do you want to taste heaven ? Do you want to feel the presence of 
Christ? Then go with the Elders who have these charitable projects in 
hand. Minister to the needy, give aid to the worthy poor, teach people 
to work, to become independent. The fulness and the majesty of man- 
hood rests upon him who is willing and anxious to toil and who has the 
opportunity to labor. What people get for nothing they do not always 
appreciate. As God became subject to man in the flesh, so in preaching 
this Gospel, in going about as Jesus did, doing good, we are serving, 
we are knowing that Christ lives, and that he is not far removed from us. 
I repeat, if we want to have a foretaste of heaven, if we do not want 
to wait until the millennium before we walk in the Garden of Eden, let 
us give liberally of our substance unto the poor. 

CHRIST THE AUTHOR OF EVERY GOOD AND PERFECT GIFT 

Christ is the source of all light. I do not believe there was ever an 
architect, a scholar, a surgeon, a painter, a builder, who did those won- 
derful things without the spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ. We may 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 



127 



refuse to acknowledge it, but nevertheless it is true, for Christ is the 
author of every good and perfect gift that cometh from above. 

Our Church educational system, the Brigham Young University, 
and all our institutes and seminaries presided over by devoted men and 
noble scholars, are doing, I am fully persuaded, a great work in pre- 
paring young men and women to preach the Gospel, and in fitting them 
to face the problems of life. 

Jesus said : "Peace I leave with you ; my peace I give unto you ; not 
as the world giveth," but the peace that makes for godly contentment. 
And brethren and sisters, this world will never know true and lasting 
peace until righteousness goes before peace, for there can be no enduring 
peace without righteousness. Righteousness exalteth a nation, but sin 
is a reproach to any people. 

THE RESURRECTED LORD 

Another promise : "Because I live ye shall live also." Oh, the sweet 
comfort this promise gives, I know that my Redeemer lives. And 
because he lives I shall live, my personality shall survive. I like to 
think of Christ immortal and resurrected in glory. I like to think of 
him as he moved among men upon the earth. I do not believe we change 
much in the way of rendering service when we go to the other world. 
Jesus, after he was resurrected, used the hands that made the world, to 
prepare food for his disciples, and when the resurrected Lord came to 
this glorious western hemisphere, he called for the halt and the blind, 
the maimed, the deaf, the sick and with those heavenly hands he touched 
their infirmities (which he had borne in mortality) and he healed them. 

I see crowded around him those beautiful children, not afraid of the 
Almighty, the little girls smiling into his face, the boys going up to him 
unafraid. And upon them he laid his hands and blessed them, and behold, 
as he knelt on the ground he "groaned within himself," for he was 
"troubled because of the wickedness of the people of the house of Israel." 

Now I do not think that when we get to the other world tears are 
going to cease to flow nor trouble cease to enter our hearts, for the 
Prophet Joseph said that our loved ones are not far from us, and they 
are cognizant of what we are doing, and some of our actions grieve 
them. I see the Savior praying, sympathizing with the multitude as he 
did in mortality. He fed the hungry, he listened to the complaints of the 
poor. Remember he said to the people : "The poor ye have always with 
you." 

The spirit of Christ is in this Welfare movement. It is going to 
lead us upward to higher and still higher spiritual heights, for Jesus is 
behind it. "Holy art Thou, Lord God Almighty." Amen. 



The Choir sang an anthem, "Hear My Supplication." 



128 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday, April 9 Third Day 

ELDER ANTOINE R. IVINS 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

My brethren and sisters, I came very nearly believing that this 
was going to be for me a day of "passover," and, had it been such, I would 
not have been at all worried. The only thing about it was that I had no 
mark on the door to know that it was going to happen. 

I have been more than pleased with the spirit of this conference, 
for I feel that every April Conference that we have should be a 
testimony to our Lord Jesus Christ. We are the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints. Our lives and our words should both be 
testimonies unto the world of the divinity of this organization, of the 
divinity of the Man, if you will permit me to call him a man, who 
caused it to come into existence. 

If I could spend my days and could convert the world to that 
thought, or just a man or two in the world, I would feel that my life had 
been a most successful one. 

A NEW WITNESS FOE GOD 

We have heard here some things incident to the life and the activities 
of our Savior. We have been told of them in the Bible, almost entirely 
in the New Testament. There are some prophetic utterances in the Old 
Testament, but we get most of our knowledge of Christ from the New 
Testament and from the Book of Mormon. We call the Book of 
Mormon — and rightly so — a "new witness for God," because it came 
along to corroborate and bear out the story of the writers of the New 
Testament. Now, in order that the Book of Mormon shall be a new 
witness for God, I think we must first believe in the Book of Mormon. 
In order to believe in the Book of Mormon we have to believe in the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, to accept his testimony that he saw God and 
Jesus Christ, and that he was commissioned by divine interposition to 
restore to the world the Book of Mormon. 

ARE REASON AND STUDY SUFFICIENT? 

Where are we going to get that testimony? Can we reason our- 
selves into it by studying the few prophetic utterances of the Prophet 
Joseph Smith that have already come to pass ? Can we get it by reading 
the testimony of the witnesses on the fly-pages of the Book of Mormon ? 
Can we get it by studying the archaeology of America and reasoning 
from that point of view that the Book of Mormon tells a true story, 
and that consequently the Prophet Joseph Smith was a true prophet ? 

From some source we must get this testimony, in order that the 
Book of Mormon may be for us a new witness for God. 

I cannot remember a time in my life when I have very seriously 
wondered if the Prophet Joseph Smith were commissioned of God. I 
grew up with that faith in my heart that he actually, in vision, saw God 
and Jesus Christ, the Angel Moroni, and other heavenly beings, and 
with that testimony more or less inherent within me, I have never 



ELDER ANTOINE R. IVINS 



129 



doubted the veracity of the Book of Mormon. As I grow older I like 
to dig into the archaeology and the enthnology of America somewhat, 
mainly with a view of getting things to tell other people that might help 
them along this line. But I find that there is in the minds of people who 
have studied these things such great confusion that you can hardly bring 
any uniform interpretation out of their studies and their reports. One 
man reads the inscriptions on the ruins of Mexico as far as he can, or 
looks at them and tries to interpret them. Another man does exactly 
the same thing, and they write quite divergent reports about them. 
What good is it then as a testimony to the Book of Mormon? 

A SURE WAY 

There is, however, to me, and I believe there should be to you, a sure 
way of getting at that question. There is a promise in the Book of 
Mormon that if we will read it with a prayerful heart God will tell us 
whether it is true or not. I have often wondered in my mind just why 
God saw fit to do that most wonderful thing which he did in preserving 
and bringing to light the Book of Mormon. It tells us many interesting 
things about a people that lived on this continent, and it tells us above 
all others of the visit of Christ to that people, and the more I study 
it the more I believe that the purpose God had in mind was to bring 
that new witness of Christ to light. 

THE PRINCIPAL PURPOSE OF THE BOOK OF MORMON 

I think the preservation of the history of that people was purely 
a secondary matter, perhaps, but that the real purpose was to testify anew 
to the life of Christ and his mission in the earth, and to clarify the 
doctrines that he gave us. And I find that by reading it through and 
studying it from that point of view, rather than one of history, I do 
have a feeling and a testimony when I get through with the book that 
it is divine. There is a spirit in it, there is a whispering to your soul, 
that an honest man cannot deny. 

That to me is the value of the Book of Mormon. 

Now, if we could go into Mexico and Central America and South 
America, and into our own United States, and, by scraping aside the 
earth which has accumulated over a few centuries, expose to view a 
consecutive and true story of this people which would bear out in all its 
major details the story of the Book of Mormon, what a simple thing 
it would be. But it would lose, in my mind, one of its greatest values. 

THE IMPORTANCE OF FAITH 

We are blessed as much, if not more, by the acceptance of certain 
things on faith than to accept them on reason. Whenever we can reason 
ourselves into a thing we get a certain satisfaction out of it, it is true, 
but whenever through faith we can accept the life of Jesus Christ our 
Lord and Master, we get a development that no amount of reason can 
ever bring to us. 

I believe that God purposely covered up these things that when

not one necessarily of investigation and discovery, except in so far as 
we can discover the spirit of God speaking to the hearts of men. I pray 
that he will bless us with his spirit, that as the days go on and grow into 
years, and as the years pass and we grow toward the end of our lives, 
that we may realize that we have done our best to live honorable, upright 
lives, to be a credit to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 
to be a living testimony of the work that was established under Jesus 
Christ. God grant it. Amen. 

ELDER RUFUS K. HARDY 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

For the unbeliever and the skeptic I imagine I have a panacea. I 
think were he permitted to sit where I have been sitting for these few 
days looking into your countenances, he would in very deed believe on 
the Lord Jesus Christ. I do not think it is possible that the light, the 
intelligence, and that spirit which emanates from an audience such as 
this can carry other than conviction even to the heart of one who is a 
firm unbeliever. 

God has given to this people so many blessed things that your faces 
just speak them out loud. It has been said that our life here is but a 
shadow of the life from whence we came, and that in the future death 
will be but a shadow of the life which we personally know and com- 
prehend while we are living. 

THE BOOK OF MORMON PRAISED 

God in his mercy and goodness has granted to us all this knowledge 
and all this understanding. I rejoice beyond my ability to express myself 
at the things which have just been spoken by Brother Ivins. I believe 
there is no other book that can be profitably studied by the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints particularly, and by the world in 
general, that would do as much good and bring the same conviction to 
the hearts of the people of this great world of ours, as the Book of 
Mormon. 

At least fifteen hundred years ago there was penned by the hand 
of one with whom we became acquainted later on, a record which was 
hid up and which contained the words of our Lord and Savior Jesus 
Christ. I think those words would intrigue anyone, and the things which 
are written in this great and marvelous book — history, adventure, all 
that one could desire even for young children — the glamor and the charm 
of it would take them far. 

Moroni, the man who hid up the record of these things, appeared 
to Joseph Smith, September 21, 1823. Later he appeared time after 
time and brought this sacred record with the careful statement that it 
must be correctly, accurately, definitely, positively translated, according 
to the will and promise of God. Afterwards' through holy messengers, 



132 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday, April 9 Third Day 

came the declaration that it had been translated correctly and that it 
contained the fulness of the everlasting Gospel. 

I have written just a verse or two from this book, and I shall ask 
you to bear with me while I read them. Think and ponder upon what 
is said : 

And again, my beloved brethren, I would speak unto you concerning 
hope. How is it that ye can attain unto faith, save ye shall have hope ? 

And what is it that ye shall hope for? Behold I say unto you 
that ye shall have hope through the atonement of Christ and the power 
of his resurrection, to be raised unto life eternal, and this because of 
your faith in him according to the promise. 

Wherefore, if a man have faith he must needs have hope; for without 
faith there cannot be any hope. 

And again, behold I say unto you that he cannot have faith and hope, 
save he shall be meek and lowly of heart. (Moroni 7:40-43.) 

And so I ask you, do you know a people anywhere who are meek 
and lowly of heart? I think I do. I think I know they are meek and 
lowly of heart because of their adherence to the principles which God 
in his mercy gave in purity to the Prophet Joseph Smith. 



HOME MISSIONARY WORK 

Your sons and daughters are preaching the Gospel in every land 
and clime. And then, I would remind you that you have husbands 
and sons and daughters here at home who are engaged in the most 
magnificent missionary work that they can perform. In the one hun- 
dred and twenty-seven stakes there were two thousand laboring during 
the past year. God did not forget them. Approximately eighteen 
hundred souls were brought to a knowledge of the truth, and many 
hundreds of lukewarm and indifferent members were brought back into 
a state of activity. 

In the month of February of this year, the shortest month, there 
were two hundred and seven baptisms in the stakes, and over four 
hundred inactive members of the Church were brought into activity. 
All this bears a great testimony to the faithfulness of the missionaries. 
They were strengthened in their testimonies. 

This work was accomplished through the local stake missions last 
year at an expense of only $2.18 per baptism. 

I hardly feel sometimes that it is proper to ask God to bless his 
Church because this is God's Church, but I do feel to ask him to bless 
us who are trying to carry on. May he make us strong, hold us up in 
our weakness, even to the time when we shall attain for ourselves that 
which we are seeking: eternal rest in the mansions on high, I humbly 
pray in Jesus' name. Amen.

ELDER FRANK EVANS 

President of the Eastern States Mission 

I realize that one who is called here is greatly favored, and yet that 
favor is not given to him because of himself, but because of the fact that 
he is engaged in the humblest of service. 

If I were to ask the members of the Church in the Eastern States 
Mission as to what would be their choice in a religious, or church, ex- 
perience, I feel sure that most of them would say : "The privilege of at- 
tending a General Conference of the Church." 

It is true they have many privileges there. Within a few weeks 
many of those within a radius of fifty miles of Harmony will gather on 
the banks of the Susquehanna to engage in a _baptismal service at the 
point where Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery were baptized, and will 
also celebrate the restoration of the Priesthood. 

A little later in the summer many will visit the Hill Cumorah and 
the Sacred Grove, and the home of the Prophet. They will go to the 
little old farm, the cradle of the Church, the place where six young men 
performed the necessary service of organization — five farmers and one 
school master, the oldest only thirty, the youngest slightly over nineteen. 

I am glad that all of those places are much as they were a hundred 
years ago, and I hope they will remain so. There is no encroachment, to 
speak of, of population. They are still only humble places.. I wish they 
could have seen — all of them — one of the demonstrations here during 
this conference, and I refer to the Singing Mothers, -not as a musical 
demonstration, particularly, but as something far more than that. 

I think if there had been a student in this audience who was in- 
terested in human reactions and human behavior, he would have seen 
something very, very interesting. Fifteen hundred minds directed to a 
leader here, fifteen hundred spirits responding to every gesture of the 
leader in order that they might give forth their message. Was there one 
amongst them who thought she was surrendering some personal liberty 
or personal privilege by acting in that way ? 

it seems to me that here was an achievement in leadership ; but more 
than that, in the high art of following it was a triumph. I feel it was 
typical of the leadership in this Church, men who lead by persuasion, by 
long-suffering, by kindness and meekness, and by love unfeigned. 

I want to be a follower. There never was a great leader unless he 
had first learned to be a follower. There have been times when parents 
of young men and young women who were about to leave for the mis- 
sion field have asked me what their preparation should be, that is, what 
they should take with them. Now, after nearly two years of work in the 
mission field I am ready to say that I cannot answer that question in 
terms of material things alone, but most importantly of all, let them come 
to us with the Spirit of God in their hearts, with a willingness to be- 
lieve. "Be ye faithful and believing." 

If they bring with them humility and the willingness to believe then 
all else will be added' unto them. 
May God bless you. Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Thitd Day 



ELDER RULON S. HO WELLS 

Formerly President of the Brazilian Mission 

I had much less fear in the jungles of Brazil than I feel upon this 
occasion. I am indeed humble before such an awe-inspiring assemblage. 

This year marks the centennial of the Church's missionary work 
abroad. I am pleased to make a report of one of the latest, or perhaps 
the last, foreign mission opened up by the Church — the Brazilian Mission 
in South America. In 1930, through the efforts of a few missionaries 
sent out from Buenos Aires, Argentina, converts were baptized and a 
branch was established in a small town in the southern part of Brazil. 
In 1935, just four year? ago now, we were called to open the Brazilian 
Mission. Since that time, with the splendid cooperation of your mis- 
sionary sons, and the great leading spirit of the Lord which has been 
with us in that work, eight branches in that great country are now part 
of our Church. 

Inasmuch as this is the first report of this new mission, you might 
be interested in knowing that our work up until just recently has been 
carried on solely among the European colonists who have been settling 
Brazil for the past hundred years, more particularly among the German 
people. We have 'many stalwart members and fine friends among these 
people. 

Ours has been a pioneering work and in many of the villages and 
towns where the -missionaries have gone the name "Latter-day Saint" or 
''Mormon" had never been heard before. It didn't take the adversary 
very long to catch up and circulate the usual falsehoods. 

In one town three of our missionaries were mobbed and driven out, 
but fortunately sustained no personal injuries. Not long after that 
time, missionaries returned to this same town and were able to establish 
one of the finest primaries we have in the mission. At the last conference 
I attended there the hall where we have our meetings would not hold all 
the people. There were people in that town waiting for the truth and 
with the help of the Lord the power of Satan was stayed. Since then 
several have been baptized there in that same village and the work is 
going forward. 

While our work was carried on among these German-speaking 
people we were able to get the Book of Mormon translated into the 
Portuguese language, the common language of the great country of 
Brazil, and now many missionaries are engaged in proclaiming the re- 
stored Gospel in this language, and the work will go on even more rapidly. 

Through the translation of the Book of Mormon into the Portuguese 
language the way has been opened to nearly forty million Portuguese- 
speaking people who may hear the Gospel in their native tongue for the 
first time. Through the work of proclaiming the restored Gospel in the 
Portuguese language in Brazil, new evidences of the authenticity of the 
Book of Mormon are coming forth. 

Just recently in the upper region of the Amazon Basin hieroglyphics 



ELDER RULON S. HOWELLS 



135 



resembling some form of Egyptian scroll engravings have been found. 
The Brazilians are puzzled. They can't find any Egyptian relationship 
with Brazil's history. The development will be interesting to us as a 
people, I am sure. 

Brazil and the Brazilians are and have been friendly to the United 
States and we find very little difficulty in general in preaching the Gospel 
in that great country. We are a long way from headquarters here in 
Salt Lake City, and I would like to express gratitude and appreciation 
for the splendid cooperation and support received from the First Presi- 
dency and the General Authorities. We have felt their sustaining 
prayers and faith. 

This is a marvelous organization and system that we have here in 
this great Church. Without the spirit of the Lord and the sacrifices of 
humble people very little can be accomplished. You parents and relatives 
who are supporting missionaries are in very deed showing your love 
for the Gospel and your fellow men in enabling these young men and 
women to be messengers of light to a tired and weary world. 

In one of the large cities of Brazil recently a very well trained and 
educated man asked me why we didn't concentrate and send missionaries 
to the so-called heathen countries and nations as most other churches 
do. I told him that I thought perhaps the Lord was more dissatisfied 
with those generally who profess to follow him and those who bear his 
name than with those who do not profess to be such. He said, "I agree, 
and may your people succeed in such a great undertaking." 

It was my privilege to be traveling in far-off India a few years ago 
and going around with a native, a so-called heathen or non-Christian. 
I remarked on the large number of American automobiles used there 
by the natives. He replied rather philosophically, "If the American 
religion or religions would work as well as the American automobiles, 
we non-Christians would accept them as we do the automobiles." 

My testimony has been strengthened by witnessing how the Gospel 
of Jesus Christ actually works for the salvation of the soul in the daily 
lives of Latter-day Saints more universally than in any other form, 
creed, or symbol to be found upon the earth today. I feel there is a 
great future for the Gospel in Brazil and South America and that there 
are many souls who are waiting for the truth. 

I bear you my testimony to the divinity of this work and ask the 
Lord's blessings upon us, that we may so live that we will be an example 
of light and peace to the world'. I do so in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 



136 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

Sunday. April 9 Third Dag 

ELDER EL RAY L. CHRISTIANSEN 

President of the Texas Mission 

I was called up here, once before, five minutes before it was time to 
close. I have never bad any sickness in my life, never been to the hospital, 
I have never had a pain, but I do believe I know what it means to suffer. 

Brothers and sisters, I feel honored to have the privilege to represent 
here today the sixty-two hundred members of the Church in Texas 
and Louisiana, and the ninety-seven missionaries who are laboring there 
so valiantly for the work of the Lord. We have a great mission. 

I was going to read some statistics that I thought would interest 
you, but perhaps I will not have time. I would like to remind some of 
the brothers and sisters here, who are not aware of it, that our mission 
is larger than Utah, Idaho, Wyoming, and Nevada put together. We 
have twenty-three thousand square miles more than the combined area 
of the following states: Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massa- 
chusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, 
New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia, and Ohio. Some of 
the people have said, "Well, you must have it mighty nice to have a 
small mission so you can get around." I looked up these figures and 
Brother Rowan helped me find some of them. 

Texas has fifty-three thousand square miles more territory than 
France — Texas alone — and eighty-three thousand square miles more 
than Germany; and has two hundred and fifty-four counties. We are 
told that Russia is the only European country that has more territory 
than the State of Texas. 

Now, my brothers and sisters, I believe that these ninety-seven 
missionaries are helping to fulfill in a splendid way one of the greatest 
obligations that this Church has to the world. And I believe that one of 
our great responsibilities is to preach this Gospel to the world. Here 
we have been rejoicing in each other's presence in hearing the word of 
the Lord preached and in hearing this beautiful music rendered. I wish 
to commend those who have done it, and yet upon the hands of this 
people was given the responsibility of taking this very thing to the world. 
I know that we are doing a commendable job, but I believe that there 
are more that could become conscious of this great obligation that we have 
to the people of the world. 

"This is my work and my glory, to bring to pass the immortality and 
the eternal life of man." That doesn't mean just us. Everyone is entitled 
to this grand and glorious privilege of having the Gospel plan taught to 
him. 

The missionaries are well. I thank you for your sons and your 
daughters and for your husbands. We have some fine husbands there 
who are doing marvelous work. They have the true spirit with them, 
they have the fire of the Priesthood, they are magnifying that power, and 
the manifestations of healing and of testimony that they exhibit are 
inspiring indeed to all of us who work with them. They have more than 



ELDER EL RAY CHRISTIANSON 



137 



they can attend to. The day before I left we had gained. permission from 
the superintendent of the Houston City Schools, who is an attorney, 
to take our lecture on The Book of Mormon before the teachers and 
before the students of certain classes in those schools. They are friendly 
to us. We are happy that we are able to meet with them and to teach 
them the divinity of this great record that we have. " 

These missionaries have taken two hundred and seventy-nine souls 
into the waters of baptism during the year 1938. Two hundred of them 
were matured people, and today those two hundred — I have interviewed 
most of them — are rejoicing in the wonderful principles of the Gospel. 
I feel so happy. I feel like Alma did as recorded I believe in the 29th 
Chapter of Alma: 

O that I were an angel, and could have the wish of mine heart, that I 
might go forth and speak with the trump of God, with a voice to shake the 
earth, and cry repentance unto every people. 

A missionary says that his two years in the mission field are the 
happiest two years of his life. I wonder why. I used to think that was just 
a commonplace statement, but now I know the answer. During that period 
of service in the Lord's work they are living near unto him. They pray. 
They realize and recognize the need of prayer and the need of the 
Lord's help in their work. They are living clean lives. We don't have 
to admonish them, so far as I know, to live the Word of Wisdom. They 
do it — and why shouldn't they be happy when they prepare themselves 
and qualify themselves to have this great blessing that the Lord has 
promised to those who are faithful. 

I have been thinking, all through this conference, why is it that we 
Latter-day Saints who know this thing to be genuine, who know that 
Joseph Smith was a prophet of God, why is it that we have to be told 
more than once to obey the principles that are presented to us here in 
every conference and in every stake conference ? Surely we could be 
valiant ; we could be courageous ; and rise to the occasion and live these 
wonderful principles so that we can inherit the blessing that God has 
given. 

I am taking somebody else's time. 

I ask for the blessings of the Lord upon you people here at home. 
I wish you knew how much you can help us by living this Gospel and 
meeting other people, as you should, when they come to visit you. 
Nearly a half million people visit here in the stakes of Zion each year, and 
they come back there with fine reports for the most part. But I tell you 
they come out here to learn about us and to see what they can see ; and if 
you can prove by your good works that Mormonism is what it is supposed 
to be, that is going to give us one of the greatest lifts that you can 
give us in the mission field. 

I know that this is the work of the Lord. I know that he will bless 
us when we qualify for his blessings. God bless you all, in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Third Day 



ELDER PHILEMON M. KELLY 

Formerly President of the Swiss-German Mission 

My beloved brethren and sisters and friends of the Church, I am 
very desirous of giving just a brief report of existing conditions in the 
German-speaking missions. I have presided over all three of these 
missions, having had the privilege of organizing the West German 
Mission. 

We have in these missions approximately fifteen thousand souls. I 
wish to report to you good people that they are among the most devoted 
members of the Church at the present hour. They are strong in paying 
their tithes and offerings. They are very devoted unto the authorities 
of the Church, and they literally worship our President. 

I have also had the privilege, in connection with my good wife, of 
visiting the Holy Land. Among other things we saw some of the 
mountains on which the ancient Prophet Elijah stood. You will re- 
member at one time he went to the mountain of Horeb, and as he stood 
upon the mountain top the voice of the Lord commanded him to stand 
and observe. "And a great and strong wind came and rent the moun- 
tains, and it broke the rocks before the Lord, but the Lord was not in 
the wind ; and after the wind an earthquake, but the Lord was not in 
the earthquake ; and after the earthquake a fire, but the Lord was not 
in the fire. And after the fire a still, small voice. And so it was when 
Elijah heard it he wrapped his face in his mantle." 

I wish to bear testimony that I, too, have felt the presence of the 
still, small voice while in the mission field. I am going to take the privi- 
lege of just giving one illustration. 

In 1937 President Grant and his party visited us in Germany and 
Switzerland. In Basel, Switzerland, he honored us by remaining as 
our guest in the mission home. Early one Sunday morning twenty-six 
lady members from the Basel branch came to the mission home. They 
were dressed in white. As President Grant descended the stairs to come 
into the reception room the girls began singing, "We Thank Thee O 
God for a Prophet." In President Grant's party there were various 
mission presidents. There was such a sweet spirit of peace and love 
and affection for the Prophet of the Lord surrounding us. Only those 
who were present could understand. We all bowed our heads in worship. 
Some of the brethren from other missions not only bowed their heads 
in worship but wept tears of joy and appreciation at having felt the 
presence of the Lord and knowing that the Prophet of the Lord was in 
our midst. 

The German and Swiss people honor and love President Grant. 
There could be no request made by him but what they would, to a hun- 
dred percent, follow out that desire. 

I bear testimony unto you that those people themselves do not 
want war. War is from a different source than from the people. Those 



ELDER W. AIRD MACDONALD 



139 



people are a devoted people ; they love life ; they love liberty ; they love 
the pursuit of happiness. They are devoted members of the Church. 

They requested when we left for home : "Just simply tell the truth 
about us as a people." 

May God make our hearts in attune with those things that are real. 
May we overcome false propaganda, and may we serve God in truth 
and keep his commandments, I pray most humbly in Jesus' name, Amen. 

ELDER W. AIRD MACDONALD 

President of the California Mission 

Someone has said that in every group or gathering will be found 
someone to say a good word for California. We barely made it today. 

I am honored to bring to you the greetings of one hundred and 
twenty-three missionaries and nearly eleven thousand Saints in the great 
California Mission. The Gospel of Jesus Christ is being carried for- 
ward and the Church is being planted all over that goodly land. There 
are fifty-five organized branches of the Church, whe.re the Saints are 
being taught the Gospel and are keeping the commandments of God. 

We are happy to report to you that in their tithes and offerings they 
are keeping pace with the stakes of Zion. I echo the testimony of the 
truth of the Book of Mormon, as given by President Ivins and President 
Hardy, and say to you that out there in that mission nearly seventeen 
thousand copies of that sacred record have been distributed during the 
past year. We believe the Lord intended that this book should be read 
by the world, for he sent the Angel Moroni fifteen times to this planet 
to see that it was properly printed, that the world might be taught that 
Jesus is the Christ ; and unless we, as a people, see to it that this sacred 
record is distributed among his confused children on the earth, they will 
not be sure that Jesus is the Christ. For they all read the selfsame Bible 
and are going in hundreds of different ways, evidencing their confusion. 
So I believe that the Book of Mormon is the means the Lord has given 
us as a new witness for God and that Jesus is the Christ. 

May we as a people rise to this great responsibility and carry for- 
ward our work. I bear testimony to you that it is the truth and pray 
God to bless us all in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER A. LORENZO ANDERSON 

President of the Mexican Mission 

Brethren and sisters, I am sure that President Christiansen is not 
the only one who has been suffering the last few minutes ; I did not know 
that President Grant ever ran a meeting fifteen minutes overtime. I 
appreciate the compliment he has paid to us mission presidents, in allow- 
ing these few minutes to those of us who have not had the opportunity 
of reporting to you. 

Running through my mind all during this Conference have been 
these words of the Savior : 




GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Third Dag 



Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, 
or figs of thistles? 

Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit ; but a corrupt tree 
bringeth forth evil fruit. 

A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree 
bring forth good fruit. 

Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast 
into the fire. 

Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them. (Matt. 7:16-20). 

I am sure that anyone who can see the fruits of Mormonism today 
cannot help but agree with us that the tree is good. 
I have rejoiced greatly in this conference. 

We are having wonderful success in the Mexican Mission. As I 
reported to you six months ago, we are limited to one lone stake to fur- 
nish the missionaries who may serve in the Mexican Mission. I believe 
that Mexico is the only nation in all the world which requires of its minis- 
ters that they be native-born citizens of the country before they are al- 
lowed to preach the Gospel ; therefore we are very much alarmed. I said to 
one of the bishops of the Juarez Stake yesterday : "If you have any more 
sixty-six year old men who can come into the mission field and do like 
one of the missionaries of that age who is now working in the Mexican 
Mission, send them along." 

When this brother arrived in the mission field, Sister Anderson said : 
"Please do not send him out into the country to work with the rest of 
the boys, keep him here in the city where I can look after him. He is too 
old to go out and preach the Gospel." 

He was quite offended when I told him that Sister Anderson wanted • 
to keep him under her wing. He said : "I can take it along with any of the 
boys." 

I appreciate the leadership we have in the Church today and the ex- 
cellent spirit that exists, and I do know that we have the authority of 
God to preach his Gospel here in the world. May he bless us and help 
us at all times, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



I know we can stand a selection by the choir, and inasmuch as 
we are to have "The Hallelujah Chorus" from "The Messiah," by the 
choir, I am prolonging the meeting a little. I know that you will wait 
to hear this selection. 



I rejoice in the remarkable and splendid Conference we have had. 
It has been a source of sorrow to me to be absent part of the time. I am 
feeling fine, physically. Speaking of old age, Brother Charles W. Pen- 
rose lacked only a few weeks of being seventy-five when he came to 
Liverpool to preside over the European and British Missions, and he per- 
formed — at least the missionaries did during his administration — many 
more baptisms than did Francis M. Lyman and Heber J. Grant. Brother 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



REGARDING AGE 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



141 



Penrose was there three years, and we had five years. So you must not 
think that age counts when it comes to spreading the Gospel. If they 
have the root of the matter in them and are healthy, just let them go out 
and work. 

BECAUSE WE HAVE THE TRUTH 

I thank the Lord for this remarkable and wonderful Conference we 
have had. No such conference could be held by any other people in all the 
wide world. Why is it that the Latter-day Saints have such a spirit with 
them ? Why is it that every missionary who fulfills a good mission says 
it is the best time of his life ? It is because we have the truth and they are 
nearer to the Lord when in the mission field than in any other place. 

May the blessings of the Lord be and abide with all of you. May 
you go home under the inspiration of the spirit that has been with us, 
first, last, and all time. 

I apologize to Brother Rulon S. Wells for not having him speak. 
Brother Wells, you know, is past eighty, and so am I. We had him speak 
to us in the temple, and then we asked him to speak again today, after the 
morning meeting, to the German Saints. 



The Choir sang "Hallelujah Chorus" from "The Messiah," (Han- 
del), after which the benediction was pronounced by Elder William R. 
Palmer, President of the Parowan Stake. 

Conference adjourned for six months. 

The musical exercises at the Thursday sessions were furnished by 
the Relief Society Singing Mothers, Wade N. Stephens, Conductor ; at 
the Friday sessions by the Nebo Stake Choir, J. D. Christensen, Con- 
ductor ; and at the Sunday sessions by the Salt Lake Tabernacle Choir, 
J. Spencer Cornwall, Conductor. The congregational singing was di- 
rected by J. Spencer Cornwall and Richard P. Condie. 

Accompaniments and interludes on the great organ were played by 
Frank W. Asper. 

Stenographic notes of the Conference were taken by Frank W 
Otterstrom and Joseph Anderson.

Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith 

Taken from his sermons and writings as they are found in the Documentary 
History and other publications of the Church and written or published in 
the days of the Prophet's ministry 

Selected and arranged by the Historian, Joseph Fielding Smith, and his 
Assistants in the Historian's Office of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints. 

Many of these discourses and writings appear in the Documentary 
History of the Church, but others have not been included in these volumes, 
but are scattered through the early publications of the Church. It has 
been difficult even for the student to obtain these because the old publica- 
tions, are not accessible for general use. 

In accordance with the many calls that have been made that there 
be a more extensive compilation of these discourses and sayings, the 
matter was taken up in the Historian's Office and such a compilation has 
been prepared, submitted to the First Presidency and passed by them for 
publication.

LIFE OF JOSEPH F. SMITH 

Sixth President 
of 

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 
By 

JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 

From the day of his birth until the day of his passing — four score 
years — there was scarcely a day that was not filled with intense and in- 
teresting activity. He commenced life in the midst of tribulation and 
dark persecution, and through the greater part of his life he was called 
upon to face the spirit of hate and wickedness, to a degree almost beyond 
human endurance. 

This volume dedicated to a man among men with the faith of the 
prophets of old. Its worth in your library is incomprehensible and its pres- 
ence, when read, will give words of wisdom and words of courage.

A THRILLING STORY 

of Century One of 

CHURCH HISTORY 

ERE is a new story of "Mormonism," told with a com- 
pleteness and charm that will thrill Latter-day Saints 
with a pride of achievement and at the same time 
win the admiration of the critic, be he friend or foe. In a 
COMPREHENSIVE HISTORY OF THE CHURCH, B. H. 
Roberts has done a masterful piece of research and has set 
down the record of Century One — 1830 to 1930 — in a bril- 
liant appraisal of momentous events. The reader with a 
sentimental interest will be fascinated with this narrative 
of truth stranger than fiction; the reader who approaches 
the new work with the critical vision of the historian will 
find it fair in statement, authentic in fact, copious in detail 
and sound in judgment. 

A COMPREHENSIVE HISTORY OF THE CHURCH was 
written by Elder Roberts at the instance of the First Presi- 
dency of the Church, with a commission to make it exhaus- 
tively complete, from the remotest beginnings to the close 
of the Centennial Conference of April 6, 1930. The final 
volume ends with an account of the Conference itself, mak- 
ing the history technically inclusive of all that happened in 
Century One of the organized existence of the Church. Thus 
it is a fitting commemoration of one hundred years of strug- 
gle and achievement. 

This monumental work is not to be confused with any former 
history, journal or chronicle. Though its nucleus is the his- 
tory of "Mormonism" published a few years ago in 
AMERICANA, running serially for six years through that 
magazine, yet this History is NEW — new in its wealth of 
material, new in method of treatment and new in its physical 
representation of the book maker's art.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



FIRST DAY 
MORNING MEETING 

The first session of the One Hundred and Eighth Semi-Annual 
Conference was held Friday morning, October 1, 1937, at 10 o'clock. 
The great Tabernacle auditorium and galleries were filled with people 
who had assembled from the Stakes and Missions of the Church. 

The Relief Society Singing Mothers, under the leadership of Sister 
Charlotte O. Sackett, furnished the music for this session of the Con- 
ference. 

President Heber J. Grant opened the Conference and announced 
that the Choir and congregation would sing "High on the Mountain Top." 

After the singing of this hymn, the invocation was offered by Elder 
Edward J. Wood, President of the Alberta Temple. 

The Relief Society Singing Mothers sang an anthem, "Lift Thine 
Eyes" (Mendelssohn). 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

It is a source of a great deal of pleasure to me to have the opportunity 
of meeting the Saints again in General Conference. 

REPORT OF EUROPEAN TOUR 

As you are all aware, since our last Conference it has fallen to my 
lot to visit nearly all of our missions in Europe. We have had a very 
enjoyable time. Statistics are never interesting, but I feel that it is only 
fair to give you some information pertaining to our trip. 

We left Salt Lake City, Sunday, June 13th, 1937, and sailed from 
Quebec on the 16th. Our party consisting of Hugh B. Brown, Joseph 
Anderson, and myself, arrived in Cherbourg, France, June 23rd, where 
we were met by President Richard R. Lyman of the European Mission, 
and President O. F. Ursenbach of the French Mission. We went direct 
to Paris, where I delivered a talk before the American Club in that city. 
This talk was received very favorably and nearly all of it was published in 
the Paris edition of the New York Herald 

After our visit in Paris we went to Liege, Belgium, a part of the 
French Mission, at which place we visited three Sunday Schools, also 
held a meeting in Herstal, near Liege, where I dedicated a new building ; 
and in the evening we held a meeting in Liege. The attendance at each 
of these meetings was very good indeed ; in fact at nearly every meeting 
we held the attendance was in excess of what we expected it to be, and 
upon more than one occasion over one-half of all the people in our 
audience were non-members of the Church. 

PROFITABLE MEETINGS IN SWITZERLAND 

We held a meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, on June 30th, one on 
July 1st in Neuchatel, Switzerland. The branches in all these places,

that is, at Liege, Geneva, and Neuchatel, are a part of the French 
Mission. From Neuchatel President Ursenbach returned to headquarters 
in Liege, and President Philemon M. Kelly of the Swiss-German Mission 
met our party at Neuchatel, and accompanied us through the Swiss- 
German Mission. 

We held a meeting in Bern, at which there was a large attendance, 
as I remember it, over 400 people. The following day a brief meeting 
was held at Interlaken, as we were passing through that city to take a trip 
on the cog railroad to see the wonderful Alps. Never before at any 
time have I been able to get such a magnificent view of the Alps as 
I did on this occasion. The clouds disappeared just before we reached 
the highest point on the railroad, and we could see five or six of those 
great towering mountains, covered with snow. When we made the return 
trip the clouds covered the tops of the mountains, so that we were unable 
to see them. We were very grateful for that wonderful, magnificent 
sight, second only of course to the Grand Canyon of the Colorado. 

On July 4th meetings were held in the morning and in the after- 
noon at Basel. Three or four hundred people attended each of these 
meetings. Tuesday, July 6th, we held a meeting in Zurich, Switzerland, 
and there were also over 400 people, as I recall it, at this service 

CORDIAL RECEPTION IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA 

Services were held in Frankf urt-on-Main, Germany, and there were 
more than 900 people in attendance at this meeting. This was the 
last meeting that we held in the Swiss-German Mission. From Frank 
furt we went to Prague, Czechoslovakia, by way of Nuremburg, at 
which latter place we were met by President Wallace F. Toronto, and 
we held a meeting with the Saints and friends in Prague. The hall in 
which we held the meeting was crowded, and many people were standing 
up during the entire session. While in Prague we visited the buildings 
that have been erected in that city for the benefit of feeble-minded chil- 
dren, those who are under-nourished, and the old people, and it was the 
most wonderful exhibit of fine, modern buildings and efficient work 
along the line of taking care of the unfortunate that I have ever had the 
privilege of visiting. The lady in charge spent three or four hours with 
us in visiting all of the places of interest there. These homes are named 
after the first president of the Republic, Mr. Masaryk. We were 
received in a very cordial way by the officials of the Republic and they 
expressed regret that the President of the Republic was absent, also 
that President Masaryk, the founder of the Republic at the conclusion 
of the great World War, was away. 

LIBERTY IN GERMANY 

On the following day, July 10, in company with President Toronto 
and wife we left for Dresden, Germany, where we held a fine meeting, 
with over 600 people in attendance." Here we met Elder Roy A. Welker, 
the president of the German-Austrian Mission, who, by the way, has

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



filled a most satisfactory mission, following the very successful presidency 
of Elder Oliver H. Budge, of Cache Valley. 

On July 14th we held a meeting in Breslau, and from Breslau we 
went to Berlin, in which latter city we visited three Sunday Schools, and 
in the evening held a meeting in a large auditorium, where there were 
over 1,100 people present, and some of them stood up during the entire 
session. We were assured that over two-thirds of that audience were 
non-members of the Church. 

One thing that was very pleasing to us was that we had perfect 
liberty in the holding of our meetings in Germany, notwithstanding the 
fact that more than thirty different denominations have been prohibited 
from preaching there. 

I thought it was very remarkable that we should have the privilege 
of holding meetings with the people of Germany. 

I learned that upon one occasion our Elders were prevented by 
the officials from preaching at a meeting. The officials said: "You 
have no right here, you must not preach." 

The Elders said: "We have not been prohibited from holding 
meetings and preaching." 

The officers said: "We know better. You will have to stop and 
we will bring you the evidence that you are not permitted to preach." 

They came back and said: "We could not find the word Mormon 
nor the name The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on the 
prohibited list." 

From Berlin our party went to London. Brother Richard R. 
Lyman was with us until the time when we reached Dresden, but as 
he was advertised to deliver a speech in London on World Peace, he 
returned to London and was not with us at the meetings held in Dresden, 
Breslau and Berlin. The various Mission Presidents were with us at 
the meetings held in their particular missions, namely : Presidents Kelly, 
Welker, Ursenbach, and Toronto, all of whom have made very fine 
records in presiding over the various missions on the Continent and have 
made friends of many leading officials in all of those countries, and 
stand well with them. 

BUILDINGS DEDICATED IN GREAT BRITAIN 

On July 20th we held a meeting in Liverpool, England, at which I 
dedicated a building that we have purchased there that is to be remodeled 
and used as a chapel. 

On July 21st we held a meeting in Burnley and I dedicated a Church 
building there. 

July 22nd we held a meeting in the Bradford Branch, and I dedicated 
the meeting house. At this meeting there were between 300 and 350 
people in attendance. They have a very nice Church building and quite 
a few of those who were present at the meeting were non-members of 
the Church. There was a very small percentage of non-members, how- 
ever, in comparison with other meetings that we held. 

Sunday, July 25, we held meetings in the London South and the 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT

London North Branches, and a Church building was dedicated in each 
of these places. We have a very nice, expensive dwelling in the South 
Branch, which has been remodeled to answer our purpose as a meeting 
place. In the North Branch we have a new chapel that we have erected 
that is very comfortable and answers our needs very well. 

On the 26th of July we visited Wales and held a meeting at Merthyr 
Tydfil, where a little Church building was dedicated. The attendance 
at this meeting was approximately 100 people. There are very few of 
our people in Merthyr Tydfil, but those we have there were very grateful 
to have a little meeting house of their own instead of renting a hall. 

CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION IN PRESTON AND ROCHDALE 

On July 30 our party visited Vauxhall Chapel in Preston, where 
Elder Heber C. Kimball and his associates delivered the first sermons 
that were preached in Great Britain in this dispensation. It was at that 
time that the Gospel was introduced in Great Britain. 

We visited the place where the Cock Pit was located, although it 
has now disappeared and there is merely a hole in the ground where 
the Cock Pit once stood. The same afternoon services were held near 
the River Ribble, where the first British converts were baptized. Really 
and truly, I feel a good deal like the old lady who had been attending Fast 
meetings for twenty or thirty years but had never had sufficient courage 
to bear her testimony. Finally one day she got up and bore her testimony 
and when she came home she said: "We had the finest Fast meeting 
today that I have ever attended." The question was asked: "Who 
spoke?" She answered: "I did." 

I feel a little that way myself. And I know that Brother Clark 
and I and the other speakers enjoyed talking to the Saints there as- 
sembled. We had really a spiritual feast upon that occasion, and there 
was no one who captured the audience more completely than did Sister 
Fox, the president of the Young Women's Mutual Improvement Asso- 
ciations of our Church. 

On July 31 we attended a baseball game between the Rochdale 
team consisting of Mormon missionaries and a Liverpool team. About 
3,000 people witnessed the game. The missionaries had a very easy 
time in winning over their opponents. Really it gave me a great thrill 
to watch the game. It took me back to my boyhood days when I played 
in the nine that won the championship of the Territory of Utah, and I 
have never played since. I decided to quit while my credit was good. 
It thrilled me to hear that audience cheering and shouting, "Saints! 
Saints! Saints!" 

I confess I was greatly pleased. It is a good thing to have a fine 
lot of boys playing ball and making friends. The people who were 
present were principally non-members of the Church 

On the evening of July 31st there was presented a very beautiful 
pageant by the missionaries and Saints in the Town Hall of Rochdale. 
More than 800 people were present and hundreds were turned away. I 
assure you that it was a very creditable pageant indeed, a beautiful pres-

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



entation. I was astonished at the splendid way in which the pageant 
was presented, considering the fact that those who participated did not 
have the time to have a rehearsal. 

There are about 6,000 people in the British Isles belonging to the 
Church, and there is many a stake- — in fact sometimes two stakes adjoin- 
ing each other, here at home, in which there would be more than twenty 
thousand people, who do not produce pageants that are better than 
was that one. It was a great credit to the people. 

There was such an appeal from those who could not get into the 
building to see the pageant that it was repeated Sunday night, although 
somewhat abbreviated. 

The meetings that were held in the Town Hall in Rochdale on 
Sunday were very wonderful indeed. The Lord was very good to all 
those who spoke. The speakers at these meetings, in addition to myself, 
were President Clark, Elder Richard R. Lyman, Elder Joseph J. Cannon, 
Elder Hugh B. Brown, Elders George D. Pyper and Arthur Winter, 
Sister Ruth May Fox and others. The same afternoon we dedicated 
a small chapel at Rochdale. 

On the following day, August 2nd, some auxiliary meetings were 

held. 

VISITS HOLLAND 

On August 7th we visited the Scout jamboree in Holland. The 
party consisted of myself, my daughter, Mrs. Lucy G. Cannon, Joseph 
J. Cannon and wife, Elder Richard R. Lyman, and Joseph Anderson. 
We left London on August 6th for Holland, and were met at Rotterdam 
by Brother Franklin J. Murdock who is the President of the Netherlands 
Mission. At the Scout jamboree we were very cordially received by 
Chief Scout Executive James E. West. Since returning home I have 
received a letter from Mr. West, expressing the deep appreciation of 
himself and associates for our having lent them, as they put it, part of 
the time of Brother Oscar A. Kirkham, who did a very fine work, and 
had an important position at the jamboree. 

Sunday, August 8, we held a meeting in Amsterdam, and in the 
evening of the same day held a meeting in Utrecht. On August 11th 
we held a meeting in Rotterdam. All of these meetings were very well 
attended, and among those present were many non-members of the 
Church. We subsequently authorized by telegrams signed by myself 
and Brother Richard R. Lyman, the sale of our mission headquarters 
in Rotterdam for 14,000 guilders, and the purchase of a building at the 
Hague for 12,000 guilders. Our new quarters are on a very fine resi- 
dential street, and the property cost something more than 40,000 guilders. 
The building is in a very fine state of repair. It was built by the Seventh 
Day Adventist Church and is a creditable place for our mission head- 
quarters in Holland, for which we are very grateful. 

Our party went from Rotterdam, Holland, to Hamburg, Germany, 
where we were met by Presidents Philemon M. Kelly, Thomas E. McKay 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT

and Alfred C. Rees. A meeting was held in Hamburg the night of 
August 13th, at which there were more than 600 people in attendance. 

EXPERIENCES IN SCANDINAVIA 

We held meetings in Esbjerg, Denmark, Sunday, August 13th, at 
which in the afternoon, the Esbjerg Branch's new Church building was 
dedicated. At all three of the meetings held in Esbjerg the attendance 
was large, particularly in the evening. . While in Denmark the party was 
accompanied by President Alma L. Petersen of the Danish Mission. 
Sister Clarissa Beesley joined us at Esbjerg, and accompanied us on our 
tour of the Scandinavian Missions. 

We held a meeting in Copenhagen, where there were nearly 500 in 
attendance. Brother Oscar A. Kirkham was also present at this meeting 
and at Stockholm. During our tour of the Swedish Mission we were 
accompanied by President Gustive O. Larson. 

The first meeting was held in Malmo on August 19, and there were 
between two and three hundred people in. attendance. Meetings were 
held in Stockholm Sunday, August 22, which were very well attended, 
nearly all present being our own people. There were between three 
and four hundred people present at each of these meetings. We then 
held a meeting in Goteberg, Sweden, where our party was met by Presi- 
dent A. Richard Petersen of the Norwegian Mission, who accompanied us 
on our tour of Norway. At the meeting held in Oslo, on August 26, there 
were nearly 500 people present. 

In Bergen on Sunday, August 29, we held two meetings, one in the 
morning and one in the evening, and at the evening meeting there were 
more than 600 people in attendance — fully two-thirds of those who were 
present being non-members of the Church. 

I am sure that there were in the building fully 100 people who could 
not get seats and they remained standing, as far as I could judge, without 
any of them going out during the entire service. After the close of the 
meeting the choir sang three very beautiful selections. One was par- 
ticularly beautiful; I cannot recall the name of it, but we all decided 
that the singing of it on this occasion was better and sweeter than we 
had ever heard it sung before. 

I am very pleased to tell you that Evan Stephens' anthems were sung 
in nearly all of the places we visited. They have been translated into 
the various languages and we enjoyed them very much, indeed. In one 
conference three of Brother Stephens' anthems were sung. I feel that 
we owe a very great debt of gratitude to men like Evan Stephens, George 
Careless, Ebenezer Beesley, Joseph J. Daynes, and others who have 
furnished us the music for our beautiful hymns. I rejoice in listening 
to these musical selections. 

Brother Joseph J. Cannon, who has just been released from the 
presidency of the British Mission, after having filled a very fine mission 
and was succeeded by Brother Hugh B. Brown at the time we left on 
this trip to visit Holland and the Scandinavian countries — to our aston- 
ishment was able to speak the Swedish language to the people, and 



8 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



they assured us that he spoke good Swedish. We thought this was very 
remarkable, seeing that it had been about 35 or 38 years since he first 
went there and filled a mission of nearly three years. 

We held a number of M. I. A. meetings in addition to the regular 
meetings, and I met with the missionaries many times in the different 
missions where only the missionaries and the mission presidents were 
present. 

The party returned by steamship from Bergen, Norway, to London 
by way of Newcastle, leaving Bergen August 30. The weather was all 
right but the ship rocked a little and I enjoyed lying in my bed during 
the trip from Bergen to Newcastle. 

We sailed for home on September 4, arriving here on Sunday, the 
12th — -just 13 weeks from the Sunday we left on our trip. 

IMPRESSED BY CHANGE IN ATTITUDE 

The thing that impressed me more profoundly on this mission than 
anything else was the marvelous change that has come about in the 
attitude of the people regarding the Latter-day Saints. When I was in 
Europe 30-odd years ago — -it will be 31 years on Christmas day since I 
returned — during my entire three years in the British Isles I never 
succeeded in getting a single solitary article published in the newspapers. 
Some of the vilest, most wicked, obscene, terrible things were published 
regarding us, but those in charge of the press positively refused to listen 
to anything we had to say 

I was assured while on this trip that we had favorable newspaper 
notices in Germany, Switzerland, Czechoslovakia, in Holland and in 
Belgium. No criticism of any kind or description, just fine notices 
regarding our meetings, and in some cases the notices in the papers in the 
British Isles were of such a character that if we had had the privilege 
of writing them ourselves we could not have written anything that 
would have pleased us better. As near as I could judge not a single article 
was written during our entire trip but what was intended to give a fair, 
honorable and splendid report of our people. I rejoice in these things. 
It is such a marvelous change from the spirit of animosity and almost 
hatred that I found among newspaper men that I came in contact with 
over thirty years ago 

As one illustration, I received a letter from the managing man of 
Ramsden and Company, way back in the early days before the White 
Star steamships were built — I have forgotten the name of the steamship 
line but the Ramsden people had entire charge of it — and Mr. Ramsden 
was one of the most loyal friends of our mission presidents that I think 
we ever had in any part of the world. 

STORY OF INTERVIEW WITH EDITOR 

I remember John Henry Smith telling me of a letter that President 
Joseph F. Smith wrote to Mr. Ramsden thanking him for his very 
splendid treatment while he presided over the European Mission. Mr. 



president heber j. grant 



9 



Ramsden said he would not sell that letter for a thousand dollars or more, 
that he prized it more than any other letter he had ever received. President 
Smith told Mr. Ramsden in this letter that the very wonderful treatment 
he had received from him and others was such that he dared not call 
on him to bid him goodby, but waited until he was on the steamship 
before doing so, as he was almost afraid that he might break down and 
make a baby of himself if he had called in person to thank him. 

The manager of Ramsden and Company gave me a letter of intro- 
duction to the editor of a London paper, and said he felt that the paper 
would publish anything I wanted published. When I reached the news- 
paper office I was told that the editor was out of town, but that his 
assistant, a Mr. Robinson, would receive me. The assistant asked me 
what I wanted, and I told him I would like very much to tell him the 
truth about our people, that what he had published was not true. 

"That is all right," he said, "we have published the right thing about 
you Mormons." 

"Well," I said, "when a man calls another man a liar, he naturally 
thinks that he has done the right thing of course, but that does not make 
him a liar. I know absolutely that everything you have published in 
your paper is a falsehood. I come to you with a letter from the firm 
that has done business with us for over fifty years, and that vouches 
not only for my honesty and integrity, but for the honesty and integrity 
of every man who has served as president of the British and European 
missions of the Church for fifty long years. I defy you to get a cer- 
tificate of character in favor of any one of the people who has furnished 
you the lies you have published in your paper." 

"Never mind, we do not propose to publish anything you say." 

I said : "Good-by. I have met your kind from London to Tokyo." ■ 

Thirty-odd years ago in England the way one dressed had quite 
an effect on people, and we had to wear "stovepipe" hats. When the boy 
who came downstairs to meet me told me that the editor was out, and that 
the assistant editor would receive me, that the assistant editor's name was 
Robinson, I thought to myself, after he dismisses me I will refer him to 
Phil Robinson. 

After the assistant editor had refused to grant my request, I stepped 
to the door, put on my two-story hat, and then turned around and took it 
off again and said: 

"By the way, as I remember it, the boy said that you are not the 
editor, that the editor was out, and you are only the assistant editor, 
and your name is Robinson. — Is your name Robinson ?" 

"Yes." 

I said, "Are you related to Phil Robinson ?" 
"No sir." ' 

"Do you know Phil Robinson?" 

"Do I know Phil Robinson? Everybody knows Phil Robinson." 
"Well, I am glad to know that. Is he editing the Society and Court 
Journal here in London?" 
"Yes."

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



"Was he the correspondent of the London Daily Telegraph, one of 
the two greatest [I emphasized "greatest" because his paper was not 
one of the greatest] London newspapers during the Boer War?" 

"He was." 

"Would you believe anything he said?" 

"Anything he said, fully." 

"One hundred cents on the dollar?" 

"Fully one hundred cents on the dollar," he answered. 

"All right. Buy his book entitled 'Sinners and Saints', it will cost 
you only a couple of shillings, and if you cannot afford the money I 
will buy it and give it to you. You will find that everything you have 
published in your paper is a falsehood." 

Phil Robinson came to Utah and he traveled from Cache Valley 
on the north clear down to Orderville and St. George and other places 
on the south, and wrote a book giving statistics and showing that eighty 
per cent of the population did not anywhere near furnish as many inmates 
of the city jail and the territorial penitentiary as the eighteen per cent who 
were not members of the Church. 

He said, "Why, you astonish me." 

I said, "Oh, you are not the only man who has been astonished 
when he has run up against the Mormon question." 
"Write me half a column." 

I said, "Thanks. Small favors thankfully received, large ones in 
proportion. Ten columns of lies, and a half column of refutation. You 
shall have it within a few hours." 

I sent it to him. He kept it the usual two or three months, and 
then sent it back with the usual printed slip which I have read many 
times: "The editor regrets that he cannot find space for the enclosed 
manuscript, which is returned." 

I never get one of those statements but I think of the humorous 
expression: "Polite lying is a gentlemanly accomplishment, lubricates 
business, varnishes unpleasant facts, promotes friendship." 

Instead of the editor's statement impressing me with his real sorrow, 
it impressed me with the fact that he was guilty of falsehood. 

Today we find the exact opposite, in that country, and in fact all 
over the United States. We are getting more favorable notices today 
on account of our Security Plan than we have ever had before, and I 
am sorry that we are getting more credit than we are entitled to have. 

IDLENESS NOT TO BE ENCOURAGED 

I took the trouble this morning to read in the Doctrine and Cove- 
nants regarding the idler, and we have some idlers in our midst. We 
find in Section 75 of the Doctrine and Covenants : 

Let every man be diligent in all things. And the idler shall not have 
place in the Church, except he repent and mend his ways. 

I referred yesterday to the people who were assembled in this 
building, and the Tabernacle was nearly as full (excepting the gallery)

of our good sisters yesterday as it is of people today. Let me tell you 
that where there is one idler among the sisters there are about twenty-five 
idlers among the brethren. I think that is about a fair average. 
In Section 88, we read : 

Cease to be idle; cease to be unclean; cease to find fault one with 
another ; cease to sleep longer than is needful ; retire to thy bed early, that 
ye may not be weary; arise early, that your bodies and your minds may- 
be invigorated. 

Please remember that these are not the statements of Heber J. 
Grant, but they are the statements of the Lord: 

And the inhabitants of Zion also shall remember their labors, inas- 
much as they are appointed to labor, in all faithfulness ; for the idler shall 
be had in remembrance before the Lord. 

Now I, the Lord, am not well pleased with the inhabitants of Zion, 
for there are idlers among them ; and their children are also growing up 
in wickedness ; they also seek not earnestly the riches of eternity, but their 
eyes are full of greediness. 

Thou shalt not be idle; for he that is idle shall not eat the bread 
nor wear the garments of the laborer. 

We now are trying to take care of the worthy poor, and in 
about eight cases out of ten the "worthy poor" who apply for help are 
not and have not been full, honest, conscientious tithepayers. 

Behold, they have been sent to preach my gospel among the congre- 
gations of the wicked ; wherefore, I give unto them a commandment, thus : 
Thou shalt not idle away thy time, neither shalt thou bury thy talent that 
it may not be knowa 

I want to tell you we found, by inquiry, that a great many of our 
missionaries were idling away their time, and we tried to encourage them 
to be more faithful. I heard a statement that I quoted here yesterday — 
I hope it is not true- — that a man who had often borrowed money from 
one of our country banks on a crop mortgage came to the bank and 
wanted some money. The banker said : "Certainly, we'll be glad to let 
you have some money. Just bring us a crop mortgage." 

"Ah," said he, "I am not raising any crops now. The government 
is giving me more money for not raising crops than I could get other- 
wise. I will give you an order on the government." 

Let us hope that that spirit of independence that was with our 
pioneer fathers may be re-awakened in us, and that none who are Latter- 
day Saints holding the Priesthood of God will be guilty of being idle. 
Let us work early and let us work late 

REVELATION TO HYRUM SMITH 

As I was looking for these passages that I have quoted, I thought 
of a very remarkable and wonderful revelation that was given, as I 
remember it, eleven months before the Church was organized, through 
the Prophet Joseph Smith to his brother Hyrum. It is a remarkable 
revelation :

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Behold, the field is white already to harvest ; therefore, whoso desireth 
to reap, let him. thrust in his sickle with his might and reap while the day 
lasts, that he may treasure up for his soul everlasting salvation in the 
kingdom of God. . . 

Seek not for riches but for wisdom, and behold the mysteries of God 
shall be unfolded unto you, and then shall you be made rich. Behold, he 
that hath eternal life is rich. 

Verily, verily, I say unto you, even as you desire of me so it shall be 
done unto you ; and, if you desire, you shall be the means of doing much 
good in this generation. 

Few men have ever lived that have done more good than Hyrum 
Smith in his generation, and he has left a posterity that is among the 
staunchest and most powerful in all the Church. One of the most 
splendid men that ever lived was his son the late President of this Church, 
Joseph F. Smith. 

Verily, verily, I say unto you, even as you desire of me so it shall 
be unto you ; and if you desire, you shall be the means of doing much good 
in this generation. 

That was the desire of Joseph F. Smith, and he did it. 

Say nothing but repentance unto this generation. Keep my command- 
ments, and assist to bring forth my work, according to my commandments, 
and you shall be blessed. 

* * * 

Behold, this is your work to keep my commandments, yea, with all 
your might, mind and strength. 

Seek not to declare my word, but first seek to obtain my word, and 
then shall your tongue be loosed ; then, if you desire, you shall have my 
Spirit and my word, yea the power of God unto the convincing of men. 

* * * 

Behold, I speak unto all who have good desires, and have thrust in 
their sickle to reap. 

Behold, I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God. I am the life and the 
light of the world. 

I am the same who came unto mine own and mine own received me not ; 

But verily, verily, I say unto you, that as many as receive me, to them 
will I give power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe 
on my name. 

My brethren and sisters, I am not reading to you my words, but 1 
am quoting to you the words of Jesus Christ our Redeemer and Savior. 
While upon this mission one thing that thrilled me was to read the book 
by Richard L. Evans giving a history of missionary work in Great 
Britain. Fifty thousand, as I remember it, of the staunchest, finest of 
all the people of Great Britain have helped to build this Church by 
emigrating to this country. A marvelous work. 

Wilford Woodruff baptized over 2,000 people, and Orson Pratt 
nearly the same number. Heber C. Kimball, Lorenzo Snow and others 
did marvelous and wonderful work there also. 

President Heber C. Kimball was inspired in the most marvelous 
and wonderful way in opening up that mission. I had great joy in 
contemplating these things.

THE EUROPEAN SAINTS TO HAVE MORE ATTENTION 

It melted my heart to find how anxious the people who are in those 
countries are to hear the Authorities of the Church, how their hearts 
swelled with gratitude when President Clark, myself, Brother Lyman 
and others were with them. I feel really and truly ashamed of myself 
that I have neglected so long returning to that part of the flock. They 
are just as much a part of this Church as you are, and the Lord helping 
us, they shall not be neglected in the future as much as they have been 
in the past. They are a part of the work of God, and they are entitled 
to visits every year or two from some of the leaders of this Church. We 
have taken care of our people here at home, and we have sadly neglected 
those fine people over in those countries. Pardon me, but I do feel in 
my heart condemned that I did not take the time to go back there sooner, 
and if the Lord spares my life I am not going to wait very long before 
going back again 

I think I have reasonably well covered the ground in reporting my 
mission to you. 

A FINANCIAL SAVIOR 

I want to say a little about a subject that so many Latter-day Saints 
say they are sick and tired of. Why are they sick and tired of it? Be- 
cause they are not doing their duty. No mortal man who is living the 
Word of Wisdom is ever sick and tired of hearing it preached. It would 
be the financial savior of the whole world if they were to live the Word 
of Wisdom. It would solve all their financial problems, there would not 
be, as I remember it, about 160,000,000,000 or 170,000,000,000 cigarets 
smoked in a single year — a soul- and body-destroying weed. 

I remember reading years ago (I had a number of statistics in a 
little book, which I regret I have lost), a statement to the effect that for 
fifty long years in Harvard no young man who smoked tobacco had ever 
graduated as the star student of his class, and yet there were five times 
as many boys smoking tobacco as there were who did not smoke. A 
soul-destroying and body-destroying weed. 

When I read in the newspaper a few days ago of the hundreds of 
thousands of dollars that we are taking in in our state through the sale 
of liquor, millions of dollars being wasted a year — worse than wasted' — 
I felt sad. Would you think much of a man who would set fire to millions 
of dollars worth of property? That is what is being done when we drink 
liquor and when our young people learn to smoke cigarets. Let each and 
every one of us fathers and mothers set an example of keeping the Word 
of Wisdom ; then there will be no reflection upon us if our children do 
not follow our example. Let us as a people change the law in this country 
and not let a lot of whiskey selling people direct us. Let us at least have 
prohibition in Utah. 

Think of the millions of dollars expended here in Utah alone for 
the use of liquor. There was not a tithe of the amount of liquor now 
consumed used when we had Prohibition. Millions of dollars of money 



14 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



was expended to bring back liquor. The whole United States has sur- 
rendered to the lies that were told to the effect that there was more 
drunkenness and more crime when we had Prohibition. No greater lies 
were ever published. 

THE WORD OF WISDOM 

The Word of Wisdom is what the Lord has to say, not what man 
has to say, and although an old subject, I propose to read the Word of 
Wisdom. This is what the Lord says, and not what Heber J. Grant says 
— don't forget it. Let each and every one of us try to improve our lives 
and inspire others to improve theirs. No man or woman who is keeping 
the Word of Wisdom finds fault with it. Why? Because they know 
of the health they enjoy, they know of the peace, the joy, the comfort, 
the satisfaction that come to their hearts when they do what the Lord 
wants them to do. 

Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet at Kirtland, Ohio, 
February 27, 1833 — 

— (over a hundred years ago) — 

— known as the Word of Wisdom. — Abstinence from wine, strong 
drinks enjoined — Moderation in the eating of meat — Wholesome foods — 
Promises to those who live according to these precepts. 

A Word of Wisdom, for the benefit of the council of high priests, 
assembled in Kirtland ; and the Church, and also the Saints in Zion — 
To be sent greeting; not by commandment or constraint — 

Some say, "Oh, that is how I get around it. It is not given by 
commandment or constraint." What is it? I will tell you what it is — 

but by revelation and the word of wisdom, showing forth the order 
and will of God — 

When the Lord shows forth his order and his will, do not try to 
sing lullabies to your conscience, any one of you who is breaking the 
Word of Wisdom. 

— in the temporal salvation of all Saints in the last days. 

It would be the temporal salvation of the people of all the wide 
world if they would live the Word of Wisdom. 

Given for a principle with promise, adapted to the capacity of the 
weak and the weakest of all Saints, who are or can be called Saints. 

Behold, verily, thus saith the Lord unto you : In consequence of evils 
and designs which do and will exist in the hearts of conspiring men in 
the last days, I have warned you and forewarn you, by giving unto you 
this word of wisdom by revelation — 

And can there be a more damnable design than advertisements show- 
ing the picture of a beautiful woman and by her a ring of tobacco smoke, 
supposed to be a wedding ring? A picture of a beautiful woman learning 
to smoke. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT

That inasmuch as any man drinketh wine or strong drink among you, 
behold it is not good, neither meet in the sight of your Father, only in 
assembling yourselves together to offer up your sacraments before him. 

And behold, this should be wine, yea, pure wine of the grape of the 
vine, of your own make. 

And again, strong drinks are not for the belly, but for the washing 
of your bodies. 

And again, tobacco is not for the body, neither for the belly, and 
is not good for man, but is an herb for bruises and all sick cattle, to be 
used with judgment and skill. 

And again, hot drinks are not for the body or belly. 

And again, verily I say unto you, all wholesome herbs God hath 
ordained for the constitution, nature, and use of man — 

Every herb in the season thereof, and every fruit in the season 
thereof ; all these to be used with prudence and thanksgiving. 

Yea, flesh also of beasts and of the fowls of the air, I, the Lord, 
have ordained for the use of man with thanksgiving ; neverthelss they are 
to be used sparingly. 

And it is pleasing unto me that they should not be used, only in times 
of winter, or of cold, or famine. 

All grain is ordained for the use of man and of beasts, to be the staff 
of life, not only for man but for the beasts of the field, and the fowls of 
heaven, and all wild animals that run or creep on the earth ; 

And these hath God made for the use of man only in times of famine 
and excess of hunger. 

All grain is good for the food of man ; as also the fruit of the vine ; 
that which yieldeth fruit, whether in the ground or above the ground — 

Nevertheless, wheat for man, and corn for the ox, and oats for the 
horse, and rye for the fowls and for swine, and for all beasts of the 
field, and barley for all useful animals, and for mild drinks, as also other 
grain. 

And all Saints who remember to keep and do these sayings, walking 
in obedience to the commandments, shall receive health in their navel and 
marrow to their bones ; 

What a wonderful promise from God ! 

And shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden 
treasures ; 

And shall run and not be weary, and shall walk and not faint. 
And I, the Lord, give unto them a promise, that the destroying angel 
shall pass by them, as the children of Israel, and not slay them. 

I believe as firmly as I believe that I am standing here before you 
today that, on three separate and distinct occasions in my life I would 
have lost my life had I not been an observer of the Word of Wisdom, 
but on account of the pure blood I had in my veins and the promise of 
God and the keeping of the commandments of God, my life has been 
spared. 

It is no hardship to me to eat meat sparingly. I lived for several 
years, during the winter time, in the Utah Hotel and I am sure that not 
more than ten or a dozen times did I order meat, and then it was some 
small lamb chops ; no pork, no turkey, no chicken, no veal of any kind did 
I ever eat during that time at the cafeteria.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



JOY IN BEARING TESTIMONY 

I rejoice in the remarkable health I enjoy. It has been the joy of 
my life to testify of the good things that come to every man and every 
woman who lives up to the commandments of the Lord. I thank the 
Lord beyond all the power with which he has endowed me to express 
my thoughts for this Word of Wisdom, the temporal salvation of this 
people, if we only keep it. 

I have had joy in my labors in the British Isles and on the Continent. 
It has been a real pleasure to me to bear my witness in all humility that 
I know that God lives ; that I know that he hears and answers our 
prayers ; that I know that Jesus Christ is the Son of the Living God, the 
Redeemer of mankind. I do know beyond a shadow of a doubt that 
Joseph Smith was a Prophet of the true and living God and that he was 
inspired and directed by our Heavenly Father and that he received reve- 
lations from God and from Jesus Christ. It was my joy to bear that 
testimony in all these lands that I have referred to. Not only has it been 
my joy to do this, but I thank the Lord that for fifty-odd long years I 
have been able to bear that testimony and that day by day and year by 
year there have come to me constantly evidences, so far as the intelligence 
with which God has endowed me is concerned, to confirm my knowledge 
of the truth of this Gospel of Jesus Christ which has come to us. 

With all my heart and soul, I pray God to help you and to help me 
and to help every one of the Latter-day Saints so to live that our lives 
will proclaim the Gospel ; that our lives may be the influence that will 
make a good impression. Many young men think that if they are "a hale 
fellow well met" ; that if the man that is employing them smokes and 
they smoke too he will think more of them. I tell you the day is here 
right now when many men will not employ a Mormon boy who is not 
living up to the teachings of his parents and observing the Word of 
Wisdom. 

SUCCESS FOLLOWS KEEPING OF COMMANDMENTS 

The keeping of the commandments of the Lord gives us success in 
the battle of life. The money expended for liquor and tobacco is the 
difference between a young man making a success in life and making 
a failure. 

I stood at the graves of two of my boyhood friends who lived long 
enough to be married and have children. Liquor had got the better of 
them and as I stood at their graves — one of them having been cut off the 
Church for having lost his virtue while under the influence of liquor — 
I pledged my best to fhe Lord as I looked up into heaven, to labor with 
all the power that God gave me to fight whiskey and tobacco and I have 
kept that pledge. 

I hope every Latter-day Saint within the sound of my voice today 
may make a pledge with God that he or she will not be an idler ; that he 
or she will keep the commandments of God ; that they may bring others 
to a knowledge of the truth, and this is my humble prayer, and I ask it 
jn humility and in the name of our Savior, Jesus Christ, Amen,

ELDER REED SMOOT 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

I do not know just how you feel after listening to the remarkable 
sermon just delivered by President Grant. I want to say to you today 
that from my own experience, not only at home but abroad as well, 
the statements made by the President, if carried out in our lives, would 
bring honor, not only to the individual members of the Church but to 
the great organization to which we belong. I am quite sure I speak 
the truth when I say I know that every member here is perfectly willing 
to sacrifice anything that the Church, through the inspiration that comes 
to God's servants, requires in order that it may grow and increase in 
power in the world. 

OBEDIENCE TO LAWS OF THE CHURCH BRINGS HONOR 

I just want to add one thing to what has already been so well said 
to show my brethren and sisters that the honest people of the world will 
think a great deal more of the members of this Church if they comply 
with its laws and live up to their professions as Latter-day Saints than 
if they do not. I have had many chances in my life to prove this. 

I remember upon one occasion, shortly after I went to the Senate 
of the United States, and after the wicked charges had been made 
against me, I was invited to a dinner by perhaps not only the wealthiest 
woman in Washington, but in the United States. She had a beautiful 
home, all that money could purchase. Upon that occasion as I entered 
that great dining room I saw tables that were at least eighty or ninety 
feet long, furnished of course with all that money could command, 
and at each plate were three glasses for the purpose of serving three 
different kinds of wine. As I sat at the table I thought to myself that 
the proper way to do was to turn my glasses upside down so that no wine 
could be served at the place where I sat. 

After the dinner was over, and we had adjourned into the great 
reception room, my hostess came to me and said : 

"Senator Smoot, wasn't my wine good enough for you?" 

I said : "No, madam, no wine is good enough for me. I never use it." 

I had the chance then and there to explain to her the Word of 
Wisdom, and I am glad to report to you that she admitted to me that 
we were right, and that all of them would be better without strong 
drinks. But fashion, that great slave-driver of certain classes, was 
so powerful that I suppose she would follow it even though she realized 
that to drink wine was wrong. 

DR. KARL G. MAESER's SAYINGS 

I thought this morning I would take the time to call the attention 
of this Conference to some of Doctor Karl G. Maeser's sayings, which 



18 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



I call Sentence Sermons. I think they are wonderful ; each one is a 
subject for a sermon, and put so concisely that to announce the statement 
itself is sufficient : 

Infidelity is consumption of the soul. 
Be yourself, but always your better self. 
The Lord is never in debt to any one. 
The Lord never does anything arbitrarily. 
Make the man within your living ideal. 
Everyone's life is an object lesson to others. 
My word shall always be as good as my bond. 
Authority must be as an iron fist in a velvet glove. 
Say to thy soul : "No unclean thing shall enter here." 
One who has lost the Spirit of the Lord is dead spiritually. 
Let your first good morning be to your Heavenly Father. " 
A man without character is like a ship without a rudder. 
I would rather lose my right arm than break my word of honor. 
If it shall please my Heavenly Father, I shall be a teacher in heaven. 
It is not so much what a person says, but what makes him say it. 
A laudable ambition to excel is an indispensable requisite to success. 
When I listen to a sermon, I have my ears open to the doctrine only. 
No man shall be more exacting of me or my conduct than I am of 
myself. 

He that deceives another is a knave; but he that deceives himself is 
a fool. 

Our patriarchal blessings are paragraphs from the book of our pos- 
sibilities. 

Boys, when you are tempted to go into a saloon, think of me, your 
teacher. 

We go to the East for learning, but the East will come to us for 
wisdom. 

No righteous rules, however rigid, are too stringent for me; I will 
live above them. 

Eagerness to earn bread and butter has overshadowed many a golden 
opportunity. 

School is a drill for the battle of life. If you fail in the drill you will 
fail in the battle. 

I would rather trust my child with a serpent than to place him in the 
hands of an irreligious teacher. 

The good angels never lose an opportunity of calling attention to 
something good in everybody. 

All our prayers are addressed in the handwriting of the heart, readable 
to God and ourselves only. 

Youth demands recreation, and if it is not provided in the high places, 
will seek it in low places. 

The truly educated man will always speak to the understanding of the 
most unlearned of his audience. 

If you learn only the fraction of the "A" of a principle, practice 
at once that fraction you have learned. 

What we did before we came here conditioned us here; what we do 
here will condition us in the world to come. 



ELDER REED SMOOT 



19 



It is our privilege to become so attached to our duties that temptation 
shall have no power to lead us astray. 

Every one of us, sooner or later, must stand at the forks of the 
road and choose between personal interest and some principle of right. 

CHANGE WROUGHT BY THE GOSPEL 

I have read these hundreds of times. I think if the Lord ever made 
a man completely over, through accepting the Gospel of Jesus Christ, 
that man was Doctor Karl G. Maeser. All his ideas of life were changed. 
I have heard him tell many and many a time, and personally I know from 
actual experience, of the spirit which I suppose is common to the German 
people, that of being strictly military, if you please, in the demands made 
by them. 

I remember the first time that I ever saw Brother Maeser. I was 
then a small boy, and I went to the Twentieth Ward school. He came 
to the Twentieth Ward after teaching President Young's children in a 
small schoolhouse within a block of this place. There was a blackboard 
painted on the wall on the west end of the room, and a long bench in 
front. We all sat upon that bench. Brother Maeser came down the 
aisle, walking just as I always imagined a German general would do. 
He stood in front of the class, then came up to me, as I was on the end 
of the bench, and said: 

"Are you prepared ?" 

I didn't know what "prepared" meant. I said, "No." 

He slapped my ears, and went all down that bench, and every one 
of the class got a slap on the ears. 

Years afterwards I saw Karl G. Maeser, under the influence of 
the Spirit of God. He had been called by the President of this Church 
to a great mission. I saw him, as I say, transformed from the German 
spirit into a man with the humblest spirit and with a devout belief 
in God's way. 

I owe a great deal to Brother Maeser. I graduated from the Brigham 
Young Academy, and I thank God that later I had a chance to demon- 
strate to him that I loved him — loved him better than he perhaps thought. 
I would have done anything in the world for him. He was a man of 
God who fulfilled his mission, and as the years go by the members of 
this Church, through the students that were under him, shall know better 
the work intended by God for his people in this dispensation. 

SERVICE is JOY 

My brethren and sisters, I believe in service to God. I believe in 
service to country. I believe in service to our families, and I believe 
in service to the Church. God grant that I may ever be able to fulfil 
every call, no matter what it may be. I assure you that there isn't a day 
passes but that I ask my Heavenly Father that I shall be blessed in a 
way that my life shall be acceptable to him, also for the welfare of my 
loved ones; the welfare of the President of the Church; the welfare 



20 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



of the Authorities of the Church — both the local and the general Au- 
thorities. I feel that way, my brethren and sisters. May we pass 
through the trying ordeals of the present with a deeper conviction in our 
souls that God is at the helm, I ask in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

ENCOURAGED AS TO SECURITY PROGRAM 

It has been my privilege during the last summer to be associated with 
the Church Security Committee, to meet and hold conversations with 
some of the gentlemen who have visited our communities and have 
written articles that have appeared in magazines and newspapers. By 
reason of the trend of their conversation and their interest I have been 
greatly impressed with the fact that the interest that has been aroused 
is not going to be wholly satisfied by learning something about our Church 
Security Program. The progress which we have made is fully up to my 
expectations. The response of the membership of the Church in the 
increase of Fast offerings and Tithing last year was most encouraging. 
I do most sincerely trust that we shall not hesitate now, but that we 
shall continue this good effort and raise our quotas in the payment of our 
Fast offerings at least up to the standard of the minimum for the 
poorest members of the Church, to the dollar suggested by the Presidency. 
We did not reach it last year. We are making progress toward it, and 
I hope that none of us will be content until we have at least reached 
that objective. The reason is that we need that assistance. Our program 
is going only as fast as we have the means, and we do not propose to 
run in debt to try to solve the problem, but we are consuming the means 
that come to us in an effort to solve this important undertaking which 
the Church has in hand at this moment. 

APPEAL TO MEMBERS 

If there ever was an occasion in the history of the Church when 
the non-tithepayer or the individuals who have not paid Fast offerings 
ought to be appealed to effectively it is now. Surely there is not a man who 
claims membership in the Church who is going to stand by and see his 
Church humiliated, because he did not do his part. There is not a man, 
though he does not live up to all the requirements of the Gospel, but that 
has a pride in his Church. He likes to hear good things said about it. 
He wants to see it fulfill its undertakings. And, therefore, I do appeal 
to you, my brethren who have to do with the encouragement on the 
part of those who have not yet done their full duty in assisting us, before 
the close of the year, that we shall have many of them aroused to the 
point where they will give us that assistance, not only because we need 
the help, but because it will bring to them blessings, spiritual blessings 
and material blessings at the hands of the Lord, 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 



21 



PROBLEMS SOLVED IN THE LORD'S WAY 

The greatest feature of our program has not been the assistance 
we have rendered to others — while that has been most satisfactory, one 
of the greatest contributions that the Church has received out of the 
program has been the awakened interest on the part of the indifferent 
who have come to participate and become active in the Church work. It 
will become a savior to many of them, and if we persist in this program 
as we certainly shall do, and with the aid and help of our brothers and 
sisters and the blessing of the Lord, in due time we will solve the 
problem, and when we have done it, it will be a monument to us that will 
attract the ends of the earth; because we are dealing with a problem 
that is world-wide, every nation, every community has the same identical 
problem and they are struggling, by various ways and means, some by 
Communism and some by Fascism and some by other methods to solve 
the problem ; but we know that it can only be solved in the Lord's way. 
We have the Lord's way, and it is our responsibility to demonstrate to 
the world that the Lord's way is effective, that it will work, but the 
interest that has been aroused will create further inquiry into the lives 
of the people. They will want to know how we live in the home ; our 
social life; our relations with each other, in an age when there is a 
growing doubt concerning the vitality of the Christian denominations 
arid their ability to meet and solve human problems. This is the oppor- 
tune time to prove to the world that the real Gospel of the Lord Jesus 
Christ, which we have received, does have in it the power to make men 
capable of living up to the highest standards that have been given to 
mankind in the restored Gospel of Jesus Christ. No other people in 
the history of this world have had put before them higher ideals than 
have the Latter-day Saints. When this inspection comes, I am getting 
exceedingly anxious that we shall be so well prepared when they 
come not only to learn about our security program, but come to learn 
about our personal lives, our relationships with each other, that they will 
discover that we have a practical religion that goes with us into the 
shop, into the farm, into the factory, into our social lives, that wherever 
we go we take our religion with us and that it is effective in making us 
different. 

KEEPING OF WORD OF WISDOM URGED 

The President has just made an appeal, and I am with him one 
hundred percent. I shall continue wherever I go in the stakes of Zion, 
to appeal to the young people of the Church, and the older people as well, 
to live up to the Word of Wisdom. I want to make this additional 
appeal to you, my brethren and sisters, that not only for the blessings 
and the benefits that will flow to us, shall we keep the Word of Wisdom, 
financially and spiritually, but for the blessing it will be to the world. 
When they come from abroad, as the prophets of old said they would, 
one of a city and two of a family from the ends of the earth to the tops of 
the mountains, where the House of the Lord should be established — the 



22 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



prophets said the peoples of the east and the west and the north and the 
south would say, "Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the 
house of the God of Jacob, that we may learn of his ways and walk in 
his paths" — when they come I am exceedingly anxious that they shall 
not find Latter-day Saint girls and boys smoking. If they do not, it will be 
a distinguishing thing, for they will not find such a situation anywhere 
else in the world. We want you to be the hope of the world, the very 
light of the world, the salt of the earth. You have a responsibility, with 
the superior knowledge that has come to you, to be an example. When 
they come I do not want them to find Latter-day Saint boys and girls 
drinking liquor, or beer with its alcohol content, condemned by the 
Lord, because it is a strong drink. 

STANDARDS SHOULD BE MAINTAINED 

When they come to be close to us in our social life, I want them 
to find us living up to our high standards, for we have received instruc- 
tions from our youth, that the boy shall be as clean and as chaste as the 
girl ; that there is no double standard, and that each one of us regards 
preservation of chastity as more precious than life itself. I want them, 
when they come, to find us living up to our high privileges, having 
entered into the house of God and entered into sacred contracts with 
each other that shall endure through time and eternity, that we are not 
a people who quickly dissolve our marriage contracts as the world does. 
Our standard today — our record, leads the world, but we can make it 
better than it is. When they come and inspect our homes, I do not want 
them to find homes without children. I want them to find typical Latter- 
day Saint homes, the heritage of the Lord, children welcomed in those 
homes, that make them ideal. When they come to inspect us in our 
business relations, I want them to find a Mormon's word still as good 
as his bond; that we pay our debts and that we fulfill our contracts 
to the best of our ability 

OPPORTUNITY NOW TO GET AHEAD 

When they come to find us in our material possessions, I am ex- 
ceedingly anxious that they shall find, as it is now, a larger percentage 
of our people owning their own homes than any other people. We 
are not quite up to the standards of our fathers, however. I would like 
to see us recover our former positions. * When they come, also, to 
discover the status of our farms and homes I hope they will find us in 
a more favorable condition than any people, that we have freed our 
homes and our farms from the mortgage that is upon them. 

I would like to say this to you, my brothers and sisters, I feel in 
my heart that we, as a people, have never had a better day to pay our 
debts than right now, and I have a feeling that we will have several good 
years to do that in. Somebody misquoted, or at least misconstrued my 
appeal to the people in Arizona to store up food for the care of the poor, 
and had me saying that a great panic was right at our door. As far as 



ELDER MELVIN I. BALLARD 



23 



this country is concerned I do not believe that. I believe that there are 
several good years ahead of us here. Let us employ them to get out 
of debt. During the height of the depression I said in several places that 
then was a good time to borrow money, because you could not borrow very 
much, and no matter what you spent it for, it would be profitable. Now 
is a good time to pay our debts. Let us free ourselves, if we can con- 
sistently, now. 

SURROUNDINGS PREACH THE GOSPEL 

I am exceedingly anxious that as they come to see Latter-day Saint 
homes they will be impressed that here are people who love culture. 
We would like the front gate to preach the Gospel, because it has all its 
pickets on, and has a coat of paint on it. We would like to see the homes 
in which we live as beautiful as we can afford to make them. We would 
like them surrounded with shrubbery that proclaims our love of the 
beautiful. We would like them to find us the finest civilization there is 
in the world. 

I remember a few years ago, when there stood in this pulpit a great 
economist, I think one of the greatest in the world, who had been visiting 
Utah on several occasions and had been teaching here in our summer 
schools, Dr. Thomas Nixon Carver, who said, 

If I were searching the whole world over to find a people who were 
building an advanced civilization, I would come here to Utah and learn 
of it from you Mormons. 

A RELIGION THAT SUSTAINS 

I want us prepared when they come to show the world that here 
is a religion that could sustain our fathers when martyrdom met 
them and took their leaders. Here is a religion that could sustain 
our fathers when they were driven from their homes, and their 
homes were pillaged and burned, sustained them when they journeyed 
across the plains ; sustained them in the battle with the wilderness and 
supported them under trials, when their enemies slandered and vilified 
them, and they stood like beaten anvils under it all. I want them to come 
and find us in our prosperity still true to that faith, not having patterned 
after the ways of the world. Young men and young women, God never 
expected you to be like the world ; not to be imitators. Your mission is 
to be pattern makers, to hold up an ensign, to create hope in the world 
and faith in the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, having power to mold 
men's hearts to conquer their weaknesses and make them susceptible 
to live up to the high standards of this restored Gospel of Jesus Christ ; 
and all of it is to fit and prepare us to live as ladies and gentlemen in the 
presence of the great king, God the eternal Father. 

If all this brought human misery — to conquer one's appetite, to 
subject oneself to the Gospel standards — if all this brought unhappiness 
and misery, I would be afraid to say what I am saying, but I know the 



24 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



testimony of thousands and have proven it in my own experience, that 
there is no life lived on this earth that is so happy, so full of joy and satis- 
faction, so abundant in health and life, with greater spirituality and 
greater intelligence, than that enjoyed among the Latter-day Saints who 
live up to these Gospel standards. 

JOY IN ACHIEVEMENT 

We get our reward here and now. Our joy, our achievements, have 
brought us heaven right now, and it is preparing us for an eternal 
heaven that is yet to come. I do know that our fathers and mothers 
were great men and women. They subdued the desert and conquered 
it, but I know that we have a greater task, to conquer ourselves, to master 
ourselves and subscribe to this high standard of living. If we shall do it, 
when the ends of the earth come to see us they will learn of our ways 
and be willing to walk in our paths. We shall find a joy in the achieve- 
ment and bring honor and credit to the work of God. 

God bless us that we shall be ready for the day of inspection. It 
is going to come — whether you are ready for it or not. I trust we 
shall not be embarrassed, but that we shall set our own houses in order, 
where we need to, also our own personal lives, and make a great con- 
tribution to glorify the name of God and to become here, on the tops 
of these mountains, the very light of the world, the hope of mankind, 
I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

An anthem, "List the Cherubic Host," (Gaul) was sung by the 
Singing Mothers, Mrs. Emery Epperson, soloist. 

Elder Stephen L. Chipman, President of the Salt Lake Temple, 
offered the closing prayer. 

Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock. 



FIRST DAY 
AFTERNOON MEETING 

The second session of the Conference convened promptly at 2 o'clock, 
Friday afternoon, October 1. 

The Relief Society Singing Mothers furnished the music for this 
session, and sang as an opening number "Unfold Ye Portals." 

Elder David Smith, President of the North Idaho Falls Stake, 
offered the opening prayer. 

An anthem, "Sleepers, Wake! A Voice is Sounding," (J. S. Bach) 
was sung by the Singing Mothers. 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS

ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

I have enjoyed the spirit and instruction of this Conference so far. 
I feel very happy, my brethren and sisters, in my religion — the religion 
of the Latter-day Saints, which has sustained me through a life of 
nearly seventy-seven years, meeting every religious requirement, sup- 
plying every religious need. I know that this work in which we are 
engaged is the work of the Lord. 

TESTIMONY 

I am very happy in the knowledge revealed to Joseph Smith in the 
beginning of this dispensation, when the Father and the Son appeared 
unto him. I know that that revelation is true. I know that God, the 
Eternal Father, lives and, contrary to the views of the great majority 
of mankind, he is a personage having a body of flesh and bones and 
spirit as tangible as is the body of man, glorified and exalted, the 
Creator of heaven and earth and all things therein by his Son, Jesus 
Christ ; a God of love, of mercy, of justice, and of truth, who answers the 
prayers of his faithful children. I know that Jesus Christ is the Son 
of God, the Savior and the Redeemer of this world, chosen and ordained 
from the foundations of this earth, and that through his work all mankind 
are redeemed from the effects of the fall of our first parents. As the 
scriptures teach: 

Since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the 
dead, 

For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. 
(I Cor. 15:21, 22) 

This resurrection is necessary in order that we may have bodies, 
reunited spirit and element of body, never more to be separated. In 
that condition we will be prepared to enter the kingdom of God, provided 
we meet the provisions made in the Gospel, that we yield obedience 
unto the laws and ordinances thereof, for the atonement of our Lord 
and Savior is to redeem us of our individual sins on condition of our 
obedience unto the laws and ordinances of the Gospel. 

I know to my perfect satisfaction that Joseph Smith was a prophet 
of God, having been thoroughly convinced by investigation and by the 
Spirit and power of God, and his works prove him to be a prophet in 
very deed, inspired of the Lord as he was in life. I know that those 
who have succeeded him in the Presidency of this Church have been 
God's mouthpiece unto the people, inspired from on high, and have 
directed the work of the Lord, as it has progressed and prospered con- 
tinuously, and that he who stands at the head of the Church today, as 
its President, is a man of God, the mouthpiece and prophet of the 
Lord to his people and to the world, inspired from on high for the great 
responsibilities that rest upon him

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



GOSPEL THE POWER OF GOD UNTO SALVATION 

This work in which we are engaged as Latter-day Saints is none 
other than the Gospel of Jesus Christ, which was instituted in the 
councils of the heavens before the world was; that which was taught 
by the Savior and his disciples ; that of which the Apostle Paul spoke 
in writing to the Galatians when he said : 

But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other Gospel 
unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. 
(Gal. 1 :8) 

It is the power of God unto salvation, temporally and spiritually, as 
has been already explained in this Conference. It is the law by which, 
all mankind are to be judged, and by it condemned or justified according 
to merit. Justice, therefore, demands that this Gospel shall be preached 
and taught to all men, or, as the scriptures say : 

Until the law, sin was in the world, but sin is not imputed where 
there is no law. 

In the mercy and justice of God, our Eternal Father, this Gospel will 
be taught unto all men. Those who have not had the privilege of hearing 
it in the earth, have the privilege of hearing it hereafter, and inasmuch as 
there are ordinances to be received necessary to man's salvation, provision 
has been made in the Gospel, that all who are living shall, by genealogical 
research, find out and know their ancestors who are dead, and go into 
the temples of the Lord and there redeem them, by receiving for them 
those saving ordinances vicariously. 

This Gospel which we have received is the plan by which our Lord 
and Savior lived while he was here in the flesh. It made him what he 
was in life and what he is, enthroned in glory, at the right hand of the 
Father. It is intended to make us like him, to save us with him, joint 
heirs with Jesus Christ of all that the Father possesses. 

RESPONSIBILITY TOWARD OTHERS 

We have the responsibility, as Latter-day Saints, to preach this 
Gospel of the kingdom to all the world, as a witness, before the end 
shall come. For more than a century, the Latter-day Saints have been 
engaged in this important work, and many honest souls, from many 
nations and from the islands of the sea have, through the preaching of 
the Gospel embraced it and lived their religion. Many of them have 
gone faithfully to their reward. 

There are all about us today men and women who know not God, 
who know not religion — the true religion of the Master — nor salvation, 
of what it consists and how it may be attained. They are in deep spiritual 
darkness and are among the unfortunate of our Father's children. We 
as Latter-day Saints have received the light, and we know the way. The 
responsibility rests upon us to reach out for those who are groveling in 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 



27 



darkness. I think of the parable of the Savior, the rich man and the poor, 
and the consequences of neglect of the living to feed the hungry and 
to clothe the naked, and minister unto the human needs of mankind. That 
neglect is suffered for in hell and torment, so the scriptures tell us. 
and I remember, too, that we read, in the scriptures what the Lord had 
to say to Ezekiel. The responsibility was laid upon him, as a watchman 
upon the towers of Zion, to warn mankind, and he was told that if he 
did not do it their blood would be upon his hands. 

I do hope and pray that we as Latter-day Saints as a Church, and 
as individuals, may be able to wash our hands clean of the blood and sins 
of this generation, by looking to the saving of the souls of our Father's 
children, as well as our own. In looking to the interests and the salvation 
of others we are making for our own salvation and glory. We have 
our dead to be redeemed, a tremendous responsibility resting upon us. 
We are expected, I think, to do more than anyone of us is able to do, by 
going into the temple and receiving these ordinances. God has blessed 
us with the abundance of this earth, and I think he expects us to use 
liberally of the wealth that he has placed in our laps in the redeeming 
of our dead. This can be done by employing men and women whose 
financial conditions are such that otherwise they are obliged to labor for 
a mere pittance. A great deal of the labor that is being done in the 
temple is being done gratuitously. It is only one element of that work 
that we have to pay for — a proxy to do the work for us. And in 
employing this class of people, I feel that we are supporting and sustain- 
ing this great Church movement. We are feeding the hungry, we are 
clothing the naked. We are ministering unto those who are in need, 
and by so doing we place ourselves in that class referred to as being on 
the right hand of the Savior when he shall come, and to whom he shall 
say: 

Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you 
from the foundation of the world : 

For I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat : I was thirsty, and ye 
gave me drink : I was a stranger, and ye took me in. 

There is an abundance in this world and to spare. The Lord has 
so said by revelation. Those of us who are fortunate should look to 
the unfortunate, for that is religion pure and undefiled. We ought to 
be willing to divide what we have, whether it be much or little, in order 
to prevent suffering among the children of men. This Gospel is one of 
love, of sacrifice, and of service, from beginning to end. Both the 
Father and the Son have set us a wonderful example with respect to 
these principles. As we read in the scriptures, 

For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that 
whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. 
(John 3:16) 

The Son gave himself because of the love he had for the children of 
men. He said, 



28 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



... I lay down my life, that I might take it again. 

No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. (John 
10:17-18) 

Here is love supreme — perfect love, the love of a God manifest in 
a gift, the greatest that was ever given ; his sacrifice, the greatest that was 
ever made; in service, the noblest, the most important that ever was 
rendered. 

We, our Father's children, are expected to follow their example. 
Nothing short of this will meet the requirements of the Gospel and make 
for our eternal satisfaction. 

May the Lord.help us to see our duty to ourselves, our duty to our 
God and to our fellow men, living and dead, to discharge ourselves faith- 
fully while in line of these duties and responsibilities and make every 
preparation necessary for the life which is to come, I pray in the name 
of Jesus Christ, Amen 

ELDER RUFUS K. HARDY 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

My beloved brethren and sisters, during the few moments that I 
stand before you, I trust that I may have not only an interest in your 
faith and prayers but that I may have from you an assurance of your 
desire to hear the truths of our faith and to further all that God desires 
you to do. 

As a child, I can remember these great gatherings, these conferences 
which we now are attending. I recall distinctly that there are two definite, 
fixed things in my mind which have stayed there from that day to 
this. Those two things were a knowledge that the Lord God had again 
come to earth and had spoken to his servant, and that Christ lived, and 
that through him we were actuated and did those things which God 
would desire us to do. Even as John has recorded concerning the 
Christ, so was the belief of .our people then and of our people now — that 
Christ did come, that Christ did live and that he and his works, through 
the children of men, glorified and magnified that great work of God. 

I recall distinctly that the other thing which left its impress upon 
my mind was the fact that the Priesthood of God had come to earth and 
that we had received that Priesthood and that through it and by it the 
things which we, the members of the Church of Jesus Christ, were able 
to accomplish, were made possible. 

I remember as a lad in early days coming to Conference and seeing 
practically hundreds, yes, thousands of horses tied on the outside of this 
block and tied in the vacant lots around; teams that were hitched to 
wagons, to white-tops, and buckboards. Today, with the march of time 
and the progress of the Church, we come here now, as did they, as 
members of this Church, even as we assembled to worship and give 
thanks to God when I was a lad. Now we wait until the closing of each 
session of this Conference to go outside and find patiently waiting for 
us, not horses, but the latest model of a high-powered automobile and 



ELDER RUFUS K. HARDY

when we reach it, there it stands in its shimmering colors and glory, and 
all we have to do is to turn a key in its door when we come again into 
this Church. But that same spirit, that same love, and that same hope 
which actuated our fathers and mothers, I feel very, very confident, is 
here today and actuates us. 

There are some things which to us are the dearest things in the 
world. I think two of these things are a knowledge that the Lord and 
Savior, Jesus Christ, 'did come, and a knowledge that the Gospel is 
preached today by the power of the Priesthood that was given to the 
apostles anciently. 

John says: 

We know that the Son of God is come and hath given to us an 
understanding that we may know him that is true; and we are in him 
that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, the 
eternal life. 

So much has been wrought by our own kindred who are now dead 
and gone through a knowledge of this wonderful thing which has come 
unto them and unto us. Man is given many powers and many opportuni- 
ties. He is also given an individuality which individuality is his and 
cannot be taken from him. He has his love. He has his faith. He has 
his understanding of Deity, and this individuality that God has given 
each of us is held absolutely responsible for all that it does and all that 
shall occur. Even so in life, as we must go through life with the 
individuality which God has given us — we cannot barter it or give it to 
another — on into death we carry that individuality and there we shall 
be judged according to the things that we have done here upon this 
earth by the individuality which God gave us. 

Now, with that understanding and with that knowledge, we must 
remember that man has within himself apparently two things which are 
opposed : perfect independence and, at the same time, perfect union and 
cohesion with a few or with many members of a body such as is this ; 
that on down through this earth life of ours and eternal life we may 
march and walk retaining, at the same time, our own individuality. 

Some things have come into our lives, however, that are a little 
different from the olden days. A new note is sounding, and that new 
note has been ringing around this world into every nook and corner, 
conveying somewhat of the influence which the Church is showing and 
the momentous things it has taken hold of and put its hand to do. The 
name of this Church has been carried everywhere and this is not strange, 
because we expected that. But back to us has come the echo of this 
great broadcast, and that echo is one of praise, one of commendation. 
This is unusual, rather new, a startling thing for us, and I sincerely 
hope and trust that as we look at it, as we listen to it, and as we calmly 
sense that this has come, not through our individual effort but through 
the mercy and the blessing of the Lord God Almighty, through the 
power of his Priesthood, that we shall, with meekness and humbleness, 
acknowledge that power and that great work which now is showered upon 
the heads of the members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 



30 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Saints, and praises are sung to it. It is through this wonderful thing, 
the Priesthood, that this has all come. 

I wish you would, when you can, read again the 84th Section of 
the Doctrine and Covenants. Study it and think of it and see if it does 
not fit us. I have here a few verses which I would like to read to you 
and those verses on the Priesthood are as follows : 

Which priesthood continueth in the church of God in all generations, 
and is without beginning of days or end of years. * * * 

And this greater priesthood administereth the gospel and holdeth the 
key of the mysteries of the kingdom, even the key of the knowledge of God. 

Therefore, in the ordinances thereof, the power of godliness is manifest. 

And without the ordinances thereof, and the authority of the priest- 
hood, the power of godliness is not manifest unto men in the flesh; 

For without this no man can see the face of God, even the Father, 
and live. * * * 

For the word of the Lord is truth, and whatsoever is truth is light, 
and whatsoever is light is Spirit, even the Spirit of Jesus Christ. 

And the Spirit giveth light to every man that cometh into the world; 
and the Spirit enlighteneth every man through the world, that hearkeneth 
to the voice of the Spirit. * * * 

And this revelation unto you, and commandment, is in force from 
this very hour upon all the world, and the gospel is unto all who have 
not received it. * * * 

And any man that shall go and preach this gospel of the kingdom, 
and fail not to- continue faithful in all things, shall not be weary in mind, 
neither darkened, neither in body, limb, nor joint; and a hair bf his head 
shall not fall to the ground unnoticed. And they shall not go hungry, 
neither athirst. * * * 

For I, the Lord, have put forth my hand to exert the powers of heaven ; 
ye cannot see it now, yet a little while and ye shall see it, and know that 
I am, and that I will come and reign with my people. 

If we may continue to have that same sweet, satisfying faith that 
was possessed by our fathers and mothers, with their toil-worn hands 
empty though they were, who came to these Conferences and attended 
them for the spiritual uplift they gave, and if we may continue ever 
onward in that channel and in that path, I am satisfied that God's 
blessings will be upon us, and I ask them to continue so, in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

This thought has been running through my mind, "Why do I live?" 
It is bothering me a good deal. Brother Francis M. Lyman said : "Death 
is nothing, if you can get dead. Why fear death?" I haven't gotten 
rid of that fear yet. 

Brethren and sisters, I would like to feel that I am one of your 
number and I am one of your brothers, and I have tried as best I could, 
up to the present date, to fulfill my mission and complete my labors. I 
am not afraid of the Lord, but I am afraid of the location. I do not 
know where I will be located. I hope it will be a good place. 

I have in my pocket a paper— I haven't got it in my mind ; I wish

I did. There is a book published called "J- Golden Kimball," and it has 
been sold among some of the people. In this book Claude Richards has 
preserved some of the talks that I have made — most of them talks that 
I have made in the Tabernacle. I am very glad some of the talks I have 
made outside were not printed. We will forget them. I discover in 
checking up on these talks that there have been forty-eight made by 
me during General Church Conferences. Out of that number I have 
selected one which I shall not attempt to read, but I would like to have 
the permission of the Presidency of the Church, after this talk has been 
edited and looked over, to publish it in the Conference Pamphlet as the 
talk that I would like to make on this occasion. I feel that it is so 
important to me and to the young people that it should be cried out from 
the housetops. 

TALK BY ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL 
October, 1926—11 Years Ago 

"No man knoweth how much good he does, so that I feel to encourage 
the Priesthood of God. We never know how much good we do when 
we speak in the name of the Lord. I don't believe, I can't believe, that 
I ever converted a man in my life, but I have taught the truth, I have 
preached the Gospel, and my voice has been heard from Canada to 
Mexico more times than once. I was in the General Board of the Young 
Men's Associations for thirty years and I have never had greater joy 
or greater happiness than in lifting up my voice among the rising gener- 
ation. How much good we do, as I stated before, no man knoweth. I 
claim that every man fills his niche when he is called of God and set 
apart and ordained to an office. He may not fill it in the way someone 
else would fill it, but if he is a man of courage he will fill it in his own 
way, under the influence of the Holy Spirit. 

Like my father, I have no apology to make for my origin. I was 
told once that my trouble was I was trying to be like my father. Well, 
thank God I can try to be like him a little, but I was too young when 
my father died to remember his mannerisms and his method of speech. 

LUXURY A DANGER TO RISING GENERATION 

My brethren and sisters, I want to lift up a danger signal to the 
rising generation. In doing it I want to be very careful of the way in 
which I express it; I shall attempt to read it, although it is against my 
grain to do so. 

This great country, North and South America, the Prophet Joseph 
Smith declared, is Zion, the land of the pure in heart. It would seem 
to me that a great responsibility rests particularly with the young men 
and women of this generation. 

The question naturally arises: What is the trend of the times for 
modern sons and daughters of Zion? Riches and culture, ease and 
luxury. Everything is money and money is everything. The golden 
key unlocks all doors, that is, it prys them open. 



32 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Plenty of money entitles you to anything : honor, society, and emolu- 
ments. The rising generation who are poor look upon this pleasure- 
loving people with envy and a yearning for worldly things. And as 
the spirit of the age in which we live takes hold of them, they assert 
their individual independence and break away from what are called 
"old-fogy ideas, old bigotries, old superstitions." They go recklessly 
wild, at sixty miles an hour, claiming what is termed the "new liberty 
of the twentieth century," and run daringly into forbidden pastures. 
Today all over America we see everywhere among the rich and poor, 
the cultured, educated, and ignorant, the indications of the sensual ten- 
dencies of the age, and we forget for the moment the degradation and 
destruction to which such a life leads. 

SENSUAL PLEASURE 

No single instance can be given as evidence that unlawful sensual 
pleasure can be indulged in without paying for it a thousand times in 
pain and remorse. 

The danger signals are set up at the gate of the garden of sensual 
pleasure. The angel stands with his sword of flame, and no man, woman, 
youth, or maiden enters unsmitten of him. "In the path of sensuality 
in all its multitplied forms our Heavenly Father has placed barriers 
mountain high to stop us and frighten us back from ruin, disease, and 
degradation." 

As wealth increases in any country and with any people, the tendency 
to sensuality (through the many temptations of ease, idleness, and grati- 
fication of one's appetite, the elevation of fashion, style, and living 
beyond a certain point of safety and security) is the cause of the down- 
fall of hundreds of thousands of God's children. 

That "money-devil," if not used in doing good, is the lion right 
across the highway of our future, standing, teasing, menacing — just 
at the forks of the road, to lead us to ruin and unhappiness. If the 
roofs could be lifted off the palaces of the rich, what sights might not 
be seen, what skeletons in the closets, what sorrows, what shams, what 
sights. — -Watson. 

When we open our eyes to the danger that menaces the rising 
generation, life would seem to be a very dangerous sea if we take note 
of the ruined thousands that strew its shores. 

DEATH NOT A CALAMITY 

We, therefore, cannot look upon death as a great sorrow and calamity 
when it involves no stain of honor and no loss of character. We wisely 
conclude the hand of Providence is in it, and good must come out of it, 
and we are comforted. 

When we contemplate and think of our young men and women 
with their bright hopes of love, of truth and purity, of goodly gifts from 
God, of mind, of all sweet affections and aspirations, gone down, blotted 
out and spoiled, we cannot feel otherwise — be as hopeful and cheerful 



ELDER L GOLDEN KIMBALL

as we may — that lif e is dangerous unless we are guided and influenced 
by the Holy Spirit and directed by steady hands, by men and women as 
teachers of virtue, truth and happiness, who are not afraid to speak in 
the name of the Lord. 

BY THEIR FRUITS YE SHALL KNOW THEM 

The fruit of religion manifests itself in the lives of men. "By 
their fruits ye shall know them." There can be no deception by men 
who love God. and keep his commandments. We are one and all God's 
children. He created us and he never created a failure, and he created 
you. 

HAPPINESS THE DESIGN OF OUR CREATOR 

"Men are that they might have joy." "Happiness is the object 
and design of our creation and will be to the end of our existence if we 
pursue the path that leads to it. This path is virtue, uprightness, faith- 
fulness, holiness." To keep God's commandments we must know them. 
To know them we must read the scriptures and repent and be in tune 
with the Holy Spirit and he will lead us into all truth and show us things 
to come. I promise you that you shall hear a voice behind you saying, 
"This is the way, walk ye in it." 

TEMPTATIONS 

Remember this always : Temptation somewhere in the life of all 
finds us, as this life is a testing time. Therefore, watch and pray and 
ask God to leave us not in temptation and deliver us from evil, as 
temptation is ever lying in wait, and in a thousand forms is temptation 
repeated. There is divine wisdom in praying always and avoiding the 
very appearance of evil. 

A HELPING HAND 

There is very little use of preaching religion or morals, or honesty, 
virtue, and truthfulness to those whose motives and tendencies all point 
toward vice and sensuality unless they repent and sin no more. These 
wild, reckless, dissipated young people will not come to us, so we must 
reach out a helping hand and go to them. 

RESPONSIBILITY OF PARENTS 

This great change for the uplift and betterment of this great country 
— Zion, the pure in heart — rests very largely, almost entirely, with the 
home and the parents. 

back to Christ's -religion 

We must, for the safety of the youth of Zion, come back to Jesus 
Christ's religion and its spiritual forces. We must teach the gospel of 
repentance and forgiveness which has made men's and women's lives 



34 GENERAL CONFERENCE 



happier, tasks lighter, judgment steadier, as it truly comforts the dis- 
consolate, forgotten sinners, and leads them to a clear life of virtue, 
love, and happiness. No child of God can escape Christ's religion. 
Intelligence and knowledge of the right kind walk ever close to religion. 

ADVICE TO PARENTS 

My conclusion is : There is just one great, big, lif e-and-death duty 
of the parents of children, the church and the state, and that is to keep 
every boy and girl under proper schooling and give to them "love, 
pleasure, work, and worship." 

You good people and parents living on your farms in the country, 
I plead with you not to send your children to cities, where the beautiful 
spirit of things God created perishes. Let them live in the open, in the 
beautiful valleys, on the mountains, in God's sunshine, near streams, 
rivers, and trees and let his Spirit teach them of the things of God. 

HAVE GIVEN BEST EFFORT 

My testimony, brethren and sisters, in all confidence, is that I know 
this work is true. I have tested it out. I have found God. I am a man 
of weakness ; I am a man full of faults ; but God knows I have given 
him the best effort there was in me. 

GOD LIVES 

i 

I know God lives, that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, the Redeemer 
of the world. And when men have tempted me to deny this — which 
they have tried to do — I have talked to some of them, learned men, I 
have talked to doctors, I have talked to young men who have gone out 
and filled missions, come home and got education, and they have tried 
to burn all my bridges behind me but, thank God, I had a testimony and 
I know ! I have told them : "In what you offer me there is no happiness." 

JOSEPH A TRUE PROPHET 

If any man can prove to me that Joseph Smith is not a prophet of 
God, he has taken everything; he has burned every bridge behind me. 
I never saw the Prophet, but I have heard my father talk about him and 
I have read his revelations and his prophecies, and I know they are 
true. He is a Prophet of God. I sustain the Church and uphold the 
hands of the Priesthood as best I know how. God bless you. Amen. 

The Singing Mothers and the congregation sang the hymn, "We 
Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet." 

ELDER STEPHEN L RICHARDS 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

I should like to address a brief message to the young people of the 
Church who are just now entering the schools and colleges of the land. 



ELDER STEPHEN L RICHARDS

FAITH BRINGS HUMILITY 

I expect to say something concerning the acquisition and retention 
of the philosophy of faith, but before doing so I should like to mention 
some of its attributes, or more specifically the characteristics with which 
it invests those who subscribe to it. In the first place, in direct contrast 
to the philosophy of self-sufficiency, which is the philosophy of the world, 
faith brings to a man humility — not servility, but a modest, unpreten- 
tious, submissive attitude which makes him conscious of and amenable 
to powers and forces higher and more potential than himself. There is 
in my estimation no good reason why this philosophy of humility and 
faith should in any way detract from man's intelligence. I am not 
prepared to say that there have not been times in the world's history 
when men have unduly leaned upon a religious faith to the detriment of 
the cultivation of intelligence, but I am sure that in this day of enlight- 
enment, when education has done so much to free man from the bondage 
of superstition and error, faith is no hindrance to learning. On the 
contrary, faith begets a desire for knowledge, and what is even more 
important, it establishes a perspective in the acquisititon of knowledge 
that is truly essential in the appraisement of relative values. 

STIMULATION THROUGH RECOGNITION OF HIGHER POWER 

The recognition of power higher than man himself does not in 
any sense debase him. If in his faith he ascribes beneficence and high 
purpose to the power which is superior to himself, he envisions a higher 
destiny and nobler attributes for his kind and is stimulated and encour- 
aged in the struggle of existence. He has confidence in the justice of 
eternal and unchanging law, which is not subject to the caprice and 
fitful will of men. 

If he is unsuccessful in his ventures in worldly affairs, if he suffers 
defeat, he may be disappointed and sorrowful, but he is not despondent 
and he is not bitter. His philosophy does not despise any worthy ma- 
terial accomplishment, but it assigns to each phase of living its proper 
place in the eternal scheme of things so that no one in the household of 
faith is ever completely discouraged, unless, unhappily, he loses faith 
itself. 

To the man who is successful in worldly achievement, faith brings 
humility in lieu of arrogance, without robbing the able man, however, 
of that glow of satisfaction which ever attends noble effort. In this 
philosophy of the higher realm men of intelligence and skill conceive 
the part they play in life as missions rather than careers, fulfilling their 
assignments in a program infinitely greater than they themselves can 
devise, utilizing materials and facilities and forces over which, by 
grace, they have been given dominion, and subserving purposes eternal 
and transcendently beautiful. 

THE HIGHEST ORDER OF INTELLIGENCE 

These men of intelligence and ability, who are also men of faith, 
would tell you, if you asked them, that faith in spiritual realities has 



36 GENERAL CONFERENCE 



never daunted their quest for knowledge and their ambition for all 
legitimate achievement, and I think they will tell you, if you press them, 
that the highest order of intelligence they have discovered in their 
experience is that intelligence which perceives spiritual concepts and 
adequately correlates these concepts with things of the finite world. I 
am very sure that they who understand faith will not deprecate the mind 
which it blesses. So to the rich or poor, the high or lowly, the successful 
and those who fail, the philosophy of faith brings stability, poise, com- 
posure, hope, and enduring satisfaction. It is a vital and priceless 
acquisition. It is not always easy to attain. 

FAITH A DIVINE GIFT 

What of the ways of securing faith? I admit that difficulties 
are to be encountered because a man cannot really know what faith is 
until he has experienced it, nor can he really experience it without 
recognizing it for what it is. It is rather confusing to say to one who 
denies the reality of spiritual things, "You, sir, cannot know what faith 
is because you have never had it and you cannot get it as long as you 
deny it." This sounds paradoxical, but in reality it is not so absurd as 
it sounds, for this reason — faith is a divine gift open to all men to 
receive, if only their attitude and life will permit its reception. It is true 
only the faithful know this, but their knowledge of it is so certain that 
they never despair of bringing the knowledge to others. In this absolute 
certitude of the faithful lies the hope and promise of universal con- 
version. 

AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP IN ACQUIRING FAITH 

Now I propose as an important first step in acquiring faith, particu- 
larly by those of little maturity in the thinking process, a recognition, 
of the difference between the realm of things spiritual and the realm of 
things material ; between faith and spirit on the one hand, and mind and 
matter on the other. It is always desirable, I believe, to bear in mind this 
distinction. It is particularly important to those of limited years or 
experience, who may be having some difficulty in their thinking, in 
making certain adjustments and reconciliations. 

Let me give you an example : A young man raised in a household 
of faith has always been taught to pray. He has assumed and felt, 
probably without much thinking about it, that there is a superior power 
to hear and answer his prayers. This young man goes to college. Among 
his studies he pursues some of the sciences — astronomy, geology, biology, 
let us say. One day, perhaps in a purely casual way, someone asks him, 
"Do you pray?" It may be a classmate, or even a teacher. "Why 
certainly," he replies. "Why shouldn't I?" "To whom do you pray?" 
is the next question. "Why, to God, of course." "Where is your 
God?" "What is he like? Have you ever seen him? How do you 
know he exists?" Well, these questions he can not so easily answer. 
He pauses for reply, and in that pause an avalanche of new thoughts 
and novel sensations almost overwhelm him, and very likely in real 



ELDER STEPHEN L RICHARDS 



37 



confusion this young man says to himself, "How do I know? What 
do I really know?" • 

In his study of the sciences he has learned something of the scien- 
tific process. He knows that everything must be demonstrated before 
conclusions can legitimately be reached, and he knows that the demon- 
strations required are those that are tangible and susceptible of very 
definite and positive human proof. He has had an introduction into 
the realm of reason, and for the moment at least the methods of that 
realm dominate his intelligence and his senses. How fortunate is this 
young man, if, after the first rush of these perplexing thoughts, it 
occurs to him that there is a wide difference between the province of 
science and reason on the one hand and that of the spiritual and feeling 
on the other. Now, fully aware of this difference, he replies to his 
inquisitors, "Why yes, I know that God lives. I do not know where he 
is, I have never seen him, but I am perfectly satisfied that he exists, 
and this I know through my faith. I don't ask for the same kind of 
proof and demonstration that are required in the sciences. I am not 
dealing with similar matters. My faith is a matter of feeling and inward 
conviction. I know that there is a divine world as well as I know that 
I love my mother. These are matters of feeling. My soul is satisfied. 
That is all I ask." 

MERELY ARGUMENTS 

Now I would not have you think that the young man of my illus- 
tration could not have brought to the support of his conviction many 
persuasive and convincing arguments. He might have asked his in- 
quirers to account for the universe with its illimitable manifestations of 
law and order without the dominance of a master mind. He might have 
brought to his aid the records of sacred and profane history, the universal 
prevalence of the idea of Deity among all nations and people, the in- 
comparable achievements of mankind as distinguished from all other 
forms of animal life, and many other pertinent things; but after all, 
these matters are only arguments and his questioners might readily have 
differed with him in the deductions to be drawn. The outcome of such 
a debate, with no judges to render a decision on the issue, is very fre- 
quently nothing but continuing disagreement. 

A DECLARATION OF FAITH 

But how is it with a declaration of faith? What can an opponent 
say to that ? He may say, truthfully, "I don't believe what you believe. 
I don't believe there is any proof for the assertions you make." He 
might even question the sincerity of him who makes the declaration. 
These things he could do with justification to his conscience, if that were 
his conviction and feeling, but he could go no farther. It does not lie 
within his power to know either that the subject matter of the testimony 
is not true or that he who makes the declaration does not know of 
its truth. 



38 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



The critic is confronted with a situation which he cannot meet, 
because the. knowledge which he seeks to disprove is of a realm into 
which he cannot enter by the avenue of his materialistic reasoning. If 
he is really honest and logical with himself he must retire from the 
controversy with the thought, "Maybe he does know. I have no way 
of finding out." 

SPIRITUAL EXERCISE 

That brings me to the next step in the acquisition of faith and 
testimony. This fanciful critic of ours or any other like him can find 
out, if he will, whether or not the testimony is true. This way also 
seems somewhat paradoxical. It is this : One may secure faith by doing 
the things that he would do and being the kind of a person that he 
would be if he had faith. In other words, he must repose enough con- 
fidence at the beginning of his inquiry in spiritual realities to enable 
him in faith to undertake spiritual exercise and endeavor. It is not 
enough that he try merely the form of spiritual exercise as an experiment. 
He must be truly humble. He will have to forsake the philosophy of 
self-sufficiency. He must seek believing, praying, and hoping that he 
will find. No such sincere, prayerful effort will go unrequited — that is 
the very constitution of the philosophy of faith. 

I said there must be spiritual exercise. I use this phrase purposefully 
because I believe that it connotes something that is indispensable, not 
only in obtaining faith but in perpetuating it. I do not need to argue that 
it is exercise of our faculties that brings them into usefulness and a 
higher state of perfection. This everyone will admit. How unfortunate 
it seems to some of us that so many people in the world giving full 
recognition to this generally accepted principle of human development 
decline to employ it as it pertains to spiritual welfare and progress. It 
may be that it is because there is involved a change of attitude, a change 
of philosophy, and very often very pronounced changes in manner of 
living. We can readily understand how difficult it is for many persons 
to make such changes. It is more difficult to understand how intelligent 
people can defend an unwillingness to make the effort. 

Spiritual exercise may be of either a public or private nature. All 
open participation in religious and Church activities is calculated to 
strengthen spiritual powers. Such participation is highly desirable and 
not infrequently is it regarded as the chief factor in the culmination of 
a firm testimony. It is, however, with reference to private spiritual 
exercise that I feel a very deep concern in academic life. Thinking 
processes in all institutions of higher learning, frequently undergo very 
radical changes, not always because professors or instructors intentionally 
promote such changes, but because the exposure of the mind to new 
concepts, new principles and methods very frequently brings reactions 
and complexes that are altogether unbidden by either student or teacher. 
I know that this is true because I have had such experiences myself.

39 



THOUGHTS MUST BE DISCIPLINED 

Sometimes thoughts are like unruly children — difficult to control. I 
have persuaded myself, however, that they can be disciplined and often 
they must be if we are to preserve our faith. Let me illustrate again 
with a fanciful character. He may be a student or even a professor, 
because, after all, good professors are always students. This academic 
man begins to ponder. He has studied and he has done a good deal of 
scientific thinking. He comes on to a number of perplexing questions 
with apparent incompatibility between his former conceptions of faith 
and the new things which he learns. What about the age of the earth? 
Was Adam really the first man? In the light of what he has learned 
can he still believe in the miracles as reported in the scriptures, and 
coming down to later days, can the story of the Prophet Joseph Smith 
be true? Was he really visited by heavenly beings? Did he translate 
the Book of Mormon by the power of the Lord ? Was the holy Priesthood 
actually bestowed by divine messengers? 

It is while he is contemplating such things, even though he is loath 
to let go of his once simple faith, that his thoughts spring up unbidden, 
almost belligerently, to fight down his erstwhile convictions. They heckle 
him and they challenge him. "What do you know? How much proof 
have you?" they say. "Why don't you acknowledge, in the face of 
what you have learned, that you have been the victim of a delusion?" 
And he says to himself in answer to these taunts, "I do want to be 
intellectually honest, I want to be true to myself." 

Now here is where I want to break into this conversation with 
himself. I want to ask this scholar who has a thinking complex of the 
kind which I have mentioned, this question, when he says, "I want 
to be true to myself" : "What part of yourself is it to which you want 
to be true? Is it your spiritual self or this new man of science? Is 
it that fellow who was yourself throughout your boyhood and your 
youth; whom your mother and your father nurtured so carefully and 
loved so much ; who was so confident in the goodness of things and so 
happy in his confidence ; whose pure faith held such high promise for 
his people and those who loved him?" Now if this is the part of 
yourself to whom you wish to be true, I think I can tell you what to do. 
Just say to those skeptical, disturbing, rebellious thoughts, "I propose 
to stay with my faith, with the faith of my people. I know that happiness 
and contentment are there and I forbid you, agnostic, doubting thoughts, 
to destroy the house of my faith. I acknowledge that I do not under- 
stand the processes of creation, but I accept the fact of it. I grant that 
I cannot explain the miracles of the Bible and I do not attempt to do 
so, but I accept God's word. I wasn't with Joseph, but I believe him. 
My faith did not come to me through science and I will not permit 
science to destroy it. When I change my mind about God and his work, 
only the inspiration of God will change it." 

You may think all this evasive. I urge you to try it before deciding. 
I am as proud of science and reason and their marvelous development 
as I think I should be. I love education. It is the promise of universal 



40 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



peace and progress. In the presence of a master mind, penetrating, 
logical, and luminous, I stand with an admiration that almost approaches 
reverence. I want to think, I want everyone to think, for thinking is the 
better part of study. I believe, however, our thoughts may be disciplined 
without stultification of our intelligences and with infinite peace and 
happiness to ourselves. 

A CAUTION AND PROMISE 

In conclusion, my dear young brothers and sisters, I issue to you 
another caution with a promise. I believe that an observance of it will 
be more potential than anything I have mentioned in the preservation 
of your faith. It is this : Never depart from the teachings of the Church ; 
keep every commandment, — do not be persuaded that you can violate 
any one with impunity; honor God — and I promise you you will never 
lose your faith in him. Amen. 

ELDER JOHN H. TAYLOR 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

I am very happy, my brethren and sisters, to be with you today. 

A few months ago I came across a book with the heading "What 
Can We Believe?" It is not my intention to discuss the problems 
within the book, but the reading of its statements brought to my mind 
some of the conditions that are perhaps very similar to those which we 
have in the Church. The book brings up the question of the higher 
and the lower criticism of the scriptures. It states that in about 1900 
we had what is called the lower criticism of our scriptures, and then 
later we had what was referred to as the higher criticism. 

We are quite familiar with the discussions and methods entailed 
in this type of work. The thought back of this investigation was that 
the Bible needed a certain type of explanation and correction so that 
it might be more reliable and correct because of more modern discoveries 
and methods. But because the reviewers were sometimes more con- 
cerned with the letter than they were with the spirit of the Book, there 
was created in the minds of a number of people a disbelief, or at least 
a skepticism, in the scriptures themselves. A revision of scripture is 
not necessarily wrong provided that the necessity is there and the men 
chosen are inspired by the Lord especially in the matter of doctrine 
and stated facts. 

In our anxiety to place our own scriptures, including the Bible, 
before the people, especially the young people, we will, if not very careful, 
bring about a loss of faith because as soon as we commence to analyze 
in a critical way many of its statements and make the prophets such 
very ordinary, common men in order to show reason for some of their 
statements, we arouse in the hearts and minds of men and women the 
question : "Well, what can we believe in the scriptures ?" 

I can see no objection to analyzing the scripture in a way that will 
help people understand some of its statements. But we should be careful 



ELDER JOHN H. TAYLOR 



41 



that we do not go to the extreme in our Church that other men and women 
have gone in this analysis, stressing words and losing the spirit of the 
message. The Lord has said that he spoke to his prophets and they 
wrote and spoke as they were moved upon by the Holy Ghost. 

Some explanations and change of viewpoint may be needed because 
of recent discoveries, but at the same time we must not let anyone get 
away from the thought that men were speaking and writing by the 
inspiration and power of God and that the scripture is the word of the 
Lord, and was given to us by him. 

A while ago I heard the thought expressed that the Church should 
begin a revision of the Book of Mormon because of the many apparent 
mistakes in it pertaining to the division of chapters and verses, also in 
the language and doctrine, and that through a careful, modern revision 
the book could be more easily understood and be freer from outside 
criticism. In my opinion, if we continue to move along those lines we 
may gain a little in the correctness of words but lose considerable in our 
attitude towards the book, as well as bring doubt into the thoughts of 
men and women concerning the inspiration of our sacred scriptures. 
Sometimes in our anxiety to develop faith we develop disbelief. 

Criticism may be helpful or detrimental, helpful if it increases our 
knowledge of the revealed word, detrimental when it insists on an inter- 
pretation that is not in harmony with the whole message of the book or 
the accepted doctrine of the Church. For instance, a man said to me 
the other day : "Do you know where the Lost Tribes are ?" 

I said : "Well, no, I do not know where they are." 

"Well," he said, "do you think they are at the North Pole?" 

I said: "No, I do not know if they are up at the North Pole." 

(Of course the Russians and others were flying back and forth.) 

"Do you think they are down to the South Pole ?" 

I told him, "No, I think perhaps they are not there." 

He said : "Do you think they are up in some star or some other 
place ?" 

I said : "I do not know where they are. All that I can tell you is what 
President Grant has said — that they are lost." 

"Well," he said to me, "I do not think they are lost. They are 
found." 

Then he made the explanation that they are all safely located over 
in Europe, and that they are gathering here in Zion and bringing their 
records with them. (He was referring to their genealogical records.) 
I might have argued, "I understood that the ice was going to flow down 
in their presence when they came forth." 

Likely he would have answered, "But the ice is flowing down from 
the north all the time." 

Then I thought of the idea that if Christ left his message in Jeru- 
salem, along with a written record by his disciples of his life and teach- 
ings, and then came to America and left his message here, and the Indians 
had a record and a tradition still existing among them concerning the 
visit of the Christ, undoubtedly the Lost Tribes whom Christ said he 



42 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



was going to visit would at least have a tradition about his visit among 
them and also, I believe, a written record as in the other two cases. 

Well, that thought is going the rounds. We are not satisfied to 
leave things as they are and wait for additional revelation from the Lord. 
To many it is embarrassing to talk about a lost people when to all appear- 
ances the earth has been thoroughly explored. In order to harmonize an 
apparent discrepancy, we assume an explanation instead of waiting for 
revelation on the subject. This bewilders people and makes them think 
that perhaps Joseph Smith was wrong in his statement concerning the 
Ten Tribes. 

Another criticism that I heard the other day was about the Word 
of Wisdom, which indicates how prone we are to want to debate the 
word of the Lord to the point of finding fault with the emphasis the 
Authorities of the Church place on this revelation. 

A man said, "Why is it that we preach the Word of Wisdom all 
the time? Why do we not get up-to-date and have new lines and new 
methods, new arguments for the Word of Wisdom, instead of doing 
the way we have been doing all these many years ? Why, we have been 
preaching and preaching; you never go to a meeting but what you 
hear about it, yet today there are more people in the Church using 
liquor and breaking the Word of Wisdom in other ways than we have 
ever had before." He was thus indicating that we have not been accom- 
plishing anything in the Church so far as the Word of Wisdom is 
concerned and that our methods have increased the breaking of the com- 
mandment instead of decreasing it. 

My thought in mentioning these matters is that we have so many 
things in the Church that are established by the word of the Lord and 
that are plain and easy to be understood under the Spirit and inspiration 
of the Lord, and when we try to complicate these things or the doctrines 
and principles in the Church, we only confuse the minds of men and 
women and help to destroy the very thing we are trying to build up 
in the hearts of these people. I know we have to study, we have to be 
up-to-date, we have to progress, we must not be static. But why dis- 
courage people unnecessarily in their faith in the scriptures and their 
faith in their leaders ? 

All I am trying to say is that we ought to believe and follow the 
thing that we have so plainly written for us by the servants of God, and 
when we cannot understand it because no more is written, let us be 
satisfied, and keep this faith Brother Richards has been speaking of deep 
within our hearts and be willing to accept it until God in his wisdom and 
mercy someday makes things more plain to us. 

May the Lord bless us and help us to do this, I pray in Jesus' name. 
Amen. 

BISHOP SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 

Presiding Bishop of the Church 

I rejoice, my brethren and sisters, in being present with you at this 
important Conference. I have enjoyed the spirit of this meeting and 



BISHOP SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 43 



trust that which I shall say may prove profitable and faith-promoting to 
everyone present. 

I was impressed in listening to President Grant this morning, and 
desire to state that I am unqualifiedly in support of the statement he 
made relative to that which is expected of us. I am grateful to the 
Lord for the faith that I have in the principles of the Gospel and my 
desire to live in accordance with every principle of the Gospel. 

I was interested, also, in his very interesting description of his 
visit to Europe and the various meetings held throughout the nations of 
that part of the world. It brought back memories to me of two missions 
that I fulfilled over in Europe, comprising about five years, between 
thirty and thirty-eight years ago. 

LARGER CROPS AND BETTER PRICES 

I am happy to be with you under such favorable conditions. I am 
grateful for the improvement generally in our temporal circumstances. 
As you realize, the past season in this intermountain country has been 
very favorable from a climatic standpoint, which is a very important 
factor in our temporal progress. The result has been that the crops 
generally speaking, throughout the. intermountain country, and I think 
probably throughout the nation at large, have been bounteous. Like- 
wise, better prices have been obtained. 

The fact is that those who are engaged in farming are profitably 
enjoying the fruits of their labors. In my judgment, the prosperity of 
this nation, or any nation, depends, in very large measure, upon the 
prices of farm products, upon the availability of fertile farm lands, and, 
also, upon favorable climatic conditions. 

EFFECT OF FARM PRODUCTS PRICES ON ECONOMIC CONDITIONS 

As I examine the economic charts for this country, covering a long 
period of time, I note that whenever the prices of farm product's have 
been good prosperity has prevailed, and when farm products prices have 
been low depression has generally prevailed. Prosperity has not been 
dependent primarily upon wages, but apparently, as an important factor, 
upon fair prices for the farm crops. Therefore, I think it is important, 
so far as possible, taking into account the laws of supply and demand 
and the fact that farmers do not control crop production, to strive to 
maintain fair prices. It does not appear to be possible in agriculture, 
to regulate production to the same extent that it is practicable to do in 
industry, and in the handling of commercial undertakings. The natural 
tendency of those engaged in agriculture is, when any product yields 
good prices one year, to plant larger crops the following year, with a 
consequent drop in prices. Whatever can be done reasonably to regulate 
supply to conform to demand should be done. 

WAGES AND INDUSTRIAL PROGRESS 

There is no particular need to be concerned about wages. Wages 
tend to follow general economic conditions. When times are prosperous, 



44 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



the wage level rises steadily. When depressions occur, they follow 
the trend.- Where efforts are widely made to force wages up beyond 
reasonable limits, commercial and industrial development is adversely 
affected. On the other hand, there are instances where employers take 
advantage of their workers and fail to give them a fair return for their 
efforts. This, also, interferes with economic progress. The more nearly 
commodity prices, in general, can be maintained at what is considered 
a normal level, the better and more stable will be the economic status. 
Commodity prices tend to increase, naturally, with the increase in the 
amount and velocity of money in circulation, and to .decrease with the 
improvement in efficiency of production, the increase in volume of trade, 
and the growth in population. We are very fortunate, at the present 
time, under the favorable conditions which prevail in industry as well as 
in agriculture. Whether the general rise in prices is a natural economic 
. improvement, or whether it is caused artificially, in part, by the large 
amount of Federal funds in circulation, remains to be seen. Likewise, 
the causes of recent financial disturbance are not clear. 

IMPROVEMENT IN FINANCIAL CONDITIONS 

I rejoice in reporting to you that the tithes of the Church for the 
first six months of this year show an increase over the same period 
of last year, and that last year's tithes showed a material increase over 
the year before. This is an index of the financial condition of Church 
members. Likewise, the number of tithepayers has increased, and cor- 
respondingly with the growth of the Church, the number of those who 
should pay tithing has increased. On the average, there are about 25 % 
of the membership of the Church who pay their tithing. There are about 
15% in addition who should, but who do not pay tithing. This is a field 
for encouragement and the teaching of the principle of tithing by Church 
officers., to those members of the Church who have not shown the faith 
necessary to observe the principle of tithing. There are those who have 
paid donations who have not really paid a tithing. They have given 
their donations of what we call a part tithing, and yet have not had the 
spiritual strength and the unselfishness to be willing to give that tenth 
which the Lord expects of his children, for the advancement and ful- 
fillment of his promises and purposes unto his people. 

RESPONSIBILITIES OF CHURCH OFFICERS 

Great responsibilities rest upon all the officers throughout the 
Church. They are not occupying places of responsibility because of 
any personal or selfish desires. They have been selected because of 
their willingness to serve and for their diligence. They are engaged in 
this work because they are assured that it is the work of the Lord. They 
are as watchmen upon the towers to safeguard the spiritual welfare and 
progress of the people. It is their duty to teach and counsel the members 
to observe all the revelations of the Lord, and to perform all functions 
pertaining to their duties. When they teach tithing or any other divine 



BISHOP SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 45 



principle they know that those who obey shall receive the blessings of 
God, and that his purposes shall be most fully accomplished. Heavy 
demands are made upon the Presidency of the Church for funds to carry 
out all the things that are desirable and necessary for the building up 
of this Church at home and abroad — the great missionary work, the work 
of religious education, the construction and maintenance of Church 
buildings, the relief needs, the Church Security Program, and all 
of the other important matters needing attention. This work grows 
by the individual and collective service given by all the members, 
and by the observance of the divine commandments which are magnified 
by the Lord for the achievement of his plans. There is no occasion 
for us to boast about the progress that is being made in this great work. 
But there is every reason for us all to be profoundly grateful and 
appreciative of the wonderful manner in which the Lord is bringing to 
pass his purposes. And we need to manifest our gratitude by increased 
faith in every principle of the Gospel and greater activity in his cause. 

FASTING AND FAST DONATIONS 

Further, you will remember 'that in Conference eighteen months 
ago, instructions were given and a request made by the First Presidency 
that all members of the Church faithfully observe the monthly Fast, and 
give the equivalent in value for the benefit of those in need. It was 
shown that the equivalent of two meals would amount to at least ten 
cents per month for every member. The request was for a donation of 
not less than one dollar per year for every man, woman and child in 
the Church. There has been considerable improvement in this respect, 
but we have not reached the goal as yet which is expected of every one 
of us. For the past six months, the reports show an increase of 53% 
in the Fast offerings over the same period of last year. The number 
who have paid Fast offerings has increased about 31%. Apparently, 
then, since there has not been a proportionate increase in the number 
who have donated, those who have paid, have given more. Here is an 
opportunity for Church officers to encourage those who have not done 
their part, to fulfill this duty also. The average Fast offerings per 
capita paid for the first six months is 21.6 cents ; whereas it should be at 
least 50 cents. When we realize how efficiently these donations are 
applied directly for the benefit of those in need, we should all be ready 
and willing to do our full share, and thereby get the spiritual blessings 
that attend the principle of Fasting. 

I need scarcely repeat the fact that the Fast offering is a donation 
that should not cost us one cent, because if we observe the principle 
we do not sacrifice anything but the eating of food for two meals ; and 
the value of those two meals is represented by the amount that we give 
for Fast offering; so one dollar per capita per year does not represent 
fully what the members of the Church would consume i'f they did not 
Fast and did not observe this donation.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



STATISTICS ON RELIEF 

There was disbursed during the six months period to those in need, 
through the regular channels, a total of practically $300,000, which 
. includes $116,015 from Fast offerings, $102,238 from the tithes, $22,494 
from Relief Society donations, and some $58,534 from other sources, 
including $15,648 through the Church Security Program. This total 
is an increase of 97% over the amount distributed for the needy in the 
same period of 1936. The number of persons assisted on direct relief 
was 16,163 and those helped on work relief was 8,110. This is an 
increase over the previous year of 51%. As of June 30 it appears that 
there were 1,912 persons over 18 needing employment. Of this total 
it appears that about 86% were unskilled and 14% skilled. The number 
taken off County Relief during six months was 600. 

CHURCH BUILDING PROGRAM 

Another program of great importance that is going forward steadily 
is that of the building and renovating of ward, stake and mission build- 
ings, seminaries, institutes, temples, and hospitals. During the past 
months there has been expended directly from Church funds something 
over $800,000. There is a great demand at the present time for new 
buildings, improvements, repairs and remodeling of buildings, both 
for the various wards and the seminaries. If we take into ac- 
count the amount raised by the wards as their portion, there has 
been expended thus far this year for that purpose approximately 
$1,300,000. There have been 192 buildings under construction and 
remodeling. Every effort has been made to expend this money carefully, 
economically, and with the desire to obtain the best results possible for 
the money expended, and to provide the facilities that are needed for 
the welfare of the people. Taking this into account you can understand 
that care must be exercised and proper control must be had in everything 
done in this department as well as in every other department, in order 
that not one dollar shall be spent extravagantly, or unnecessarily, for 
the improvement of these facilities that are necessary for the progress 
and welfare of the Church. 

TRAINING IN BUILDING CONSTRUCTION 

The people are making great sacrifices. We are endeavoring to train 
apprentices in connection with building projects in the various localities 
so that through practice and under proper supervision they may gradu- 
ally qualify in the various crafts for future building operations. 

You will realize that in the construction of buildings a very small 
proportion of the cost is for unskilled labor. The large proportion of 
the labor cost is paid to those who are skilled men in various trades. We 
have fallen behind the conditions that prevailed in the early history of 
the Church in these various communities. Then there were many skilled 
artisans, men who could build, who knew their crafts thoroughly, who 



BISHOP SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 47 



had been trained largely in European countries. We were learning then 
to use the hand as well as the head, to a much larger extent than we are 
learning today. It is a challenge to our young people, especially to our 
young men, in the various communities of the Church to qualify to build 
the houses and other buildings that are necessary in their growth. We 
would like to be able to encourage the wards in such a way that they may 
be able to furnish all necessary labor for their projects ; but the fact 
that so few are prepared to qualify to do the skilled part of the work is 
one of the hindrances and difficulties that stand in the way. 

COUNTING THE COST 

One of the things we are telling the brethren in the various wards 
is that sometimes in their haste and in their enthusiasm to go forward 
with any project they forget the lesson contained in a parable used 
by the Savior. We are employing it rather literally. I would like to read 
it to you : 

For which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down first, 
and counteth the cost, whether he have sufficient to finish it? 

Lest haply, after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able to finish 
it, all that behold it begin to mock him, 

Saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish. (Luke 
14:28-30.) 

Within the last few years the borrowing of money for the construc- 
tion of Church buildings has been stopped. In addition we have been 
endeavoring to get the people to pay their ward debts, with the result 
that, in spite of unfavorable economic conditions, these debts have been 
steadily reduced year by year, until now they are only about 30% of the 
original amounts. You will realize how important it is that the' wards be 
prepared to undertake to do their part of the building when it is author- 
ized, so that they may not be held up or forced to stop for a period during 
its construction. In one or two instances, such a condition has prevailed. 
It is very unfortunate. Almost identically these words of the Savior 
have been expressed by people who have passed such buildings and seen 
them unfinished. They have ridiculed those persons responsible for 
failure to adequately prepare for the undertaking. 

So it is a challenge to us all to be thoroughly prepared when we 
undertake anything in life to carry through to a successful conclusion 
and in conformity with our plans. In this connection, I would like 
to call your attention to other instructions which the Savior gave in 
connection with this parable : 'Whosoever doth not bear his cross, and 
come after me, cannot be my disciple." (Luke 14:27) And again, "No 
man, having put his hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for the 
Kingdom of God." (Luke 9:62) Therefore, when we undertake to put 
our hands to the plow as disciples of the Lord, Jesus Christ, we must count 
the cost, and prepare ourselves to go forward throughout our lives in his 
service if we expect to gain the blessings and benefits which come from 
membership in his Church, and adherence to his principles, as they have 
been revealed unto us.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



I pray that the Lord may help every one of us to sense these things 
and to learn these lessons that will help us and our children, — our young 
people, — to learn the foundation of faith, to develop understanding of 
faith, to seek and gain that faith in God which will enable them to 
be true to every principle of the Gospel and go forward and serve the 
Lord with full purpose of heart, which I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

An anthem, "Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty" (Gounod) was sung

PERILOUS TIMES 

We are living in perilous times. The conditions in many parts of 
the world are as uncertain and disturbed as they could be without armed 
conflict. Spain is involved in civil war at the present time. That is not 
far from where the Savior of the world lived in mortality, where the 
Gospel of peace was preached by him and his disciples, and where thou- 
sands of people undoubtedly heard the truth from the lips of the Master 
himself or from those whom he sent when he told them to go into all 
the world and preach the Gospel to every creature, and they that believed 
and were baptized would be saved and they that believed not would be 
damned. Nearly two thousand years have passed since that warning was 
delivered and the great majority of the inhabitants of the earth are not 
yet converted to the message of love, but the destructive power of the 
adversary intensifies as the years roll by. 

I stand before you exceedingly nervous, realizing what a responsi- 
bility is mine, and pray for the inspiration of the Lord that we may 
all be edified by what we hear and feel. 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH

REPENTANCE AND HUMILITY NEEDED 

As we analyze the situation we must come to the conclusion that 
there never was a time in the world's history when there was greater 
necessity everywhere for men to repent of their sins and seek the guidance 
of our Heavenly Father. There has never been a time since the Church 
was organized when there was greater need for us to humble ourselves 
before the Lord and seek his guidance. 

There are many people who think themselves competent to lead us 
out of our difficulties and without hesitation they come forward with 
suggestions to try this or that as an experiment. And yet our Heavenly 
Father has advised us that the only plan that will produce satisfactory 
results and take us back into his presence is the plan of eternal life, 
the Gospel of Jesus Christ, as advocated by his beloved Son. 

The wisdom of the world is not sufficient. What we need in the 
midst of our distresses is the wisdom of our Heavenly Father. And 
how shall we obtain it? Will it be by selfishness? I think not. Will 
we obtain it by arrogance, unmindful of the rights of others? Certainly 
not. Will we obtain it by fault finding and criticizing those who are 
seeking unselfishly to bless mankind? No, never. The Lord has told 
us that we may obtain the inspiration that we always need by living 
righteous lives and by .prayer and thanksgiving. He has said that when 
even two or three shall meet together in his name he will be there to 
bless them. This great audience of thousands of people has met in the 
name of the Lord and I have no doubt that he will bless us. 

This is a glorious autumn day. Outside the sun is shining, birds are 
singing, flowers are blooming, and inside this great Tabernacle there is 
peace and quiet and the spirit of worship. With all my heart I feel 
to thank my Heavenly Father that I am here. 

THE PATHWAY TO THE CELESTIAL KINGDOM 

The Lord, when he placed our first parents on the earth, gave them 
instructions and from time to time he has sent his prophets to counsel 
their descendants. We have in the Old and the New Testament the teach- 
ings of the Lord, not of man, but the advice of our Heavenly Father 
intended to direct us along the pathway that will eventually terminate 
in the celestial kingdom. How wonderful it is to know that there is 
a pathway leading to a glorious kingdom. 

The Ten Commandments given to ancient Israel are a guide to 
safety and eternal happiness. Whenever we violate any of them we 
are not in the narrow way. We are told that strait is the gate and 
narrow the way which leadeth unto life, and if we would be in that narrow 
way we must keep his commandments. 

When Jesus of Nazareth was upon the earth he pleaded with men 
to live righteous lives in preparation for immortality, and he gave his 
life, demonstrating that he was not afraid to die and that the resurrec- 
tion was a reality, and after he was raised from the dead he continued 
to advise the people how to live and when they have followed that advice 



50 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



they have rejoiced in the blessings of mortal life and in the assurance 
of eternal life. 

THE PRICE OF PEACE AND HAPPINESS 

The Book of Mormon tells us that there was one long period of 
time when the people were righteous and that was the two hundred 
years after the appearance of our Savior on this western hemisphere. 
They repented of their sins, turned to the Lord and were prosperous 
and happy. 

When the Gospel of Jesus Christ was established in this dispensation 
the Lord repeated what he has said so many times in the Old and New 
Testaments, that the price of peace and happiness is righteousness. 
Notwithstanding that knowledge there are many who appear to think 
that we can obtain happiness in some other way but we should all know 
by this time that there is no other way and only sorrow and disappoint- 
ment will result from disobeying the Father of our spirits. We live 
in a day when there are. many temptations to evil and each one who 
submits himself to any of them loses a blessing. 

The Prophet Joseph Smith received a revelation from our Heavenly 
Father called the Word of Wisdom in which we are advised not to use 
stimulants and narcotics. There are some among us who ignore the 
advice given in that revelation and drink liquor and use tobacco, knowing 
that the penalty must be paid and the blessing forfeited that would follow 
obedience. Why is it that it is so difficult for some people to comprehend 
that there is no happiness or benefit in violating the wise counsel of our 
Heavenly Father ? 

He has taught us that we must observe the Sabbath Day to keep 
it holy. One day of the seven he has set apart as his day, and in considera- 
tion of all his blessings bestowed upon us on the other days it would 
appear to me that we ought to find joy in doing the things that he asks 
us to do on his holy day, and I believe that unless we do we will find 
no happiness that is worthy of the name. He wants us to be happy and 
has told us how we may earn that happiness. 

FLYING IN A FOG 

One day I boarded an airplane at Los Angeles. It was foggy and 
they held us on the ground for some time, but finally word came that 
we might start. The plane taxied down the field, left the ground, soared 
up into the air and ascended above the fog into glorious sunshine. We 
could see the top of a mountain that gave the pilot our direction toward 
Salt Lake City. 

We were soon crossing Nevada. The view from the plane was de- 
lightful. Near Milford, Utah, we suddenly flew into one of the worst 
fogs I have ever seen. I tried to look out of the window of the plane 
but could not see anything through the fog. Not a thing could be seen 
in any direction outside the plane. 

I knew that we were approaching the mountains at the approximate 
rate of three miles a minute, that we were compelled to pass over them 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 



51 



to get into the Salt Lake Valley. I was worried and asked myself, "How 
can the pilot find the way when he cannot see a thing ?" He had his 
compass but the plane might drift off its course. He had instruments 
indicating our distance above sea level but he had no way of knowing 
how far we were from the ground. I thought he might fly high enough to 
clear the mountains between us and the Salt Lake Valley and try to 
find the landing field by the flash of the beacons if we got close enough, 
but I chilled when I thought of the danger of losing our way and missing 
the beacons and the airport. 

AN ELECTRIC HIGHWAY 

In my anxiety I went up into the space that was occupied by the 
pilot and the co-pilot to see how they knew where we were going. I 
could not tell whether we were a hundred feet, a thousand feet or ten 
thousand feet above the ground and I did not know how they could tell, 
except approximately. I noticed that the pilot had a little device over 
his ear like operators in telephone offices use to receive with. I inquired 
of the co-pilot how they could tell whether we were flying in the right 
direction or know if we were off course. He replied, "When we cannot 
see we are guided by the radio beam." "What is that?" I asked.. He 
explained that the beam might be likened to an electric highway between 
two points and in our case the points were Milford and Salt Lake City. 
He said that the device over the pilot's ear operated so that when the 
plane was in the beam a low, purring sound continued to be heard, but 
if the plane goes to the right or left the sound changes and the pilot is 
warned by a clicking as of a telegraph key. If he hears two dots and a 
dash he knows he is leaving the beam to the right; if two dashes and a 
dot he is leaving the beam to the left and he immediately pulls back 
to the beam or highway, on to the path of safety, the clicking ceases and 
the purring resumes. If we continue on the beam we will arrive at our 
destination in safety. 

' I returned to my seat greatly comforted to know that notwithstand- 
ing we were enveloped in fog and darkness and could neither see nor feel 
where we were the pilot was receiving information constantly that we were 
on the highway and he knew that we would soon arrive at our destination. 
A few minutes later I felt the plane descending. We had passed over 
the mountain tops and were nearing the airport. When we were nearly 
down we could see the powerful lights of the field indicating where to 
land and the plane with its precious cargo touched the ground gently 
as a seagull lights on water, slowly came to a stop and we stepped 
from our conveyance to the ground, happy to be at home again. 

Not long after the trip I have described to you another passenger 
plane flying from Los Angeles to Salt Lake over the same course became 
lost in the darkness. For some unknown reason the pilot failed to 
follow the radio beam. They crashed on a granite peak about twenty-five 
miles south of here and it was months before any of th; bodies were 
recovered. 



52 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



FOLLOWING THE CHARTED COURSE 

I have thought many times of the lesson I learned on the plane and 
have applied it to experience in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints. We are passengers on the good ship Zion. Jesus Christ, 
our Lord, is the real pilot. He charted the course; he knows every 
island and rock on the way and has placed beacons to guide us safely 
to our destination. 

Notwithstanding the fact that we are members of his Church we 
will not obtain an inheritance in the celestial kingdom except on condition 
that we follow the course that he has charted. Each of the Ten Com- 
mandments is a beacon warning us of danger. The Word of Wisdom 
is a beacon for our guidance and protection, as are all the counsels of the 
Lord to us. If we are living as we know that we should we are entitled 
to the whispering of a still small voice calling attention to danger saying 
this is the pathway of safety, walk ye in it. We are not in that pathway 
when we profane, when we disobey the Lord's command to keep the 
Sabbath Day holy or when we are unjust to one another. If we have 
erred in our conduct the voice will whisper to us "turn back, you have 
made a mistake; you have disregarded the advice of your Heavenly 
Father." Turn from the error of your way while there is yet time, for 
if you go too far from the right path you will not hear the voice and 
you may be hopelessly lost and be wrecked, even as the pilot and his 
precious cargo were when they lost their way. 

Because of his love for us our Savior has done everything to protect 
us from the effects of evil, even to the giving of his life, but he will 
not take from us our agency. 

As members of this Church we may not excuse ourselves as the 
people of the world may who have not been properly taught and do 
not understand. Millions of God's children have not charts and compass 
as we have, but he organized his Church and offers membership and 
invites all to come into it and to be with him on the good ship Zion, with 
the promise that in obedience to his commandments there will -flow 
peace, happiness and eternal life in his celestial kingdom. 

Shall we be careless ? Shall we use things which God has forbidden ? 
Shall we dishonor his holy day ? Shall we neglect our prayers ? Shall we 
take advantage of our neighbors ? Shall we do the things that the Lord 
has told us not to do, when we know that by so conducting ourselves 
we may lose his spirit and we ourselves be lost ? 

THE PILOT OF THE CHURCH 

Not only has the Lord given us the advice already recorded in the 
scriptures to guide us but he has placed as a leader in this Church, one 
of his sons who has been chosen and ordained and set apart to be 
the President. He is our pilot and he will be directed by a voice that 
will enable him to lead us where we should go. If we are wise we 
will not set up our judgment against him but will be happy to honor 
him in his place as long as the Lord sustains him. We have had 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 



53 



misguided souls in the Church who have, in their ignorance, opposed 
the advice of the pilot, not sensing the fact that they were opposing 
the Lord and they have fallen into darkness and sorrow, and unless 
they repent they will not find a place in the celestial kingdom. 

Let us remember that the President of this Church has been offi- 
cially designated as the pilot of the Church here in mortality to represent 
the Master of heaven and earth. 

THE PATHWAY TO PEACE 

My advice to you is to get the Spirit of God and keep it and the 
only way we will retain it is by living near him, by keeping his com- 
mandments and in these days of uncertainty when men are running to 
and fro seeking for some new plan by which peace may be brought into 
the world know this that the only way to peace for this world is the 
pathway of the Gospel of Jesus Christ our Lord. There is no other. We 
have the instruments to operate the ship. We have the information 
including a map with every danger charted and if we will go forward 
day by day rejoicing in the companionship of one another, winning by 
our upright lives the love and confidence of our families and neighbors 
until the time comes when we have completed the period assigned to us 
here we will arrive at our heavenly home and be made welcome by our 
Heavenly Father. To possess a knowledge of the truth is worth all the 
wealth of the world, to know that we are on the safe highway when we 
are in the pathway of duty as defined by our Heavenly Father, and to 
know that we can continue there if we will, regardless of the influences 
and inducements that may be offered by those who have not been ap- 
pointed to be our leaders, is a blessing that is priceless. 

AVOIDING THE PITFALLS 

God bless you, my brethren, who are presidents of stakes and 
bishops of wards, you who preside over quorums, you who are called 
to take charge in the auxiliary organizations, both men and women. Be 
humble and prayerful, that you may avoid the pitfalls that the adversary 
prepares for your feet. Listen to the still small voice that will always 
direct you if you are worthy of it in a path that means eternal happiness. 
My soul is filled with gratitude this day to know that as we continue our 
membership in the Church we do have a pilot who knows the way, and 
if we will follow his direction we will not land on the side of the mountain 
to be crushed nor descend to the depths to be drowned ; we will not meet 
the spiritual disasters that the world is meeting but we will go about 
doing good, blessing mankind, and rejoicing in the companionship of 
those we love. 

That the Lord will -continue to bless the man who stands at the 
head of this Church together with his counselors and those that associate 
with them, that they may be inspired to see eye to eye in righteousness, and 
that we who are members may be wise enough not to jump overboard 
but that we may stay with the good ship Zion as it follows its course 



54 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



and help keep that course where the Lord would have it to be to the 
end that we may all find our place in the celestial kingdom when our 
labors in mortality are completed, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

We have thirteen returned presidents of missions from whom we 
have not heard in one of our Conference sessions. We have brethren 
presiding over missions who have not yet spoken, and those who are 
presiding in the mission field who have spoken in these Conferences, 
numbering fourteen ; so that as usual we have not time sufficient to hear 
from every one from whom we would like to hear. We shall not call 
on mission presidents who will have an opportunity later to speak to 
us in Conf erence, and will call on those only who have been released 
and are with us. We shall ask them, as there are thirteen of them, 
not to exceed ten minutes in their remarks. There is a clock directly 
in front of them — I have been looking at that clock now for fifty-odd 
years, and I have always been able to see it — and I should like the brethren 
to remember that every time they exceed their time, some one will have 
less than his share of time. If they should accidentally stop a minute 
too soon there will be no complaint. 

ELDER DON B. COLTON 

Former President of the Eastern States Mission 

During the last four years I have had the wonderful experience of 
laboring as a missionary in and president of the Eastern States Mission. 
That experience has been the most satisfactory of my life. I appreciate 
it sincerely. 

Soon after reaching the mission field we dedicated the Washington 
chapel. It has been one of the main centers since then for the advance- 
ment and for the preaching the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. We 
have built and dedicated other chapels, and I feel that the mission 
in a material way has made substantial progress. We are building a 
chapel now in Philadelphia. 

One of the outstanding developments of that period has been the 
work at the Hill Cumorah where the Church has erected a beautiful and 
impressive monument and has also erected a Bureau of Information. 
During the last summer, an open air theatre has been erected. I mention 
these only in appreciation of the fine work that has been accomplished 
in creating and providing for us the agencies that are so necessary in 
aid of the preaching of the Gospel. 

The finest experience, however, that has come to me has been the 
opportunity of- working with the groups of fine young men and women 
who have come into the mission field from the various wards and branches 
and stakes of Zion and other missions. They have been an inspiration to 
me, and if Mormonism may be judged by its fruits, we are not ashamed 



ELDER DON B. COLTON

to have people know that these boys and girls represent the homes of 
the Mormon Church. 

I should like to say a word to my brethren, the Bishops. Thank 
the Lord for a Bishop who can find work for his returned missionaries, 
particularly in the work of the Church. I rejoice also in this great move- 
ment to provide work for our people. I can endorse fully the words 
uttered by the President yesterday morning. Most of our boys and 
girls who return are anxious to work. I pray that the Lord will open 
the way and help them that they may find employment. In the main 
they return full of the spirit of the Gospel, fine, clean young people. I 
hope that they shall not become discouraged nor soured in life. They 
have learned the greatest lesson of life, namely, that God lives. Their 
hearts have been warmed and their souls attuned to the Spirit of God. 
They have seen life in a different way. I hope that they shall not be 
disappointed, but shall find a place in the world and continue to make 
good. 

And now, just one word with reference to the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ. In the papers the other day it was announced that several noted 
divines had made the statement that during the last two thousand years 
Christianity had been failing. With all due respect, I cannot subscribe 
to that doctrine. Christianity has not failed. The failure, if any, has 
been due to the fact that people have not interpreted Christianity properly 
and have not lived it. God does not fail ; his works do not fail ; they 
succeed. God succeeds ; man only fails when he does not interpret the 
word of God correctly, and does not translate it into his own life. 

The evidence, therefore, clearly shows that during these two thousand 
years whatever failure has come has been due to men not accepting true 
Christianity. So, my brethren and sisters, the last four years have 
taught me that there is in the world a true Christianity, and I say this 
humbly and without the spirit of boasting. I recognize that good men 
and good women everywhere are trying to live Christianity, as they 
understand it, but the fact that it has not succeeded ought to be notice 
to them that somewhere along the line they have missed the charted 
course of the Gospel of Christ. 

I bear solemn testimony that there is a Christianity in the world that 
takes hold of the lives of men and women and makes them over, so to 
speak; that turns them from the paths of unrighteousness into the paths 
of truth and rectitude, and that God is directing the work of his Church. 
The Christianity that recognizes that everywhere the Gospel is in the 
world for the world's good, and that men and women who embrace it are 
" made better. So far as it is translated into their lives there is no failure, 
and when we find that it is failing, let us look to ourselves or to the 
doctrines that we have embraced. God's work is right. His truth never 
fails. It is always right. God is always right. May we seek to find 
his light and may we walk therein. I do know as I know that I live 
that God lives. It is the most precious thing in my life. I rejoice 
beyond my power to express that there has come to me the overwhelming 
conviction that Jesus Christ is the Savior of the world, the only name

given under heaven whereby we must be saved. I rejoice that his truth 
has been restored, and pray that God will help us to live it always, in 
the name of Jesus, our Savior, Amen. 

ELDER NICHOLAS G. SMITH 

Former President of the California Mission 

My brethren and sisters, I am happy to stand before you this 
morning and bear testimony to the divinity of the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ. I love our Church because of the opportunity it gives each 
of us to do unselfish service. 

I spent the most glorious two and a half years of my life in the 
California Mission, and recently returned from that mission loving 
it and loving the people there. To associate with your boys and 
girls in the mission field, to see them grow and develop in their 
testimonies and in their ability to mix with other' people and to 
convince them of the truth of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, was a 
great joy. 

California is a great country — the land of sunshine they call it. 
I love it, not because of its sunshine, but because of the people who 
are there. Goodness knows that had I been seeking sunshine I 
would not have needed to go away from Salt Lake City in August 
and September of this year. 

Since coming here I have been assigned to a new task, to labor 
as a counselor to President Stephen L. Chipman in the Salt Lake 
Temple, and I have been surprised at the things I have discovered 
there. Do you know we have some sixty thousand names that have 
been sent into the temple from the mission fields of the world that 
should be taken care of and. the work done for them? The President 
of the French Mission wrote to me and told me that he had sent in 
some lists of names — several hundred — two years ago and had not 
yet received the papers back, and he desired to know whether the 
names had been lost. When I looked into the files I discovered that 
not only those from the French Mission were there, but there were 
thousands and thousands from other missions that were there wait- 
ing to be taken care of. I feel it would be a glorious thing if the 
people would consider this great work, this charity work, that is to 
be done for the missions of the world, and when they come to the 
House of the Lord take the names from some of these missions and 
help us to clear them out of the files. I hope the new Security Plan 
will work out this very thing. 

I was astonished to learn that for the month of August the 
temples ran about 29% capacity; that is, we could have done 71% 
more work in the Salt Lake Temple than was done during the 
month of August; and I am wondering how temple-conscious we 
are, and whether or not we should not consider this great mission 
that all of us have been called to that are in the Church. You will 
remember that the Prophet bore down heavily upon this one point — 



ELDER NICHOLAS G. SMITH 



57 



that we cannot be made perfect without our dead — and assigned to 
us a special activity, a missionary work if you please, and while 
I will candidly admit that up until now this missionary work has 
not been so interesting to me as the missionary work for the living 
has been, I recognize the fact that it is essential, it is a work that 
all of us should be thinking about ; and I hope that throughout the 
winter months the Salt Lake Temple and all the temples will be 
running one hundred per cent capacity, instead of 29%. 

God bless the Latter-day Saints. Wherever I have been amongst 
our people I have found that they were living the Gospel, and their 
example has been a strength and a help to me, for their homes have 
been opened, and I have been fed and clothed and blessed through 
the Saints. 

May the peace of our Heavenly Father be in the hearts of each 
and every one of us, and may our desire be to uphold the General 
Authorities of the Church in all that they do, is my prayer, in Jesus' 
name. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH QUINNEY, JR. 

President of the Logan Temple 

My dear brethren and -sisters: This is a surprise to me, to be 
asked to say a few words to you. I sincerely pray that God my 
eternal Father will bless the words I shall say so that they will be of 
truth and benefit not only to myself, but to you to whom I shall 
speak. 

It has been my privilege to serve the Church as a missionary 
four different times in different parts of the world. Each time I 
have responded to the call has brought joy and satisfaction and given 
me an increased testimony concerning the divinity of this great and 
mighty work. 

I have now been called into a new division of the Gospel of our 
Lord and Master Jesus Christ — to preside over the Logan Temple. 
It is a very important calling, one of trust and confidence and I 
appreciate it beyond measure. It is indeed a blessing. It is our 
aim, our objective, to beautify life both from a physical and a spirit- 
ual point of view. Inasmuch as my present calling has so much to 
do with the development of spirituality, I discover that it requires 
more concentration, more thought, more prayer and more humility 
to understand the significance of the saving graces of the Gospel of 
our Lord and Master Jesus Christ. This temple work reaches back 
to the beginning of time and touches the life of every human soul 
and gives him an opportunity to embrace the Gospel. 

It has been my privilege during my entire life to associate with 
young men and women, and one of the joys connected with this 
association has been to witness the growth and development that 
take place in the hearts and the minds of these fine young men and 
women. Many of them are occupying positions of great responsi- 



58 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



bility in the wards and stakes of Zion. They are measuring up to 
their responsibilities in a way that not only brings them into great 
prominence, but also brings credit to the cause that they represent. 
I believe in the youth of our Church. I believe that the great ma- 
jority of them who have been in the mission fields carry a testimony 
concerning the restored Gospel. 

We have had excursions of returned missionaries many times 
visiting the Logan Temple, doing work not' only for themselves but 
their kindred dead. It is glorious indeed to meet them. It has been 
my privilege to marry many of them for time and for all eternity, and 
I am convinced that those who assume this obligation in the 
Temples of God and remain true and firm to the covenants they 
have made with their Eternal Father are fine members of the Church 
and are contributing to its development and growth. 

Gratitude, my brethren and sisters, is just a little more than 
thankfulness, and I often feel as I approach my Heavenly Father 
in prayer that I not only thank him for his goodness and the many 
manifestations of his blessings and for the benefits that have come 
to me from time to time, but there is also a deep feeling of gratitude 
that comes into my heart concerning my relationship to him. 

I know that this is the work of God. I know Jesus is the Christ, 
and that Joseph Smith was the instrumentality through which God 
operated in bringing to pass the saving graces of the Gospel in this 
day and time in which we live. I humbly pray that in our lives we 
shall be able to place such interpretations upon these precious truths 
that we shall always find ourselves upholding and sustaining those 
who have been called to lead this great work, President Grant and 
his counselors and the quorum of the Twelve, and all those who are 
leading the different wards and stakes of Zion. I leave my humble 
testimony, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER ROY A. WELKER 

Former President of the German- Austrian Mission 

Once upon a time I was asked to give a toast, and the toastmaster 
said: "In front of you is a green light. When that green light flashes 
on, you are to stop." My excuse was that I was color blind and did not 
know when the green light was to be flashed. I have no excuse this 
morning, however, so I will try to stop within the range of ten minutes. 

A little over three years ago, I with my family left Salt Lake City 
for Germany, where I went to preside over the German-Austrian Mission. 
I knew at that time there was a tremendous task to be performed ; con- 
ditions were uncertain, many of the Elders were feeling that perhaps 
they would be banished, or that war would soon break out or some other 
conditions would prevail by which they would be called home. 

But conditions began to settle down and before many months they 
had tremendously improved. We saw then an opportunity to work 
harder than we had been working or the Elders had been working. We 



ELDER ROY A. WELKER 59 



did our best to make friends with the officers of the German government, 
both in a general as well as a local way. We discovered that they were 
in a transition period themselves, and feeling their way along. Many 
of their regulations were private laws that were being passed nearly 
every day by the Diet, and there was a group of police regulations that 
was never published.- 

These were the conditions that gave us greatest anxiety. In various 
cities police were given power to act under given circumstances. We 
soon found that it was our business to make friends with these local 
authorities and not to ask them whether we could do this or that, but 
to do everything that seemed reasonable to us, and if we were forbidden 
to do that again, we would make our excuses and go about doing some- 
thing else. It worked out very well. 

We also played strongly upon our twelfth Article of Faith, declaring 
that we meant it when we said that we believed in sustaining and up- 
holding the government. They seemed to believe us, for there were 
something like thirty-four small religious denominations forbidden in 
that country, and yet we went on doing work that others who like us 
were not forbidden, could not do. 

There is a law in Germany that the small religious denominations 
should not scatter their literature from door to door. We debated for 
a long while whether we should stop tracting, but we had been tracting ; 
in most of the places we had never ceased tracting, and we felt that 
inasmuch as we had been doing it we would continue, and we did continue. 
And in only a few places were we prevented from tracting, and in only 
a few places are the Elders forbidden to tract now. 

As President Grant said yesterday, in Berlin we may advertise our 
meetings freely. 

I rejoice to be able to testify to you today that the testimony of 
President Grant in the city of Berlin left a wonderful influence upon 
the people who attended that meeting. The newspapers that had refused 
us the opportunity of printing matter concerning us for a long time 
before, themselves wrote up articles of that meeting and of the Presi- 
dent's speech. I have since learned from somewhat of an authoritative 
source that Mr. Hitler has learned of us and has said that the Mormon 
people are doing the German government no harm and he wants them 
let alone. 

I believe perhaps that may be true, for I can testify that during 
the past six months particularly we have had a friendliness shown us 
in that nation that has been splendid, and a matter of considerable com- 
fort to us as well. 

Not only in Germany are the people tremendously receptive to 
the influences of the Gospel of the Master, but I believe with all my 
heart that the blood of Israel flows in the veins of the peoples of the 
northern European countries. Our missionaries whose business it has 
been to go into Poland and Lithuania have found responses there that 
have convinced me that before long the Lord will see to it that those 
fields are opened up for the promulgation of the Gospel. Likewise 



60 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



in the great country of Russia. I believe that Europe is a rich field for 
the harvest of the work of the missionaries in the near future. 

My heart did rejoice yesterday when the President said that he will 
see to it that in the future the Authorities of the Church go to Europe 
more often. I have been praying for that sort of thing, for the inspira- 
tion of our leaders in the hearts of those people is tremendous. 

There is a professor in the Halle University in the school of religion 
who invites the Elders to come to his study once a year. In 1934 the 
local Elders and missionaries were asked to his study or department 
in the school, and there he kept them until four o'clock in the morning, 
finding out what he could from their side of Mormonism. About six 
months ago two young men from this city were called into his study in the 
evening and kept until three o'clock in the morning. He had them 
deliver a lecture with illustrating films before a class of his advanced 
students. This man said : "There has been but one great religious leader 
arise in the world since the time of Christ, and that man was Joseph 
Smith." 

When our learned men can come to appreciate that there is not only 
a simple plan in the Gospel for people to follow, but a plan that will last 
through the eternities, these thinking men will adopt this plan that will 
give them eternal comfort as it gives us who have adopted it eternal 
comfort. 

My testimony is that Jesus is the Christ, that the prophets who 
surround us this day — fifteen of them- — are spokesmen for almighty 
God, and are engaged in the service of our Heavenly Father, and we 
who give our time and our tithes to assist them in carrying this message 
not only will make people happy in the world today, but give them 
eternal satisfaction. 

May the Lord help us to realize this and study it, and not be content 
with our membership alone, is my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

The Choir and congregation sang the hymn, "O Ye Mountains 
High." 

ELDER T. EDGAR LYON 

Formerly President of the Netherlands Mission 

Words fail to express the joy I experience, my brethren and sisters, 
in being allowed to occupy this position this morning, and especially in 
being allowed to attend the sessions of this Conference. 

This is the first time in seven years it has been my opportunity to 
be present in the sessions of the General Conference, and I am thrilled 
beyond any power I possess to express my gratitude to the Lord for this 
privilege. 

For nearly four years it was my lot to preside over the mission 
in the Netherlands. During those years, I am convinced that the Church 
has gained a stronger foothold in that country than at any other time 
in the past. 



ELDER T. EDGAR LYON 



61 



While the number of converts in recent years is not quite so great 
as the number made in the years immediately following the World War, 
nevertheless, for the past three years we have had increases in our 
converts as compared with the years before that, and the Saints are 
manifesting a finer spiritual attitude as proved by the fact that they are 
paying their tithes and their Fast offerings, and attending their meetings 
better than they have done heretofore. 

We rejoice in the fact that the members in this foreign land have 
been realizing the responsibility resting upon them, and throughout the 
period of our administration — as was the case during that of our prede- 
cessor — we have been endeavoring to train the local people to assume 
and bear all responsibility in conducting their affairs in the branches 
and districts. I am thoroughly converted to this policy inaugurated by 
President Widtsoe when he presided over the European missions. While 
there have been many difficulties connected with the transition from 
missionary leadership to that of local leadership, nevertheless, churches 
and branches in the mission field are securing a certain stability which 
they never had before, and there is a sense of permanence creeping into 
the organizations that was never the case with the constant change of 
missionary leadership. 

It was our opportunity while laboring in the field to celebrate the 
seventy-fifth anniversary of the founding of the Netherlands Mission, 
and at that period of time it appeared that the Lord had commenced to 
pour out his Spirit in richer abundance upon the people of that land 
than ever before. We had a most successful year during our Jubilee 
and one of the things that was gratifying to us was the fact that the 
newspapers commenced to come to us for news and published all that 
we would give. At conference sessions and commemorative meetings 
they had reporters in attendance who wrote accounts better than we 
could have done — favorable accounts — which were given wide circula- 
tion throughout the land. I rejoice in this change of attitude that has 
come in the press of the Netherlands with regard to our Church. 

Another objective that I think will perhaps be realized within the 
near future will be the recognition of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints by royal decree in the Netherlands, as an official church 
on equal footing with all other ecclesiastical organizations of that land. 

We have been endeavoring to develop the auxiliary associations 
in that land, and, under local leadership and local boards, that compare 
very favorably with our own stake boards here at home, we have seen 
our Mutuals, our Relief Societies, our Sunday Schools, Primary and 
Genealogical Associations grow and advance. We have found that the 
Primary and the Sunday Schools are perhaps two of the best means 
we have had in the field for giving our Elders contacts with strangers, 
and later bringing people to a knowledge of the Gospel. We get the 
children of the non-members in the Primary, and then the Elders visit 
their parents and succeed in getting the children in the Sunday Schools. 
We try to take the children by the hand and the parents by the heart and 
bring them to the Gospel. 



62 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



To give you an illustration: At one period during a year and a 
half the only converts we made in the large city of Rotterdam were 
people who became acquainted with the Church through the fact that 
their children had been brought into the Primary first. So we rejoice 
in this work. Also the work of our Genealogical Association has been 
organized and placed on a permanent basis under local leadership, and 
I think that the papers on file in the Temple and in the Genealogical 
office will indicate that perhaps we have achieved an organization that is 
better than any other genealogical organization in the missions in Europe. 
The people are industriously engaged in doing their genealogical research 
at the present time. They have a system of exchange not only with our 
own mission, but with the local groups working here in Salt Lake, as 
well as groups in other missions where there are many' Hollanders who 
have emigrated. 

We rejoice also in the fine contacts .we have had with the Elders 
laboring in the missions. They are fine young men. We are pleased to 
report at the present time that so far as we know all of them are enjoying 
excellent health. We have had some serious illness among our Elders — 
two cases that were so serious that we despaired of their lives — but 
through the goodness of the Lord in ways that I think are nothing short 
of modern miracles, these men have been restored to normal health and 
strength and have been allowed to complete their labors. 

I rejoice in the testimony of the Gospel that I have. I rejoice that 
the Lord has been so good to allow me to have this opportunity, and I 
hope and pray I may go forth to raise my voice to preach the truths of 
the everlasting Gospel restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith. I 
know that he is a prophet of the Lord, and that in the passing of the 
years he will be recognized by the leaders of all mankind, both within 
and without the Church, as the greatest prophet of the latter-days, a 
real leader, who will take his place with the passing of the years alongside 
of the prophets of old. 

That we might go forth striving to serve the Lord and walk in his 
paths, is my prayer, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

My dear brethren and sisters : This has been a very profitable and 
pleasant Conference. We have all enjoyed it greatly. It has been a 
witness to me that the Spirit of God is still available to his servants here 
upon earth ; not only that, but as I have looked at this congregation I 
have felt impressed that the simple truths of the Gospel, plain, easily 
understood, still sound good to latter-day ears. 

REJOICES IN REMARKS OF PRESIDENT GRANT 

I was stirred by the remarks of our President yesterday. My soul 
responded to all that he said. As one who was born in Europe I need not 
tell you that my heart leaped in response to his statement that the Church 



ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 



63 



would give continuing and increasing attention to the people in the lands 
from which we all have come, either directly or by descent. The blood 
of Ephraim, the blood of Israel, runs strong in European countries, and 
I believe that the time has come, as predicted by the prophets of old, in 
the Book of Mormon, that in the latter days groups of the faithful shall 
be found throughout the earth, serving as centers of inspiration to those 
with whom they come in contact. 

So I rejoice in all that our President said, and I would be greatly 
tempted to comment on his remarks were it not for the fact that for some 
time I have had in mind a subject that I would like to present to the 
Latter-day Saints. In fact I have gone so far as to make some notes 
dealing with this subject, which I shall follow if I can. 

THE LORD GIVES SPIRITUAL LAWS ONLY 

The subject, I think, will appeal at first sight as not one of deep 
spiritual import, yet I feel free to use it, for in the philosophy of Mor- 
monism all things pertaining to man's life have a spiritual meaning. This 
was plainly stated by the Lord to the Prophet Joseph Smith : 

Verily I say unto you that all things unto me are spiritual, and not at 
any time have I given a law which was temporal, .... for my command- 
ments are spiritual, they are not natural nor temporal. 

* 

From the beginning of its history, the restored Church of Christ 
has been concerned actively with the temporal welfare of its members. 
It has fostered city-building, business and farming as well as education 
and the erection of meeting houses, tabernacles and temples. Our pres- 
ent attempt in behalf of economic security is but an evidence of this ideal 
of the Church. 

In this day of world-wide unrest, it has become evident that a major 
cause of depressions and contentions has been and is the declining em- 
phasis placed upon the productive activities of mankind — the activities 
which lie as foundations of a contented, progressive civilization. 

HAPPINESS IN HUMBLE PURSUITS 

Agriculture and the crafts are being spoken of as the "humbler" 
tasks of life, and by this false valuation enterprising youth looks to so- 
called "higher" pursuits, too often to his own lesser happiness and always 
to the diminished welfare of humanity. 

There was a time, not many generations ago, when craftsmanship, 
the power to shape articles useful to man from wood and fibre, stone 
and metal, from the raw materials of earth, was held to possess a noble 
dignity, second to none. Today, through a distorted vision of life, youth 
hesitates to train mind and muscle, nerve and sinew, for the necessary 
trades of the world. There is a scarcity of really skilled workers in the 
trades. Yet, the competent artisan has an income not much inferior, 
if any, to that of the average so-called "professional" man. Those among 
our people who have the natural mechanical endowment should not hesi- 
tate to enter the trades as a means of livelihood.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



AGRICULTURE A BASIC INDUSTRY 

The tilling of the soil has ever been recognized as the basis of na- 
tional welfare. It is the basic industry of humanity. Without it mankind 
could not survive. The physical toil which formerly accompanied farming 
could, if farming were managed properly, disappear with the invention 
and introduction of farm machinery. Work is not undesirable; it ac- 
companies all success. The drudgery charged against farm life may in 
our day be eliminated by proper planning and systematic approach to 
farm tasks. Advancing science has accumulated a body of knowledge 
concerning the production of plants and animals, which has raised agri- 
culture, from the point of view of organized knowledge, to one of the 
best established of professions. Our institutions of learning, notably the 
agricultural colleges, give unsurpassed training for life on the farm. A 
person should train for agriculture as for any other profession. 

It was J. W. Sanborn, first president of the Utah State Agricultural 
College, who went back to his native New Hampshire, and converted, by 
modern methods, worn out, deserted farms into prosperous, money mak- 
ing enterprises. And he assured me that he won unsurpassed joy in 
the labor. 

My spirit thrilled to the young missionary who said to me, "My 
brother and I are poultry producers. The flocks of poultry are keeping 
me on this mission. When I am released, I shall go back to that business. 
It is good enough for me." It is a source of satisfaction to me to know 
that perhaps two-thirds of the Latter-day Saints are farmers, tillers of 
the soil, keepers of flocks, producers of the world's first necessity, food. 
We may get along without many things but food we must have. 

FOOD THE FIRST NECESSITY 

Hunger is a prime factor in the social and economic ills of mankind. 
One needs only spend an hour in the congested, poverty-ridden sections 
of the world's great cities to understand that the cause of human convul- 
sions, often resulting in bloodshed, is the lack of bread. Disease of body 
and mind as of spirit travels in the wake of hunger. A nation in which 
all citizens are well-fed is a nation of prosperous peace, of courage to 
undertake the conquest of natural forces for the good of man. Fear 
departs from the man whose food for himself and his family is assured. 
He faces the world and its problems fearlessly, courageously, trustingly. 
He may use his powers to the full. 

The farmer, though he use but a modicum of farm wisdom, may be 
freed from hunger. Let that be remembered by all whose tastes lead 
toward the land, but who, because of the erroneous ideals of the age, are 
tempted to look elsewhere for a life pursuit. Indeed, it would be well 
if those following other pursuits would maintain a kitchen garden. The 
professional or business man would find release from many troubles, if 
he devoted a few hours a week to the cultivation of a garden. And the 
income in food produced is not to be ignored. During the summer of 



ELDER JOHN A. WIDTSOE 



65 



1918 the war gardens of Salt Lake City, covering only a part of the 
vacant lots and backyards of the city, produced crops valued at more 
than one-half million dollars. May we never forget the ideal of our 
pioneer fathers : the home with its home garden. May the majority of 
Latter-day Saints continue to be tillers of the soil and keepers of flocks 
and herds. 

The woman often determines the career of a man. Again it must 
be said that farm life may be made to yield happiness for the man and 
the woman, and confer a real boon upon the children who may be born 
to them. But the woman, as the man, should receive some preparation 
for life on the farm. In the modern Palestine, schools are maintained 
for the training of farmers' wives, and with most excellent results. 

AGRICULTURE AND SCIENCE 

The farmer and the farmer's wife may receive today the same train- 
ing of mind and emotions given to those of other pursuits. The spirit 
of culture, of trained intellects and awakened emotions, may be enjoyed 
perhaps most fully under the natural conditions surrounding farm life. 

In our imperfect social-economic structure, it is true that the farmer . 
has not always had a fair deal. But, a new day for the farmer is dawning. 
Thinking men recognize as never before the importance of maintaining 
a sound, prosperous pastoral foundation of the world's commonwealths. 
And science, the wonder-worker, is finding outlets for the farmer's 
products not dreamed of before. Eminent farmers, industrialists and 
scientists, the foremost in the nation, have combined to help find new 
markets for the farmers' products. Formerly, the farmer was only a 
food producer. Today with the aid of modern science, the products of 
the farm may be used to build houses, to furnish them, to paint them, 
to drive automobiles, to make artificial silk and plastics to compete with 
stone and metal, and hundreds of other things useful to man. A new 
applied science known as Farm Chemurgy is being established — which 
means the use of chemistry in the service of agriculture, by which the 
farm, the factory and the scientific laboratory join in benefiting them- 
selves and the world. 

LIFE ON THE FARM CAN BE MADE RICH 

Even under present conditions who shall say that the farmer and the 
farmer's family cannot live life richly. Thereby hangs the whole matter. 
Our life pursuit must be only in part a business ; it must be more a mode 
of living, else we cannot win happiness. Life is bigger than the parts 
of which it is made. From that point of view, agriculture leads the many 
pursuits of man. It is a mode of life under the open sky, in contest and 
collaboration with the genial forces of nature, near in feeling to God, 
who made the earth. It produces ; it does not destroy. It gives ; it does 
not take. It adds true wealth to the world's storehouse ; it enlarges the 
soul of the farmer.

ing grain. Strong men are called from the farm, from the earth as the 
Lord gave it, from honest creative toil, to correct the world's mistakes. 

My plea this day is that the Latter-day Saints give increased atten- 
tion to the production of food and the winning of physical and spiritual 
health from the cultivation of the soil. 

May God help us always to have our feet firmly upon the soil, to be 
owners and tillers of the land, and to follow the great example which 
we have had set for us in the past, showing us that strength, vitality and 
power and a rich form of living come to those who deal with the earth 
as the Lord gave it to man. 

May God bless us in all respects. I have enjoyed immensely this 
conference, and I feel that the Lord is with us and blessing us. If time 
permitted I would like to add my testimony, by actual recount of experi- 
ences, the manner in which the world now looks to us as never before 
for leadership ; and how we are explaining, making clear to the nations, 
the mysteries which must be solved if mankind is to move forward into 
a day of happiness and perfect joy. I pray that we may all be blessed 
according to our needs, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I feel profoundly impressed to endorse the remarks by Brother 
Widtsoe. I have often remarked that but for the splendid characters 
that come from the farms to the cities, the cities would die of their own 
immoral weight. The larger the city, as a rule, the greater the amount 
of crime. The more a man loves the farm and lives on it, the healthier 
in spirit and body he is. I longed as a young man to live on a farm, but 
I have never cultivated' an acre of land, so of course I cannot talk 
from experience ; but I can say that the majority of our missionaries come 
from the farms, notwithstanding the farmers do not produce a majority 
of the money. This shows where the real, genuine faith is. 

I am going to bring something from a great statesman to read to 
you this afternoon. 

ELDER JAMES M. KIRKHAM 

Former President of the East Central States Mission 

I am very grateful to the brethren who gave me the privilege 
of going into the mission field and presiding for a little more than 
three years over the East Central States Mission. I had never had 
such an experience before in all my life. It is invaluable, and I am 
very grateful for that privilege and opportunity. 

The mission is progressing. There is a change of attitude in 
that country. I recall an instance that happened when I first went 
there. Elders were invited to leave a home, with a very definite 
statement not to return. Before I left the mission they were invited 
back to that same place. This one incident is but representative of 
a general improvement in the attitude toward our people. 



ELDER JAMES M. KIRKHAM

The newspapers there are very much more friendly, as they are 
everywhere, and the people in those states are looking to us. I want 
to emphasize with all the power that I have that we must not fail 
in the great project of the Security Program in this Church, any 
more than we should fail in any other of the things we are called 
upon to do. 

I know that that mission will continue to progress, because I 
have learned from friends since my return home of the splendid 
leadership being exhibited by President William Tew who suc- 
ceeded me in that mission. 

Since coming home I have been laboring in an activity in which 
I was very much interested before I went on my mission — that of 
genealogical work. Recently I have visited a number of stakes in 
connection with convention work. I would like to emphasize to 
you here today that while I am interested in the living, having a 
large family of grown children and being selfishly interested in them, 
I am also interested in the dead. I would like to emphasize to you 
the privilege that is yours to go into the Temples of the Lord and 
there become saviors upon Mount Zion. 

In my youth I was given a blessing and told that I should be- 
come a savior upon Mount Zion, and I wondered how that promise 
could ever be fulfilled. Today I know how it is being realized and 
fulfilled. I want to say to you that we should seek our own dead, 
that we with them might be made perfect. We must not seek only 
those having the same surname as our own but we must seek our 
own kindred dead. I realize when I make this statement that many 
of you are having difficulty in doing this, but the words of Nephi 
remind me that the Lord will require at our hands no service save 
he will provide a way to perform it. 

Oh, he will test us, he will try us, but the Lord will open the 
way. He tells us that if it is necessary, the time shall come when 
we will go to the Temples of the Lord and there will have the names 
given to us. I hope that the prayer that was offered by Brother 
Joseph Fielding Smith last night can be realized, when he prayed 
to the Lord asking him to touch the hearts of the presidents of 
stakes and bishops of wards, that they would assume their leader- 
ship and discharge their responsibility in this great work. 

The time is short and we have much to do. We must seek our 
dead. My experience from careful study and observation, has taught 
me that the Lord is touching the hearts of the people of the world, 
and they are doing a most wonderful work in preparing genealogi- 
cal records. 

To illustrate in one particular, it may be interesting to you to 
know that in the one hundred and ten counties in Tennessee last 
winter from three to five W. P. A. workers in each county were 
copying vital statistics, deeds, and marriage records, and they are 
now available to the public in the city of Nashville. Is the Lord at 
work? The Lord is way ahead of us, brethren and sisters, in paving 



68 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



the way for us, and it seems to me our duty is to take advantage of 
the manner in which the Lord is opening up new and easy fields 
for research. The people of the world are actually gathering rec- 
ords for us. 

May the Lord bless and help us to realize our responsibility, 
our opportunity, our leadership, and then the world will be led to 
glorify our Heavenly Father because of what we are doing and the 
way we are doing it. 

May the Lord help us and bless us to this end, I pray in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

The religious census of 1926 reveals the fact that there are in the 
United States two hundred and thirteen denominations of Christians, 
"presenting a more complicated religious pattern than exists among any 
other people." The total membership of these denominations is nearly 
55,000,000 souls. What a power all these denominations and their fol- 
lowing might have to bring peace to this troubled world ! 

I wish to speak on a subject in which we are all vitally interested, 
the Re-idealizing of the World. I was impressed with the words of 
Elder Widtsoe, for they become so fundamental in their teaching. An 
old oriental said once: "He who sows corn sows righteousness." And 
the farmer does sow righteousness. 

In one of our books of holy scriptures, namely the Pearl of Great 
Price, is a majestic message contained in the words of the Lord to Moses : 

For behold, this is my work and my glory — to bring to pass the 
immortality and the eternal life of man. 

A spiritual message from on high, it involves the recognition of 
Jesus as the living Lord, and religion as an actual experience, and a 
living union with God. It sums up the purposes of God in his relation- 
ship to his children, and is a vision and a light directing to a spiritual 
ideal. The world is in need of turning again to the Savior of the world, 
for he taught that in order to find life, we must turn in service to the 
kingdom. 

It is hard for the modern world to grasp this divine truth today, 
for our civilization is in the throes of all kinds of commotion. It creaks 
and groans in labor disputes ; the home and the sacredness of family 
life are being destroyed ; and again are the nations crashing in world 
war. The Church of the living God does not stand for these things. 
It is man that causes them. We are pleading for the preservation 
of our civilization. If the world could only be taught to turn to the 
Savior, civilization would take care of itself. If civilization is over- 
thrown, it will be because we have thought too much of the rights of 
property and wealth. It will be because civilization has turned from 
God and has built its life on another than the Lord's commanded basis. 



ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 



69 



If Christianity is to have a message today for this war-torn world, 
it must first learn that the Lord is ever revealing his message of love 
with ever increasing clearness, just as he did two thousand years ago. 
For his message is eternal, and when the prophet of old first declared 
that you and I must do justly, love mercy, and walk humbly with our 
God, he spoke the foundation that becomes the fundamental divine duty 
of man. And Jesus declared that we should love the Lord with all our 
hearts, minds and strength, and this involves loving our neighbors as 
ourselves. Are we losing our spiritual values? The values that have 
been made manifest to mankind by the revelations from on high. No 
greater religious teachings have ever risen to equal those of Jesus in 
power and in grace. In days of yore, in the ages before the coming 
of the Son of man, the name of God was always referred to as the power 
that transcends the grasp of our finite minds. Men strove for a vision 
that they might understand reality. It was to obtain an illumination, an 
insight to the divine purposes. 

What we need today is more religion, but let it be real religion, 
with God as the supreme ideal, who is approached in deep humility. 
Let us not seek him for the purpose of preserving civilization, but because 
we have lost our way. He is our lost treasure. We have too long put 
our faith and confidence in the institutions of men, and have lost the 
divine faith which was given us in the beginning of history, and which 
we have given up for the ways of human kind. 

Our homes must become again centers of the way of divine life. 
Children should pray ; parents should pray. Children should be brought 
not so much by word as by divine thought to the altar of God every 
day, and there find more illuminating purposes. Our churches should 
be what all sacred houses should be — houses of prayer — where men and 
women should gather and in deep humility and with hungry hearts 
lift themselves up to him whom, to truly know, is the only life that 
matters. David of old said that the holy temple is not for man, but for 
the Lord God. That God is all for whom we are seeking ; to know him 
and to find him forever is not superstition. It is religion. 

I wish that we might teach the youth of the world to hold fast 
to the teachings of the fathers; and to provoke the consciousness of 
things spiritual. I wish we might read the scriptures more and more in 
all our walks of life, that the youth might be brought into contact with 
truths significant and profound; that they might be affected with the 
thought of revelation. There -is a subtle beauty to all truth, and it 
requires no learning to feel its force. But it admits of much learning 
for its aesthetic quality is so high. Why are certain great truths so 
appealing to every soul today, if they are read and visionized ? Take for 
example the divine words : 

In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth. 

And the earth was without form, and void ; and darkness was upon 
the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the 
waters. 

And God said, Let there be light : and there was light. 



70 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Why were these truths so appealing in our childhood days? It 
was because they were exalted; because they appealed to the spirit of 
man. We did not find so much of a story in these words, as a doctrine. 
It is a great truth, a truth everlasting. A man wrote the words t but it 
is man's speaking glorified. 

I am not depreciating any line of human endeavor that has brought 
mankind to its present condition in our onward march of knowledge. 
What would the world be today without its learning ? Without its men of 
genius and vision? No one ever gave a more exalted view of justice in 
human society than did Plato of old ; and the truths of William James of 
Harvard discovered by years of study and calm reflection will always 
be illuminating mile posts, for the uplift of humanity. But the point 
is this : If the Lord in his holy purposes is to bring about the immortality 
and eternal life of man — and this is his sole purpose — then it will be 
clone as mankind turns to him in that sublime and holy faith which was 
the basic teaching of the Master. 

We are marching on to glorious things in a material way ; inventions 
have changed the social and economic life of man, but have they made 
us see more and more the vision of the divine purposes of God ? Speaking 
of the contributions to progress of the engineer, Sir Alfred Ewing, 
President of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, 
recently said : 

Beyond question, these gifts are benefits to mankind, making life 
fuller, wider, healthier, richer in comforts and interests and in such happi- 
ness as material things can promote. But we are acutely aware that the 
engineer's gifts have been and may grievously be abused. In some there 
is potential tragedy and present burdens. Man was ethically unprepared 
for so great a bounty. In the growth of morals, he is still unfit for the 
tremendous responsibility it entails. The commands of nature have been 
put into his hands, before he knows how to command himself. 

Humanity must turn if the world will go on. The vision of God 
must be made clearer ; the vision of the kingdom must be the impelling 
thing in life, and a recreated society must come by a re-idealizing of the 
world. Civilization must be better unified by a divine faith in the 
"divine purposes." 

Yes, we have seen this old world beginning to crumble; signs of 
social chaos, class struggle and revolt; the rumblings of coming war. 
But the Christian world is able, if it will, to bring about a new world; 
a new stirring of conscience and idealism in men of good-will, some of 
whom are intellectuals, some of them workers — all dreaming of something 
finer, juster, and nobler, dreaming of a time again, when men will leave 
their lower selves and march hand in hand toward the deeper and richer 
life, when the war-drum sounds no longer and the battle flag is furled 
in the parliament of man, the federation of the world. The forces 
which are to make the world, the world it ought to be, are now within it, 
and every sign of the presence of God in the world is of help to us. 
The Gospel of our Lord and Savior has been restored and the past 
and the future meet within it as it bears witness to the truth that God 
is carrying forward his ministry which entered the world when Christ 



ELDER JOSEPH F. MERRILL

was born in Bethlehem. So I bear testimony to you, my brethren, 
holding the Priesthood of God: "They that be wise shall shine as the 
brightness of the firmament ; and they that turn many to righteousness 
as the stars for ever and ever." 

In conclusion let us think of the words of the prophet Moses and 
then of the admonition of Jesus our Lord : 

Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them : 
for the Lord thy God, he it is that doth go with thee ; he will not fail thee, 
nor forsake thee. 

* * * 

These things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with you. 

But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will 
send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to 
your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you. 

Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you : not as the world 
giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be 
afraid. 

May the Kingdom of God triumph in all the world, I pray in his 
name. Amen. 

An anthem, "O Holy Father," was sung by the Choir. 
Elder Leland E. Anderson, President of the South Sanpete Stake, 
offered the closing prayer. 

Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock. 

SECOND DAY 
AFTERNOON MEETING 

Saturday, October 2, 1937. 

The fourth session of the Conference was held at 2 o'clock p. m., 
Saturday, October 2. 

The Nebo Stake Choir, under the direction of Elder Carl Nelson, 
furnished musical numbers for this meeting. The opening selection was 
"Recessional." 

Elder Herman Bunderson, President of the Box Elder Stake, 
offered the opening prayer.

ELDER JOSEPH F. MERRILL 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

A few months ago I was discussing a Priesthood project with Bishop 
William R. McConkie. I asked him for suggestions as to how it might 
be put over. His answer, I thought, was very wise : "Brother Merrill, 
that project will easily go over if there is sufficient faith developed in 
the members of the Priesthood." 



72 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



NEED OF GREATER FAITH 

I have thought of that many times since, and have concluded that 
if there is one thing more than another that perhaps we need in the 
Church today, it is greater faith. I was very heartily in sympathy with 
what Elder Stephen L Richards had to say yesterday about that subject. 
We are all greatly concerned with the faith of our youth. We are all 
greatly concerned with guiding and protecting them from those influ- 
ences that will destroy their faith. 

We are concerned, not only with the faith of the youth, but we are 
concerned with the faith of all our people, particularly those that bear 
the holy Priesthood, because the records show that there is a very great 
apparent lack of faith, as judged by works, and it is works, we know, 
that is the standard in the Church by which we shall be judged. 

So the question arises : How can we develop faith ? May I say, 
my brethren and sisters, that there is one means, I think, that is all too 
generally neglected in the Church, and that is prayer in the home. I 
speak from my own experience, largely, and observation, when I make 
that remark, because if experience has taught me one thing more than 
another it is that God does hear and answer the prayer that is made to 
him in faith, if the prayer is accompanied also with the desire to fulfill 
all the conditions of faith 

Faith, like many other things, is a gift of God, we are told, so some 
people say: 'Why worry? If we haven't faith, God has just denied it, 
and we are not to blame." Do we not know that everything that we have 
comes from God — our homes, our families, any talents that we may 
have, health, and everything else that we enjoy? If we violate the laws 
of health can we expect to have health? If we violate spiritual laws can 
we expect to enjoy a high degree of spirituality? 

Faith is one of those spiritual gifts that I believe is based upon law. 
We learn, from the teachings of the Prophet Joseph, that if we get any 
blessing from heaven, it is because we fulfill the conditions upon which 
that blessing is based, and that is a truth that not only comes from the 
mouth of our Prophet, it is also a truth that has been established by 
scientific research. Every investigator in the field of material science 
knows that when he fulfills the conditions he can predict the results, and 
if the conditions vary, then the results will vary, and when the conditions 
are completely fulfilled the result will be realized completely. So faith 
is one of those gifts that we may acquire, that we may cultivate, only if 
we fulfill the conditions upon which faith is based. 

FAITH BASED UPON INTELLIGENCE 

Now, I believe, my brethren and sisters, that we can appeal not 
only to our emotions and to that obedience to conditions that we might 
say springs from emotion, but we can also appeal to the intellect. The 
God whom we worship is characterized by intelligence. That is his 
glory. We are his children, literally his spirit children, and in the 
great law of the universe, in the biological field, at any rate, we have 



ELDER JOSEPH F. MERRILL 



73 



found — this has been revealed to us by scientific research — that like 
begets like. As children of our Father in Heaven we possess, in embryo, 
at least, his attributes. We possess intelligence, which has been given 
to us to be developed and to grow. 

We have in the Church a saying that we very frequently repeat : "As 
God now is, man may become," a beautiful statement of the great law 
of eternal progression. I believe that in this matter of faith we can 
•ippeal to the intelligence as well as to the emotions, and I believe that 
if we are going to have our faith firmly established on an enduring rock, 
it must be based upon the agreement of our intelligence with our 
emotions. 

EVIDENCES OF JOSEPH SMITH'S INSPIRATION 

That brings us to the question, is this God's work, or is it not ? Was 
it set up by God-inspired men, or was it set up by Joseph Smith, who 
was self -deceived and might have been a fanatic ? Well, of course, that 
is a very hard saying, but anyhow, it is either one thing or the other. It 
is either God-inspired or else Joseph Smith was a fanatic. I can not see 
how we can logically escape the conclusion. 

So the question is : Is it God-inspired ? That brings us, my breth- 
ren and sisters, to the Prophet himself, and therein, I believe, if we make 
a careful study of the Prophet, of his life, of his works, of his achieve- 
ments and character, we shall find that we cannot explain him except on 
the true basis that he was God-inspired. The Prophet, as we know, was 
not trained for his work, as the world considers training necessary. He 
was ignorant of the teachings of the scholastic world. He did not have 
the advantage of trained teachers, of laboratories, of museums, of art 
galleries, and all of the other influences and facilities that in this modern 
day are considered necessary to qualify a man for an important job. 

But what did he do ? That is the question. Well, I think in looking 
at the Prophet we might look at internal evidences and external evi- 
dences. When we look to internal evidences we are looking to those that 
operated with Peter. You remember when Christ asked : 

Whom do men say that I, the Son of man, am ? 

And they said, some say that thou art John the Baptist ; some, Elias ; 
and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets. 

He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am ? 

You remember the answer : 

And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son 
of the living God. 

And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon 
Barjona; for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my 
Father which is in heaven. 

In other words, the surest, the best method we have of convincing 
ourselves that Joseph Smith was genuine is the spirit of inspiration and 
revelation. Every believing soul who will humble himself and ask in 
faith, and try to fulfill the conditions necessary to get an answer, can 



74 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



receive it and will receive it. It is by divine inspiration that President 
Grant yesterday morning was able to declare that he knew that this is 
the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and that Joseph Smith was a prophet. That 
was the same method by which Brother George F. Richards was also 
able to testify. All the brethren who have borne their testimony in this 
Conference received that knowledge in that way — a sure, safe way. 

But to many, trained by the methods by which the public schools 
are now training our young people, that may not appear to be the right 
way. They want a materialistic way. Well we can appeal to external 
evidences that can be brought to bear in this case. What are they? We 
may look at the teachings, at the achievements, and at the character and 
the personality of the Prophet Joseph Smith, and then we find, with 
respect to his teachings, that he knew more about the spirit and the truth 
of the Holy Bible than all the trained theologians in the world. We re- 
member that in his day frightful doctrines were taught — infant damna- 
tion ; a literal lake of fire and brimstone, into which those who knew no 
law were pitched and would remain eternally, because they had not died 
with a profession of faith upon their lips. It did not make much differ- 
ence what their conduct was, if they had not confessed the name of Jesus 
Christ. Frightful doctrines! Horrible! 

Well, what did the Prophet teach about those things? What did 
the Prophet teach about many other things? There is one thing that 
he taught that I think reveals the justice, the mercy and love of God to 
a greater degree than anything else that I have known about — the doc- 
trine of salvation for the dead. 

How many of the college trained, university trained theologians of 
the world could tell you what Paul meant when he said : 

Else why are ye baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all, 
why are ye then baptized for the dead? 

And when Peter said : 

For this cause was the Gospel also preached to them that are dead, 
that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, and yet live 
according to God in the spirit. 

Who understood what was meant when Peter said that during the 
time of separation of the body from the spirit the Savior went and preach- 
ed to those that were sometime disobedient in the days of Noah ? Who 
among all these scholars could tell what Malachi meant when he wrote 
of turning the hearts of the children to the fathers, and the fathers to 
the children ? Those doctrines that make a reality of what Brother Levi 
Edgar Young quoted this morning from the Pearl of Great Price : 

For behold, this is my work and my glory — to bring to pass the 
immortality and eternal life of man! 

Do we want to say that God is going to fail, or will he accomplish 
his purpose? How could he accomplish his purpose, except for this 
beautiful doctrine, of which the Christian world knew nothing? They 
knew nothing then ; they know nothing now. But in teaching that doc- 



ELDER JOSEPH F. MERRILL 



75 



trine, that the work of redemption will go on in the world of spirits, in 
cooperation with the work here, and thus that the gates of heaven will 
be opened to all who fulfill the conditions, either in this life or in the 
life beyond, what does it reveal? It reveals that God does love us, that 
he has provided a way, that his purposes will be accomplished, and that 
the great majority of his children will be saved, with some degree 
of glory. 

Who knew about those things ? Well, that teaching of the Prophet 
Joseph Smith alone stamps him, in my judgment, as the greatest religious 
teacher that has lived in mortality since the days of the Savior. 

SOME ACHIEVEMENTS OF JOSEPH SMITH 

But it is not for his teachings alone that we can regard him as being 
a remarkable, outstanding man. We look to his achievements. We find 
that in the short period of fifteen years, from the time that he began to 
translate the Book of Mormon until he met his death at the hands of 
foul assassins, he did a work that cannot be explained except on the 
ground that he was divinely led, taught and inspired, or else that he was 
a super-man, greater than any mortal that has ever lived upon the earth. 

What did he do? Led his poverty-stricken people, who were per- 
secuted and driven during all of that time, laid out cities on new and 
beautiful lines, built two temples, set up a well-nigh perfect church 
organization, counseled, administered to and comforted his persecuted 
people, while he himself was almost continually persecuted. His literary 
work alone was in quantity, and certainly in quality, enough to occupy 
the full time of any man of college or university training that we know 
anything about during a full life-time. Six volumes of Church History ; 
translated the Book of Mormon ; wrote a book of revelations containing 
truths that indicated a far more complete knowledge of the plan of sal- 
vation than all the teachers of Christianity since the days of the Savior 
and his apostles had ever exhibited. 

Well, now, my brethren and sisters, when we contemplate these 
things and call them to the attention of our young people with an appeal 
that they go and study the Prophet from his beginning to his end, his 
achievements, his teachings and all that pertains to him, they will find 
something that cannot be explained unless they do accept the truth that 
Joseph Smith was divinely inspired and divinely taught. 

Take the translation of the Book of Mormon alone, translated in 
the short period of about seventy-five days. Well, a criticism was made 
that it was not punctuated and paragraphed. Do we not know that that 
is one of the strong evidences of the divinity of that work? Did you 
ever see, either in a photostatic copy or in the real thing any ancient 
writing that was paragraphed? Were the words and the sentences not 
all run in together? They did not have in those days — at any rate they 
did not exhibit in their writings — the modern mode of composition di- 
viding into sentences, paragraphs, etc., with all of the marks that go 
with proper punctuation. They wrote right along continuously. There-

f ore to charge that that work was the work of an ignoramus because it 
lacked those elements is to say that it was divine, because the translation 
was a literal translation. 

That great volume, written from translated dictation in the incred- 
ibly short time of about seventy-five days without what we find in 
modern manuscripts — erasures, insertions, etc., but just written right 
along continuously — stamps Joseph Smith as some one who was either 
God-taught or supermortal, as judged by all the standards that the world 
has set up by which to measure men. 

So I appeal very earnestly to our young people to study the Prophet, 
measure him, examine him by exactly the same standards that are given 
to them in their schools, colleges, and universities by which to evaluate 
men. And what will you conclude if you do that? I think you will at 
least conclude that he was a most wonderful man. As Josiah Quincy 
once said in his book, "Figures of the Past," pages 376 to 400 : 

JOSIAH QUINCY'S TRIBUTE 

It is by no means improbable that some future text-book, for the use 
of generations yet unborn, will contain a question something like this : 
"What historical American of the 19th Century exerted the most powerful 
influence upon the destinies of his countrymen?" And it is by no means 
impossible that the answer to that interrogatory may be thus written, 
"Joseph Smith, the Mormon Prophet." 

The wonderful influence which this founder of religion exerted, and 
still exerts, throws him into relief before us, not as a rogue to be in- 
criminated, but as a phenomenon to be explained. 

And he ends his chapter with these words : 

I have endeavored to give the details of my visit to the Mormon 
Prophet with absolute accuracy. If the -reader does not know what to 
make of Joseph Smith I cannot help him out of the difficulty. I myself 
stand helpless before the puzzle. 

Josiah Quincy, you know, was a trained man, trained after the 
manner of Harvard University, and trained in the wisdom of the world. 
He occupied an important position as Mayor of the City of Boston ; and 
yet this is his statement. He made his visit to the Prophet Joseph in 
May, 1844, a very few weeks before his martyrdom, in company with 
Charles Francis Adams. He saw the Prophet, who knew not of his 
coming. He saw him exactly as you would find him on any day, and 
yet he was so influenced by the personality of Joseph Smith, and by his 
accomplishments, his achievements, that he could not explain him. 

RESULTS OF FAITH 

He was unexplainable from the standpoint of the world. To say 
that he was a fanatic, that he was ignorant, that he was untrained — all 
of which, of course, might be true, so far as his schooling was concerned, 
so far as his opportunity for culture in his boyhood was concerned — 



ELDER ANTOINE R. IV INS 



77 



but he was born of honest parents, and he was reared in a religious home, 
where love and faith prevailed. They believed their Bible, and so when 
Joseph read : "If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth 
to all men liberally, and upbraideth not . . . but let him ask in faith," 
Joseph believed. With what result ? With the result that he went into the 
woods to pray, in the same spirit and for the same purpose that we ought 
to pray, in humility, desiring the help of heaven. And he got it, so he 
claimed. Well, what was the claim ? The most glorious vision that has 
ever yet been given to mortal man, in which he beheld the very God of 
Heaven, the Father of all, and Jesus Christ, our Redeemer, gloriously 
revealed to him. He heard their voices. He received their instruction. 
Did he or did he not ? Was he mistaken ? Explain, if he was mistaken, 
how he got his wonderful knowledge of the whole field of the Bible, and 
its inspiration, and how he was able to teach the glorious things he 
taught. But he received the visitation of other heavenly messengers. 
Were these things true? 

ADVICE TO YOUNG PEOPLE 

As I say to young people, I say to you, my brethren and sisters, how 
can you explain Joseph Smith? I have only indicated an outline of the 
study that might be made, but I think it is the most important study that 
any young person, or any unconvinced older person might make. And 
if we will make it in honesty, in sincerity, with a desire to know the truth, 
asking God to help us — following the instructions given in Moroni 10 :4 
— we shall certainly not be left in doubt as a result of a careful, thorough 
study; we must come to the conclusion that we have a sure and a solid 
basis for our faith. 

My brethren and sisters, let us get that faith. If we have it how can 
we be slackers in this Church ? How could any holder of the holy Priest- 
hood be a slacker? Why not respond to the teachings that are given to 
us by the Presidency of this Church and the inspired leaders of this 
Church, and those that we may read in the standard works of the Church ? 
Why not respond and act, knowing of a surety that God lives, and that 
this is his work — a knowledge that all of us can acquire if we only will 
put ourselves in a condition to receive that knowledge. 

God help us to do so, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER ANTOINE R. IVINS 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

I am pleased, my brethren and sisters, to stand before you in 
this capacity this afternoon, and bear my testimony, along with the 
brethren who have already addressed you, to the efficacy and the 
truthfulness of this wonderful work in which we are engaged. 

There are many things that might be said here this afternoon, 
many lines of thought that might be followed, and one wonders 
just what he may say that may be of worth and value to the con- 
gregation. It is no mean responsibility to stand here and occupy 



78 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



the time of eight or ten thousand people. You have come for a pur- 
pose, and if we fail to meet that purpose perhaps we shall fall under 
condemnation. 

The other day, some little time ago, I was talking with a banker 
who knew my father, and he wanted to express a word of appre- 
ciation for him, and he said : "He comes the nearest to combining 
religion and business of any man I know." He said: "For me, they 
don't mix. I am a banker." I wonder whether they ought not to. 

The Gospel of Jesus Christ is a gospel of love. When Jesus 
was asked what is the greatest commandment, he said that the 
first and greatest commandment is to love the Lord thy God with all 
thy might, mind and strength. "And the second is like unto it ; thou 
shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." 

Now, we are here to hear about the Gospel, and perhaps to get 
some stimulus from the discussion, and if I could say anything that 
would make a single person go out of this Conference feeling more 
friendly toward his brother and his neighbor than when he came 
here, I would feel amply repaid. 

I believe that the Gospel of Jesus Christ has in it every element 
that is essential and necessary for the conduct of all the affairs of 
human activity. In other words, I believe that there is nothing that 
men do in honor before God, and essential to their development and 
well-being, in which that fundamental principle of love should not 
enter. 

The Gospel of Jesus Christ is the plan that was given in the 
beginning, when the foundation of the world was laid, for the 
maximum and greatest development of mankind. Christ came to 
emphasize that thing, and to emphasize it by laying down his life, 
in love, for the redemption of mankind. And I firmly believe that 
if we would, that principle could characterize every worthy activity 
of life. 

I quite agree with my banker friend that if the purpose of 
banking is to squeeze out of the populace the last ounce of its life- 
blood, so to speak, in interest, that they are inimical. But I believe 
that that is not the purpose of an institution of that kind. It should 
not be. It is here for the service of mankind, and when it fails to 
serve it fails in its purpose ; and when it fails to appreciate man and 
its responsibility to him, it fails in its purpose. I believe that even 
such a cold-blooded institution as that could be and should be gov- 
erned and administered according to the principles of the Gospel 
of Jesus Christ. 

I believe that if men, the rulers of nations, could so eradicate 
from their hearts the greed and avarice that are likely to accumu- 
late in administering business affairs, that even nations could live 
in peace and harmony and trust each other ; that even nations could 
allow a weaker nation to subsist and exist in peace and lend it a 
friendly hand. 

I believe that all of the trouble that the world is going through 



ELDER ANTOINE R. IVINS 



79 



now, and all of the headlines that we read in such hideous black 
type in the newspapers, come about because men fail to appreciate 
that one principle. If we could only bring that to bear upon the 
activities of our lives, we would be happy and we would be pros- 
perous, and would be courageous and fearless in facing the future. 

I think the greatest fear that men have, perhaps, is the fear that 
this avaricious spirit will cause somebody to come in upon them 
in their old age, and deprive them of the means of self-maintenance 
and the respect that goes with it. If every man knew that he could 
live to the end of his days with an opportunity to serve the Lord 
and his fellows, and eat and wear what was essential to his hap- 
piness, this would be a wonderful and an Utopian world. But it 
will never be until we introduce into our daily activities that prin- 
ciple of love. 

Sitting before me is a vast body of the Priesthood of God. Every 
one of you who has accepted that responsibility has allowed a 
servant of God to lay his hands upon your head and commission 
you to function in the orders of the Priesthood, and when you do so 
you either expressly or tacitly agree to serve God to the best of your 
ability. 

Now, if we, all of us who hold the Priesthood, could consciously 
constitute ourselves, as a body, to apply in our daily activities the 
principle of love, we could dominate the society in which we live 
until that spirit would be characteristic of it. 

I am sure that there is efficacy in that principle. I have seen it 
applied in instances. I have seen it in combat with the principle of 
greed and avarice, and I have seen it come off victorious. I have 
seen the man who allowed it to actuate his life, grow from one po- 
sition of responsibility to another, until he commanded the respect 
of all his fellows. I know, because of observations, that it is a virile 
principle in human activity. 

I have had the experience of living in a — pueblo, I was going 
to say — in a population where the members of the Church so dom- 
inated the activities of that people that the spirit of love was para- 
mount, and I have seen that people grow to independence, isolated 
by an imaginary boundary line in a foreign country. I have seen 
them develop along those principles to wonderful accomplishments, 
and I have seen the spirit of peace and love settle down upon that 
community, and watched its growth and development. 

I bear you my testimony that it is a principle of life and activ- 
ity, a principle that can dominate our lives and enter into them, and 
I testify that when it does, peace and joy and harmony come into the 
lives of those who practice it. 

We have been told this afternoon that one of the needs of our 
youth — or yesterday, rather, we were told that one of the crying 
needs of our youth is more faith in the leaders of this Church. I 
want to bear my testimony this afternoon to that fact, and then I 
want to add that the leaders of the Church are worthy of that faith. 



80 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



I have been blessed, perhaps, greater than the average member of 
the Church, in the privilege of associating with the leaders of the 
Church during the time of my life, and I have associated rather 
intimately with the man who now directs the destinies, under the 
inspiration of God, of this body of worshipers we call the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I have known his associates 
in the presiding quorums of the Church. And then I have had al- 
most six years of contact with one of the bodies of the General 
Authorities of this Church, the First Council of the Seventy. I 
have met them all in solemn assembly in the Temple of God, and 
I have yet to hear fall from their lips an expression of an ulterior 
purpose. I have never heard, in their councils, any advice given 
but under the inspiration of God, if I could interpret that spirit. 

I know that they have your welfare at heart, and I believe that 
any man or woman who has no "axe to grind," who will come and 
investigate their lives and their conduct, cannot help but admit it. 
They try to exemplify in their lives the cardinal principles of the 
Gospel of Christ. 

Now, they do not pretend to be perfect, any more than I do. I 
do not pretend to come near perfection. But I do want to tell you 
that they serve you to the best of their ability, and if any man in the 
congregation, or outside of it, under the sound of my voice, which 
goes out over the radio, were asked to step into their shoes, the only 
thing he could do would be to serve according to his light and that 
which God might give him, and they do it in your interest and in 
mine. And God has blessed them, and he has carried this Church 
onward in that spirit of love and unselfishness and sacrifice. 

I doubt whether there is a man in those councils who sought 
the appointment, either personally or through his friends. It comes 
unbidden. It always comes as a shock to the man who receives it, 
and usually it requires the giving up of ideals and ambitions that 
he has had ; to accomplish things in a field of labor to which he is 
attached ; and every man surrenders that in a spirit of humility and 
service, and I think, as a people, we ought to honor and respect them, 
to trust them and to love them. 

If we will clean house and put our hearts in attune with the 
Spirit of God, go daily about our business, under the influence of 
that Spirit, God will bless us with contentment and a peace and a 
freedom from worry that we can get no other way. 

The Spirit of God is in the Church. The spirit of love is in the 
Church. While we may have some sordid experiences at times, they 
but try us, and if we will meet them in that spirit of love God will 
carry us through. While we may sometimes surfer loss and sacri- 
fice, there is a development even in that which should make us love 
our God and our fellows more. 

I pray that God may be with us, that he may give us an appre- 
ciation of the Gospel that we have within our midst, the tool that 
is given to us, if we will, by which we are to carve out from the 



ELDER SAMUEL 0. BENNION 



81 



granite of our existence a niche and a place in which to live. If we 
will try it we will find it effective. 

Benjamin Franklin once said that he learned as a boy, that if he 
ever wanted a man to take an interest in him, the thing he had to 
do was to let that man serve him some way. God stands ready to 
serve us through the instrumentality of this organization that we 
have. We stand as your servants, ready to serve you. We love 
you. If you will serve the Gospel that has been given to us, in that 
spirit, you will learn to love that Gospel just the same way. If you 
will give it your time and your talent, you will love it in proportion 
to the service that you give unto it. 

That is my prayer in your behalf, that you and I and all of us 
may freely give unto this great body and unto our God the service 
that we owe it and him, that in giving we may gain greater power to 
give, and greater love and greater satisfaction. God bless you. Amen. 

ELDER SAMUEL O. BENNION 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

I sincerely trust that I may be led to say this afternoon that 
which will be best for me and best for all who are here. The Spirit 
of the Lord is in this great congregation, gathered together for the 
purpose of paying tribute to our Eternal Father, and to receive from 
him information and knowledge that will help us on the journey 
of life. 

Yesterday morning, during the sermon of President Grant, 
when he called attention to the fact that the Word of Wisdom was 
given by revelation for the well being of the people, I thought of 
how, from the beginning, the Lord has had a personal interest in 
his children and has directed them in both temporal and spiritual 
affairs. His first commandment to our father Adam, when he sent 
him out of the Garden of Eden into the world that was to bring 
forth thorns, thistles and noxious weeds, was concerning his daily 
labor : 

In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto 
the ground, for out of it wast thou taken; for dust thou art and unto 
dust shalt thou return. 

Later he called Upon Adam by his own voice and revealed the 
foundation principles of the Gospel, particularly the saving or- 
dinance of baptism. 

The Lord visited him and said unto him : 

I am God. I made the world and men before they were in the flesh. 

If thou wilt turn unto me, and hearken unto my voice, and believe, and 
repent of all thy transgressions, and be baptized, even in water, in the name 
of mine only Begotten Son, who is full of grace and truth, which is Jesus 
Christ, the only name which shall be given under heaven, whereby salva- 
tion shall come unto the children of men, ye shall receive the gift of the 



82 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Holy Ghost, asking all things in his name, and whatsoever ye shall ask, 
it shall be given unto you. 

* * * 

Wherefore, [said he] teach it unto your children, that all men, every- 
where, must repent, or they can in no wise inherit the kingdom of God, for 
no unclean thing can dwell there, or dwell in his presence ; for, in the lan- 
guage of Adam, Man of Holiness is his name, and the name of his Only 
Begotten is the Son of Man, even Jesus Christ, a righteous Judge, who 
shall come in the meridian of time. 

Therefore I give unto you a commandment, to teach these things freely 
unto your children. 

And we find in the revelations of God that Adam faithfully con- 
formed to the trust that was given unto him, and he taught the word 
of God unto the children of men all the days of his life. And in 
time the Savior came, in the meridian of time, and he performed his 
work. 

Now we are told by John that there was a man of the Pharisees, 
named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. 

The same came to Jesus by night and said unto him : Rabbi, we know 
that thou art a teacher come from God ; for no man can do these miracles 
that thou doest, except God be with him. 

Jesus answered and said unto him : Verily, verily, I say unto thee, 
Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. 

And then he said further : 

Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a man be born of water and of 
the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That which is born 
of the flesh is flesh ; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Marvel 
not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again. 

And in his revelation in this day he said to his Apostles : 

I say unto you again, that every soul who believeth on your words, 
and is baptized by water for the remission of sins, shall receive the Holy 
Ghost. * * * 

I say unto you, they who believe not on your words, and are not bap- 
tized in water in my name, for the remission of their sins, that they may 
receive the Holy Ghost, shall be damned, and shall not come into my Fa- 
ther's kingdom, where my Father and I am. 

In the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints we find a 
newness of life, as it was in the days of the Master. Men and women 
come into a new way of thinking. I have talked to hundreds of 
people who have been baptized into the Church, who had thought, 
before they came into the Church, that they were worshiping God, 
and that they were doing the things that were right. But they had 
no knowledge of God. They had never been taught that the Lord 
knew them before they were born, as he stated to Adam — that he 
made the world, he made men, and he knew them. It had never 
occurred to them that there was a real birth of the Spirit before 
the foundation of the earth was laid. They had never comprehended 
the fact that our Eternal Father is a personal being, and that we 



ELDER SAMUEL 0. BENN10N 



83 



are made in his image, and that we are like him in form. It had 
never occurred to them that there was such a thing as the preaching 
of the Gospel to those that are dead, or that there is an eternity of 
the marriage covenant, in the form and way in which the Lord has 
decreed. There was no light, so far as the word of God was con- 
cerned, that had come into their lives. 

But after an investigation of these principles of the Gospel, after 
they had become acquainted with the plan of God, in part, and had 
received baptism by water, by immersion, for the remission of their 
sins, and had received the laying on of hands for the reception of 
the Holy Ghost, that witness which the Lord promised unto the 
children of men, through Peter and his Apostles, in their day, — 
when they received that inspiration and confirmation they came in- 
to a new world of thinking and worshiping. Men and women have 
testified to me by the hundreds that they could no more go back 
into their old way of living, or their former belief or understanding, 
than they could go back to yesterday. They were born again, born 
v of the water and born of the Spirit, into a newness of life, into a 
great world of activity, into an influence that came direct from God, 
our Father. And they felt it, no matter where they lived. In all the 
nations of the earth are men found who bear this testimony. 

Yesterday we heard the testimony of the President of the 
Church, who has just returned from his foreign mission, reporting 
that men and women are bearing testimony to the divine mission of 
the Prophet and of the work of God, in foreign lands. They them- 
selves are no more a part of the world. They live among the people, 
of course, in the different nations where they are — as we do here. 
They associate with men and women who have not yet been per- 
mitted to see the truth. But because of their knowledge of the 
Gospel of Christ they are separate and apart. It is just another 
world. This is something to live for. It is something to plan for, 
a foundation upon which men and women can build for the great 
future that shall come to every son and daughter of God, no matter 
where he may be or who he is. 

This thing called mortality will come to an end. Men will go 
on, and those who have received the light of the everlasting Gospel 
will be better prepared to progress and grow than those who have 
not. How long it will continue before the children of men shall all 
have an opportunity I know not. There are millions of people in 
this earth who will never hear the Gospel of Jesus Christ in the 
flesh. But through the great plan of redemption that our Father 
in heaven has revealed in the day and generation in which we live 
it will be taught to them hereafter. For men on the earth shall seek 
for their dead and shall attempt to carry out the plans and purposes 
of God, and when those who have died are ready, they shall have 
an opportunity to accept the Gospel. 

The Gospel is a great and a glorious message. It is a powerful 
influence for good. It will shape the destiny of the human family 



84 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



here and hereafter. It will make men better merchants, better 
bankers, and better business men, and it will make church men 
better church men. It is the power of God unto salvation, and 
there is none who can afford to be without it. It is the word of God. 
it is not an eternal plan. It is not alone the doctrine of Jesus Christ, 
or his word alone, for he said : "My doctrine is not mine but his that 
sent me." He planned for it in the foundation of this earth and 
before, when he formed the great family that we call the human 
family, and made it possible for men and women to understand it 
even there and to have it revealed unto them here. 

There will always be contention in the world and among the 
nations of the earth, until we can come to a unity of the faith. Peace, 
I think, shall never come to this world until the Son of Man comes 
again, for nation shall rise against nation, wars shall occur, and 
famine shall be a part of the history of the world. But to those who 
keep the commandments of God, their paths will be made easy, com- 
pared to the ways of those who do not. They shall not forfeit any- 
thing that may be for their good. Trials often are for our good and 
should be endured by all. Trials make men realize more fully the 
responsibilities they owe to one another. 

This Church, the kingdom of God on the earth, is a growing 
church. The Lord is at the helm. He places those whom he wishes 
to preside. He raises them up from the days of their childhood and 
from their primeval childhood. They are not without his notice, for 
he knows them. The Prophet Joseph Smith gives us that informa- 
tion, and he received it from his Father. 

I bear my testimony unto you that I know that God lives, that 
Jesus is the Christ, that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God, and that 
those who succeeded him are prophets of the Living God, and the 
leaders of his Church; that President Grant is the prophet of God 
at this time and the leader of this Church and the mouthpiece of 
God unto the children of men. 

I bear this testimony in humility and in the love of God. Great 
are the powers of truth that the Lord has revealed, and they shape 
the destiny of every man who pays attention to them and who 
believes them. I say it in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

The Choir and congregation sang the hymn, "For the Strength 
of the Hills." 

ELDER ALBERT E. BOWEN 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

I desire to address myself more particularly to the second and sub- 
sequent generations of Mormonism and to consider with them, and with 
myself as one of them, the matter of our heritage. What is it? 

PIONEERS LAID THE FOUNDATION 

Our fathers came here to a land of forbidding desolation. Through 
grueling toil, rigidly imposed self-denial and incredible privation and 



ELDER ALBERT E. BOW EN 



sacrifice they subdued it, converting barren wastes into fruitful, harvest- 
laden fields. Most of them have now passed on, leaving behind the 
visible evidences of their conquest. 

But the houses they built, many of them, have been torn down, or 
hare fallen into decay. The acres they tilled have passed into strange 
hands. Many of us have gone out away from the scenes of their achieve- 
ments to be ourselves founders of communities and reclaimers of waste 
places. While we, and all among us, benefit immeasurably from the 
works they wrought, yet we may not have in a more particular sense, 
and in the very nature of things many of us cannot, have any part of 
the physical possessions they assembled. We have multiplied far beyond 
the possibility of such division or partition. Obviously these things 
cannot be our real heritage for they are not enduring but by possession 
are exhausted and by use are consumed. 

Our fathers themselves had left behind them houses and lands 
when they came here. None of these could they bring. But what mattered 
that ? They did bring with them the faith and the spirit and the power 
and the will and the purpose to subdue other lands, and to build new 
houses, to raise up other communities and to devise other means of 
supplying physical needs. These qualities of heart and soul could not 
be taken from them; they were beyond the grasp of the despoiler. 
They were the veritable treasures of heaven which thieves could not 
break through nor steal, and which, if incorporated into life, could never 
be corrupted by moth nor rust. 

They could have stayed where they were, retaining their houses and 
their lands, and could have escaped oppression and lived in physical 
comfort, by renouncing their convictions concerning the meaning and 
purpose of life. This they scorned to do, choosing rather to believe 
that if they sought first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, 
all these things they could provide. 

On this foundation principle they built. By adherence to it they 
triumphed. They recognized that no enduring society was ever founded 
on the basis of physical comfort, but that, paradoxical as it may seem, 
the supposedly nebulous, intangible spiritual things constitute the only 
solid foundation on which to build. They had the depth of conviction 
which gave them the courage to choose the spiritual and to make it the 
chief stone of the corner upon which to rear their commonwealth. 

A RICH HERITAGE 

The proper evaluation of the spiritual in the life of the individual 
and the society; the courage to abandon physical comfort when the 
choice lay between the abandonment of that and the abandonment of 
the soul's convictions; the faith that if they walked by the inner light 
+hey would end in triumph ; the will and the purpose to conquer a desert, 
to walk fearlessly into the face of danger and to die, if need be, that 
the immortal soul might still be free — this is our heritage from them. 
In it all the heirs may share, howsoever numerous they may become, 
without fear that in possessing it either will deprive the other. Though 



86 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



multiplied descendants may depart these valleys and go to the outermost 
parts of the earth, they still may carry with them this heritage. It is one 
of the eternal indestructible verities of life that shall always endure. 
It embodies the great foundation principles upon which individual 
stability and community honor and national integrity must be built. 

Our fathers derived it out of their religion which taught them 
belief in God, the Ruler of the universe and the Author of their lives ; 
it taught that life has a purpose and man a destiny which stretches out 
beyond the years of this earth life into the realms of eternity; that his 
existence here has for its purpose the development of all mental and 
spiritual powers latent within him, which can be accomplished by learning 
to think, to create, to deal intelligently with the forces of the universe ; 
and above all to understand and help his fellows and learn to behave 
with justice toward them in all the concerns of life; that after death 
he would live again and enter upon a new life throughout the course 
of which he can go on acquiring knowledge, growing in power and 
understanding and intelligence without limit of time ; that the only pos- 
session he can take with him into that new life will be the spiritual and 
mental power which he has gained by his diligence here. As expressed 
in a revelation in which they believed : 

Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will 
rise with us in the resurrection. 

And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life 
through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much 
the advantage in the world to come. 

This is but a rational application of a principle well understood 
as governing in all human affairs. Mastery of natural forces can 
be achieved only by understanding and observing the laws by which 
they are governed. It is fair to conclude that spiritual and mental 
growth can be attained only by obedience to the laws on which 
they are predicated. If through diligence, observance of correct prin- 
ciples, discipline of the mind and of the spirit, a man attains to a fine 
development of personality in this life, surely it is not unreasonable 
to suppose that that will be his imperishable possession and glory in the 
life he enters upon after death. On the contrary, if through lethargy 
or sin his self-realization in this life is dwarfed, he shall be handicapped 
to that extent as he enters upon the new world. 

Actuated by these beliefs it is not strange that our fathers exalted 
spiritual development above material gain, nor that they should endure 
physical hardship and privation, cleaving to the soul's conviction rather 
than retain physical comfort at the expense of their deep-seated faith. 

Cooperation, mutual helpfulness, the uniting of their strength and 
their resources in their struggle for subsistence were elementary prin- 
ciples of conduct, which flowed naturally out of their religion. 

CONVICTION COMES THROUGH ENDEAVOR 

Their philosophy was one of individual salvation, spiritual and 
temporal. Every man had to know the truth for himself . His conviction 



ELDER ALBERT E. BOW EN

of it is an individual affair, obtained through his own endeavor by con- 
formance to the stipulated conditions. Only the individual himself can 
develop his bodily or mental or spiritual powers. No one else may do 
either for him. The necessary consequence of such belief is the develop- 
ment of self-reliance, industry and diligence, thrift and frugality. A 
society composed of individuals actuated by such beliefs and possessed 
of such qualities must itself become the expression of them. It was 
taught that the idler should not eat the bread of the laborer in Zion. But 
the apparent harshness of this creed is softened and tempered by ad- 
monitions to charity and kindness and help for the unfortunate. In the 
revelations by which they were guided one reads : 

And now, I give unto the church in these parts a commandment, that 
certain men among them shall be appointed, and they shall be appointed by 
the voice of the church ; and they shall look to the poor and the needy, and 
administer to their relief that they shall not suffer ; and send them forth 
to the place which I have commanded them. 

Behold, I say unto you, that ye must visit the poor and the needy and 
administer to their relief, that they may be kept until all things may be 
done according to my law which ye have received. 

And remember in all things the poor and the needy, the sick and the 
afflicted, for he that doeth not these things, the same is not my disciple. 

Self-effort is the condition precedent to individual advancement, but 
cooperation and mutual helpfulness are the facilitating means. It is the 
verdict of history as well as of religion "That there is no reasoned 
peace of heart, no balance and no safety in the soul, until a man in losing 
his life has found it, and has schooled and disciplined his interests and 
will beyond greeds, rivalries, fears, instincts and narrow affections," 
which is to say, until the spiritual assumes ascendency. 

SPIRITUALITY WITHIN REACH OF ALL 

The way to realization of man's spiritual self is the same for all. 
Young and old, rich and poor, all have to conform themselves to the 
law which governs it. That law knows no favorites and recognizes 
no exceptions. Money cannot purchase it for it is beyond price. To 
youth it makes no concessions. The aged may radiate its sweetness 
and serenity only if their lives have conduced to its unfolding. It may 
be had on the same terms by the rich and the poor alike. There are 
no other terms. Spirituality may not be defined. It may only be illus- 
trated. It is a quality that exhibits itself in the poise and serenity of 
those who possess it. It reveals itself in those moments of high exalta- 
tion when a man's soul soars high above material things and wings its 
way into the realm of the infinite. It is that in man which gives him 
kingship over himself and makes him aware of his kinship with God. 
It was that in our fathers which gave them the courage to forsake their 
homes and their lands and their places of security to come to this cruel 
wilderness and to meet with fortitude and good cheer the pains and 
sufferings and distresses incident to their coming. 

Spirituality can neither bud nor bloom in a soul cankered by avarice

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



and covetousness. He who would possess it must purge himself of 
these. It comes into fruition when nurtured by acts of mercy and 
love. 

THE RICH AND THE POOR WARNED 

This • religion which our fathers received and have forwarded and 
transmitted to us is a very practical religion. It takes note of the conditions 
upon which alone man's powers may be unfolded and his higher and 
better self realized, and then proceeds to provide the tasks and mark out 
the course necessary to that realization. Since selfishness and greed 
are fatal to spiritual realization, the rich are enjoined to give to the poor. 
Since envy and covetousness are equally fatal the poor are admonished 
to contrition of spirit and respect for other men's possessions. In the 
revelation it is said: 

Wo unto you rich men, that will not give your substance to the 
poor, for your riches will canker your souls ; and this shall be your 
lamentation in the day of visitation, and of judgment, and of indignation: 
the harvest is past, the summer is ended, and my soul is not saved ! 

Wo unto you poor men, whose hearts are not broken, whose spirits 
are not contrite, and whose bellies are not satisfied, and whose hands 
are not sayed from laying hold upon other men's goods, whose eyes are full 
of greediness and who will not labor with your own hands ! 

No man, rich or poor, is justified under this doctrine in grasping 
out in insatiable greed for that which he has not labored to produce, nor 
in despoiling another of his possessions. But those who have are with 
cheerfulness to relieve the needy, who are to receive in gratitude without 
arrogant demanding. 

TITHES AND OFFERINGS 

A practical means of carrying out these admonitions is likewise 
provided. By revelation it was established as a standing law of the Church 
forever that all should pay one-tenth of their interest annually for the 
support of the poor, the establishment of the Church, and the forwarding 
of its work. Special contributions in the form of fast offerings are 
likewise required 

It may, I think, with safety be said that no person who fully obeys 
these two requirements can be wholly selfish or avaricious, nor can 
the carnal in him assume ascendency over the spiritual. Giving and dis- 
bursing to be orderly and effective must pass through established chan- 
nels. This, too, is provided for in the Church our fathers transmitted 
to us. In this day when an extraordinary need has. arisen the organiza- 
tion is all ready, and for a hundred years has been ready, to meet it. 
The Church has undertaken to do so. The indicated sources of revenue 
are all sufficient to the purpose if the members obey the requirements. 
Let us resolve that no one of us will fail.

CONVICTION GAVE COURAGE 

Inspired and impelled by the burning conviction that they had had 
given to them the truths of heaven our fathers had the courage to leave 
houses and lands, homes and firesides, friends and kinsmen and journey 
into the wilderness. They had the industry to wring from the desert 
a sustenance, the frugality to provide in the day of plenty for their needs 
in the day of adversity, the self-reliance to fend for themselves, the 
spiritual vision to work cooperatively for the common good, and the 
benevolence to help the .distressed. The example of these virtues they 
have bequeathed to us. 

God grant that we may be worthy heirs of so great an inheritance 
that, enlarged and expanded and added upon by our own contributions, 
we may pass it on to the generations to succeed us, I pray in the name 
of Jesus, Amen. 

ELDER LeGRAND RICHARDS 

Former President of the Southern States Mission 

It is a very great pleasure to be privileged to meet again with the 
Saints in General Conference. 

I love the Church. I love our leaders. I love the teachings of the 
Church, and I love the missionaries who labor in the mission field. It 
has been a great honor to be privileged to labor so many years with them 
in the Southern States Mission. And I love the Saints because of their 
wonderful sacrifices for this great work. I think it is an honor to be a 
member in this Church. I am very grateful for the opportunity that 
I have had of laboring in the mission field. I think it is one of the 
greatest privileges in the Church. I have often said that if the Prophet 
Joseph had given his life for no other thing than the establishment of 
the great missionary system of this Church, he certainly would not have 
died in vain. 

No one can be associated with the fine young men and women of the 
Church who go into the mission field, and see how marvelously they 
grow in faith, in understanding of life, and in good works, in the brief 
period of a mission, without realizing its worth to the body of the 
Church. As I have often said, when laboring among those young men 
and women, if they are not worthy to cry repentance to the world I know 
not where the Lord could find people worthy of such a task. 

Since having returned home, a few months past, to reside again in 
Zion, or the headquarters of the Church, I feel very grateful for my 
association with the fine Saints here at home. I am grateful for the 
wonderful faith and testimony that I find in the midst of the people 
here. 

But there are some things, as indicated by some of the addresses 
given at this Conference, that are more or less disturbing. While as- 
sociating with some of my friends recently I was asked whether I was 
orthodox or liberal. I did not know before that we had two parties in 
the Church- It caused me to give considerable thought to the question ; 



90 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



and when I listen to our brethren here bear testimony of the truth of the 
divine mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith, and the truth of the Book 
of Mormon, and of the great work of the Savior of the world, I thank 
God that I am orthodox. 

In my business we do a great deal of exchanging, and if I were 
going to make an exchange I would want to know that I was getting 
something as good as I was giving. I have thought of the orthodox 
teachings of this Church, and I have never heard any stories, in print 
or otherwise, to compare with the story told by the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, save the story of the Son of Man. 

After the silence of ages, without any word from heaven, surely 
nothing in all the world could be so refreshing, so soul-satisfying as to 
have some one again come from God and speak to this world, and make 
again alive to us the reality of the existence of God and of the life to 
follow. 

If there were nothing more in the story told by the Prophet Joseph 
Smith than the visitation of Moroni, standing before him, a resurrected 
being, as far as we know, who had once lived upon this earth, to make 
real to us the fact that we shall live again in bodily form, and know 
each other, and possess the knowledge and experiences of mortality, I 
would rather have that knowledge than any philosophies I know of iri 
this world, outside of the orthodox teachings of the Mormon Church. 

Recently I heard this statement made: "Is it not rather absurd to 
think that we have to regard the Word of Wisdom as we have been 
regarding it?" If I were going to give up my faith in the Word of 
Wisdom I would want something in exchange for it that is better. 

I went into the home, recently, of some friends, to inquire as to their 
welfare, and found a broken-hearted woman and a broken home. Why ? 
Because disobedience to the Word of Wisdom had wrecked that home. 
I once read a statement by a man who said he had seven good reasons 
why he was opposed to liquor and to saloons. Three were daughters 
and the other four were sons. He said: "You cannot run a saw-mill 
without logs, nor a saloon without making drunkards of boys and 
drunkards' wives of the girls." 

If we give up the fundamental teachings of the Church, these 
orthodox things that we have been taught, — the principle of prayer and 
faith in God,- — what can- they offer us in exchange ? Think of when our 
loved ones are lying sick and at the point of death, if we had to give up 
the faith we have been taught from our childhood, that we can do as 
James of old said: "Call the elders of the church, and let them pray 
over him anointing him with oil, * * * and the prayer of faith shall 
save the sick." I don't know what men or women can offer us in their 
modern thought in exchange for such fundamental and comforting 
teachings. 

Now, I mustn't take more of your time. There are many mission 
presidents. I hope while I am here at home that the Latter-day Saints 
who know me shall know that I am a fundamentalist ; that I believe 
in the orthodox teachings of this Church. The Savior once said, quoting 
from the prophets of old: 



ELDER LEROY MALLORY 



91 



Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth 
from the mouth of God. 

And in the revelations of the Lord to the Prophet Joseph Smith, 
he said: 

My word is sharper than a two-edged sword to the dividing asunder 
of both bone and marrow. 

I never listen to any philosophies of men that cause my soul to 
respond, but when I listen to President Grant and these leaders, who 
have spoken here in this Conference, there is something that goes through 
me like a shock of electricity, and I know that the word of God is 
sharper than a two-edged sword. 

I pray to God that I may be able so to live always that my soul 
will respond to such teachings, and that I might be a power for good in 
the midst of the Saints at home, now that my work in the mission field 
is ended. 

God bless you and our leaders and the missionary cause throughout 
the worlds I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER LEROY MALLORY 

Former President of the Tahitian Mission 

My dear brothers and sisters* it is indeed a great responsibility 
for me to occupy this position. I pray that during the few moments 
I stand here I may have the Spirit of the Lord to help me. 

I am indeed grateful to have had the honor to labor for seven 
years in the Tahitian Mission among some of the most wonderful 
people on this earth. I am thankful for the many things that they 
have taught me. I love them as I do my own kin. I bring you 
greetings and best wishes from them. The greatest desire in their 
hearts is to have the honor some day of meeting in person the Gen- 
eral Authorities of this Church. They would love to come to our 
temples to do the work for their dead. They are praying every day 
for that opportunity. 

Our people are faithful and sincere. They have the faith of a 
small child. They kneel in prayer in absolute — I was going to say, 
knowledge that their prayers will be answered. I have seen their 
sick healed almost instantly. 

Our missionaries in that field are doing a splendid work, al- 
though we have many hardships to contend with, and much travel- 
ing. Those in our ranks have been few, but they have been faithful. 
They have done a splendid work. They are still doing a splendid 
work. 

We were certainly happy to have Brother Woodbury come into 
the field to direct them. He is a splendid man, and he is loved by 
those people. His good wife, I am sure, will do much to help the 
work along in that mission. 

The last four years have been years of depression, but not- 
withstanding that condition our people have been faithful. They 



92 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



have faithfully paid from their earnings their tithes and offerings, 
although they have not amounted to much in dollars and cents. In 
the last four years they have constructed five chapels in the mission. 
Many of the rocks used in construction were carried for long dis- 
tances, upon the shoulders of our brothers and our sisters. I am 
sure, if you understood the conditions under which those chapels 
were erected, you would admire the faith and devotion of those dear 
people. 

You fathers and mothers who have sons in that mission, peace 
be in your hearts. Your sons are well. They are happy. They are 
glad to have had the opportunity of going to that mission. They 
have burning in their hearts a testimony of the divinity of this Gos- 
pel. They are loved by the people. There is no place in this world 
where the missionaries are more dearly loved or where their labors 
are more appreciated than they are in that field. I say the responsi- 
bility of our missionaries is great, but notwithstanding that condi- 
tion they are continuing to go forward. 

I remember an incident that happened just about a year ago. 
I was talking to one of the leading attorneys of those islands, and 
in the course of our conversation he said to me : "Mr. Mallory, you 
know I have a son who has now reached the age where he must leave 
this colony to go to school." He said : "I would like to send him 
to America. I would like very much to place him in the home of 
some good Latter-day Saint family." By the way, this gentleman 
was not a member of our Church. He said : "I know that in that 
home he would be taught the things that my wife and I would like 
to have him taught. If some day in the future this boy could return 
to us as fine, as clean a man as your missionaries who have come 
to this field, my wife and I would be the most happy parents in this 
world." 

Another time the Governor of French Oceania was making an 
inspection tour of the Lower Tuamotu group. He called on one of 
the islands on which is located one of our largest branches. As his 
ship pulled up to the wharf he was met by our twenty-seven piece 
L. D. S. band. He was escorted through the town, which he found 
clean, and the houses well painted. He found no drunkenness. He 
found the people tending to their business. He asked the Chief how 
it was, and who had taught them to do those things. He was told 
the Mormon missionaries. He called the people together and said 
to them : "You people — it makes no difference to what denomina- 
tion you belong — I ask you to listen to the advice and counsel of 
these Mormon missionaries. I promise you that if you do so you 
will continue to grow, to prosper, to have beautiful homes, a beauti- 
ful city, a nice place to live." 

Another time the same Governor was making a trip to another 
island. He wanted a certain man to be chief of that island. This 
man happened to be one of our Elders, a native missionary who was 



ELDER LEROY MALLORY 



93 



laboring on that island. In fact, he is the only man belonging to 
the Church on that island. 

When I visited the island, some time later, I asked him how it 
was that he had been chosen chief of that group of people, there be- 
ing so many people from different organizations there. He told me 
when the Administrator came he asked : "Is there any member of 
the Mormon Church here?" This man told him that he was a mem- 
ber. He said : "I would like to talk to you." The result was he was 
chosen as chief of that island. The Governor stated : "I want a man 
on whom I can depend, a man who does not drink. I know the Mor- 
mon people meet these requirements. 

May the Lord bless us here at home and help us to carry on the 
good work, as our missionaries are doing in the field. May we ever 
heed the advice and counsel of these noble men who have been 
chosen to direct this great work. May we ever be worthy and will- 
ing to do the things asked of us, in our different branches, in our 
different wards, in our stakes, and ever be found in the line of duty, 
I pray, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

EXPENSIVE AND INJURIOUS HABITS 

We are all looking for a solution of our great financial troubles. 
Here is one of the troubles that cost us approximately $7,150,000,000 
during the year 1936. The values given are approximate retail values. 

Alcohol: Between $4,000,000,000 and 5,000,000,000. 

Tobacco: Cigarets, 139,968,648,406 consumed in 1936. That means 
139.9 cigarets a minute for every minute from the birth of the Savior 
until now. 

Cigars: 4,863,191,852, or 4.8 cigars every minute from the birth of 
the Savior until now. 

18,030 tons of snuff. 

(The fire losses in the United States for the year 1936, as estimated 
by the insurance companies, were only $30,000,000.) 

Approximate retail value of tobacco consumed in the United States 
in 1936, $1,500,000,000. Worse than burning up that much property, 
because every person that used tobacco injured himself. 

Coffee and tea : Coffee, 1,739,184,000 pounds. This is equivalent to 
3 grams of caffein for every adult. 

Tea: 82,000,000 pounds. 

Retail value of coffee and tea together, approximately $650,000,000. 

Total for alcohol, tobacco, coffee, and tea, approximately $7,150,- 
000,000 or seven and a fraction dollars a minute for every minute from 
the birth of the Savior until now. 

Do you not think the Lord knew what he was talking about when he 
gave the Word of Wisdom for our temporal salvation? If you do not, 
study more, read more, pray more.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



REGARDING TILLERS OF THE SOIL 

I was delighted with what Brother Widtsoe said this morning, and 
by the way, I thank the Lord that Brother Widtsoe gave me these figures. 
I did not know that there was that much used. 

The United States of America was cradled by the plowed field — a 
capable cradle. In the days of Washington and Jefferson it is likely that 
at least four-fifths of all Americans were farm folk. From this fact our 
first statesmen took effective cues. Thomas Jefferson, preeminent among 
our bards of prose, said: 

"Cultivators of earth make the best citizens. They are the most vigor- 
ous, the most virtuous, and the most independent. They are tied to their 
country and wedded to its liberty and interests with the most lasting bonds. 

"They are not soap-box orators, not one of them. A farm is what 
makes a man loyal to his country. A soap-box orator is a man that stirs 
up trouble. 

"As long, therefore, as they can find employment in that line, I would 
not counsel them to be mariners, artizans, or anything else." 

This saying lived long as the gospel of American leadership, as well 
as of politics. 

God grant that it may return. 

A FAVORABLE MAGAZINE ARTICLE 

I have been reading from "Roots of America," by Charles Morrow 
Wilson. I hope that the majority of you have read Mr. Wilson's article 
in the September 4th issue of the Saturday Evening Post. It is one of 
the most enlightening and splendid things ever written by a non-member 
of the Church in any of our magazines. The young man came to Utah 
and was in my office a number of times, and went down to Hurricane 
and looked into the marvelous work done by the people at Hurricane. 
Then he wrote this very favorable article — one of the best I have ever 
read. 

The Choir sang "The Lord is My Refuge," after which the bene- 
diction was pronounced by Elder Thomas E. Winegar, President of 
the South Davis Stake. 

Conference adjourned until 10 o'clock a. m., Sunday, October 3. 

THIRD DAY 
MORNING MEETING 

Long before time to commence the Sunday morning session, the 
great Tabernacle auditorium and galleries were crowded to capacity, 
every available space being occupied. In addition, the large Assembly 
Hall immediately south of the Tabernacle was filled with people, and 
other thousands congregated on the Tabernacle grounds, where by means 
of amplifying equipment that had been installed, they were enabled to 
listen to the Conference proceedings as they were broadcast from the 
Tabernacle. 

Conference reconvened promptly at 10 o'clock. President Heber 
J. Grant, who presided, opened the meeting and announced that the 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



95 



Tabernacle Choir and the congregation would sing the hymn, "Oh, Say, 
What Is Truth?" 

After the singing of this hymn, the opening prayer was offered by 
Elder H. Clay Cummings, President of the Wasatch Stake.

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

There are only five minutes left until time for us to turn the 
Conference over to the Choir recital. I do not want to ask any one 
to occupy that short period of time, so I shall do so myself. I am happy 
indeed to see this marvelous congregation. Not only are all of the seats 
taken, but people are standing up in the galleries and in the aisles below. 
It is a great evidence to me of the growth of the work of the Lord in 
our day. I think it is perhaps the largest audience that I remember 
to have seen crowded into this building at a Conference session, and 
I am grateful for this. 

A CHOICE LAND 

I am very thankful that I am not in the least pessimistic or at all 
alarmed about the work of the Lord. I am a firm believer that this 
country, both North and South America, is the choice land of the world, 
a land choice above all other lands, according to the words of the 



98 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



prophets in the Book of Mormon. I believe in its final destiny. I 
believe that there is an over-ruling Providence protecting this country. 
I believe that this is the only place in the United States of America 
where the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints could have been 
established and continued without the most terrible persecution, worse 
than anything we ever had. 

FAITH IN DIVINITY OF THE GOSPEL 

I am very thankful indeed for the remarkable men and women 
that we have in the Church, who are devoting their lives without 
hesitancy to the advancement of the kingdom of God on earth. I 
am very thankful indeed, in my eighty-first year (I will be eighty-one 
years old in a little more than a month), that from my childhood days 
till now I have never found anything that has in the least degree weakened 
my faith in the divinity of this work. I am very thankful that faith 
is a gift from God, and that gift came to me in my young manhood. 
There came into my heart at that time an abiding testimony that the 
Book of Mormon is exactly what it purports to be. I read that book 
through as a boy, prayerfully and numbly, and there came into my 
very being — that part of me that will exist when my body is placed 
in mother earth — an absolute assurance that that book is exactly what 
it purports to be. To my mind, the Book of Mormon is the greatest 
tract, the greatest preacher of the Gospel of Jesus Christ of all the 
literature that we have. That book has stood the test for over a hundred 
years, notwithstanding the abuse and ridicule that have been brought 
against it; year after year additional evidences are coming regarding 
the divinity of that book. 

I remember when first they said, "Oh, it is a falsehood because 
it says the people who lived on this continent anciently had horses, 
and no remains of horses have been found." Since that time we have 
found in the great oil fields of California remains of horses. 

SKILLFUL IN USE OF CEMENT 

People ridiculed me because I believed that those people had erected 
cement nouses; they said that there had never been a cement house 
found. Since that time cement houses have been uncovered by the 
score. A great monument upon which my Counselor J. Reuben Clark, Jr., 
and my former Counselor Anthony W. Ivins, stood, covers eleven acres 
of ground — ten per cent more than this Tabernacle block, and as I re- 
member it, is is one hundred and fifty percent higher than this building. 
The outside of this great monument is cement, and people have dug 
down into the earth in front of this monument and have found a fine 
cement road, showing a skill in the use of cement equal, if not the 
superior, to what we have today. And additional evidences are coming 
all the time. 

THE INEXPLICABLE EXPLAINED 

When I was in England, presiding over the European Mission, 
I was entertained by the assistant manager of the great New York Life 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



99 



Insurance Company in London, and one of the guests at that dinner 
was a man who had been connected with the British Legation. He had 
been to Canada a number of times and to United States many times. 
He said to me: "Mr. Grant, I saw the most inexplicable thing in my 
life when I was way up in Canada beyond the bounds of civilization, 
among those heathen Indians. I found an exact copy of a Holy Land rug, 
woven in small beads, the exact pattern of what I had seen in the Holy 
Land. How under heaven those Indians up there who had never heard 
of Jerusalem could duplicate a Holy Land rug is beyond my compre- 
hension." 

I said : "I will give you a copy of the Book of Mormon and you will 
find that the forefathers of the American Indians came from Jerusalem." 
"What?" he said. "That explains the inexplicable." 

GRATEFUL FOR GROWTH OF CHURCH 

I rejoice beyond my powers of expression for the growth of the 
Church of Jesus Christ. I am grateful for this magnificent audience. 
I am thankful for the opportunity that our Choir has each Sabbath of 
broadcasting their splendid music, and it is doing more, I believe, to 
create good will for the Latter-day Saints than any of the missionary 
work we have established. 

May the Lord bless every one of us who has a testimony of the 
divinity of the work in which we are engaged to so order our lives that 
our integrity, upright devotion to the work of God will preach the Gospel, 
is my prayer and I ask it in the name of our Redeemer and Savior, Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

TABERNACLE CHOIR AND ORGAN BROADCAST 

During the period from 10:30 to 11 :00 the following program of 
choral and organ music was presented by the Tabernacle Choir and 
Organ, which program was broadcast by radio throughout the United 
States and Canada through the courtesy of the Columbia Broadcasting

of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints the following program was pre- 
sented on the Columbia Broadcasting System's regularly scheduled 
Church of the Air series : 

The Choir and congregation joined in singing the hymn, "The 
Spirit of God like a Fire is Burning." 

"Prayer," (Hansel and Gretel) was sung by the ladies of the Taber- 
nacle Choir. 

PRESIDENT DAVID O. McKAY 

Second Counselor in the First Presidency 

APPLIED CHRISTIANITY 

What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and 
have not works? Can faith save him. — (James 2:14.) 

In this significant passage, James decries the impotency of faith 
as a merely intellectual perception, and implies the importance of the 
application of truth to daily life and conduct. He teaches that "faith 
is dead and useless unless it expresses itself in a true life and true 
Christian activities." There has been, and is today, too much discrepancy 
between belief and practice, between the proclamation of high ideals and 
the application of these ideals to daily life and living. 

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, accepting Christ as 
the revelation of God to man, believes that Jesus in his life and teachings 
reveals a standard of personal living, and of social relations, which, if 
fully embodied in individual lives and in human institutions, would not 
only ameliorate the present ills of society, but bring happiness and peace 
to mankind. 

If it be urged that during the past two thousand years so-called 
Christian nations have failed to achieve such a goal, we answer that all 
failure to do so may be found in the fact that they have failed to apply 
the principles and teachings of true Christianity 

DENOTE OBLIGATION 

To every sincere follower of Christ religion should denote not only 
a sense of relationship to God, but also an expression of that feeling in 
actions with respect to right and wrong, and obligation to duty. 

This was undoubtedly the kind of religion Patrick Henry had in 
mind when, in the closing scene of his life, he said: "I have now dis- 
posed of all my property to my family. There is one thing more I wish 
I could give them, and that is the Christian religion. If they had that, 
and I had not given them one shilling, they would be rich ; and if they 
had not that, and I had given them all the world, they would be poor." 

Pure religion gives one power to rise above the selfish, sensual, sordid 
life of what Eucken calls "pure nature," and enables one to "experience 
a divinity in life above and beyond the world of sensible reality." 

"Without this religion," this philosopher continues, "no true civil- 



PRESIDENT DAVID 0. McKAY 



101 



ization is possible. A civilization declining all contact with a supernatural 
life and refusing to establish those mysterious inner relations, gradually 
becomes a parody of civilization." 

STANDARDS VIOLATED 

For six thousand years and more the human family has suffered 
from unrestrained expressions and manifestations of selfishness, hatred, 
envy, greed — animal passions that have led to war, devastation, pes- 
tilence, and death. If the simplest principles of the Savior's teachings had 
been observed the recent world war, for example, could have been averted. 
The nation or nations that began that holocaust violated some standard 
or standards of the Christian religion — with what result ? Seven million 
men killed. Five million more dead of starvation and disease. Twenty 
million wounded, five million of whom are maimed and crippled for life. 
Six million men imprisoned. Twenty million women in Europe deprived 
of a home of their own. Countless millions who suffered privations in 
the trenches, and in lonely homes of the poor. Fifty billion dollars worth 
of material and property destroyed. One hundred billion dollars to 
provide for the cost of the war and interest. 

And even now as the passing of time dims the memory of that ter- 
rible experience, we again hear rumblings of threatened and deadly 
conflict. Indeed, actually today in some parts of the world horrors are 
being enacted that make the soul shudder. Innocent human beings, non- 
combatants, helplessly, desperately fleeing to save their lives, are blown 
to pieces by death-dealing missiles from the air. Children left homeless, 
maimed, and slaughtered indiscriminately; starving mothers seeking to 
give away their famishing babes if by so doing they can save their lives. 
Because these atrocities are 6,000 or 8,000 miles away, we fail to sense 
fully the horror of it all. But imagine if they were here, and your boy 
or girl, your mother, wife, or babe were subjected to such peril ! If there 
be a means of averting such calamities, plain common sense, to say 
nothing of religion's appeal, would prompt its acceptance. These things 
but emphasize the truth of what Hayden writes : 

Today, as seldom if ever before, human society is threatened with 
disintegration, if not complete chaos. All the ancient evils of human re- 
lationships, injustice, selfishness, abuse of strength, become sinister and 
terrible when reinforced by the vast increase of material power. The soul 
of man cowers, starved and fearful, in the midst of a civilization grown 
too complex for any mind to visualize or to control. Joy and beauty fade 
from human life. Yet life, abundant, beauteous laughing life, has been 
our age-long labor's end. What other conceivable worth has the mastery 
of the material world, the exploitation of the resources of nature and the 
creation of wealth, except as a basis for the release of the life of the 
spirit ? 

What he says merits careful consideration. 

VIOLATIONS AT HOME 

But we need not cross oceans to see the effects of violations of 
Christian ideals. Crime in our own country is costing about fourteen 



102 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



billion dollars a year — all in disregard of Gospel teachings and ethics. 
"Can you imagine," says the author of The Builders of America, "what 
this country would be like if ten or twenty billion dollars a year were 
added to our national income? Even if you can imagine the result do 
you realize what it would be like to feel no need of locking doors and 
windows, no fear of leaving your car unprotected, no danger that your 
wife or daughter would be insulted, or you yourself sandbagged if you 
went out at night ; no fear that you would have any uncollectable bills 
except through accident or unpreventable misfortune ; no fear that in a 
political election there would be any bribery, or in politics any graft, 
and no fear that anyone anywhere was trying to 'do you' — Can you 
imagine all that? It would be heaven on earth! Of course, it cannot 
happen. Yet if all the destroyers of civilization could be eliminated, and 
if the traits of the rest of us that come from destructive strains could 
be eliminated, an approach to such a state some hundreds of years hence 
is by no means inconceivable." Let me again emphasize that such a 
desirable state of human society is possible through obedience to Gospel 
principles. 

If you are now thinking that the application of Christ's teaching is 
impracticable under modern conditions, let me ask you to bring to mind 
a few specific examples of people who have devoted themselves to the 
common good. Recall the life of Florence Nightingale, and a million 
others like her, unheralded and unsung. Think of the Red Cross, a com- 
paratively .recent organization among Christian nations. Think of 
Abraham Lincoln, consecrating his life to his country. 

If still you are doubtful, consider the humble life and great achieve- 
ments of Dr. George Washington Carver, "who has done more than any 
other living man to rehabilitate agriculture in the South," refusing a 
proffered salary of $100,000, preferring to devote his talents and energy 
to the benefit of his fellowmen 

Christianity applied to daily life! 

WILLINGNESS TO SERVE 

This willingness to serve others is ready for expression in the hearts 
of millions, if only nations or groups in nations will but point the way. 
Here is a recent illustration : September 19, 1937, the Salt Lake Region 
of the Church Security Plan, finding itself in need of a new store house, 
held a special Fast Day for the purpose of raising funds with which to 
make the first payment. The committee asked the people to go without 
two meals on that day and contribute the equivalent in cash for the 
project. The leaders anticipated raising about $4,000. The people con- 
tributed over $15,000 — realization exceeding anticipation nearly four 
times ! 

The Church worshiping in this renowned Tabernacle today accepts 
as literally true the saying of Jesus : 

I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it 
more abundantly 



PRESIDENT DAVID 0. McKAY 



103 



We believe, however, that this abundant life is obtained not only 
from spiritual exaltation, but by the application to daily life of the 
principles that Jesus taught. 

SIMPLE PRINCIPLES 

These principles are few and simple and may, if desired, be applied 
by every normal person. The first of these, and the foundation upon 
which a true Christian society is built, is: 

Love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, mind and strength. 
A belief in a Supreme Being who lives and loves his children — a 
belief that gives power and vigor to the soul. An assurance that he can 
be approached for guidance, and that he will manifest himself to those 
who seek him. 

Another is : The acceptance of the truth that life is a gift of God, 
and therefore divine. The proper use of this gift impels man to become 
the master, not the slave of nature. His appetites are to be controlled 
and used for the benefit of his health and the prolongation of life. His 
passions mastered and controlled for the happiness and blessing of others, 
and the perpetuity of the race. 

A third principle is: Personal Integrity. By this I mean, plain, 
everyday honesty, sobriety, and respect for others' rights, such as will 
win the confidence of one's fellows. This recognition applies to nations 
as well as to individuals. It is as wrong for a nation, because it is pow- 
erful, to steal from another and oppress it, as it is for an individual to 
rob and kill his neighbor. 

A fourth essential is: Social Consciousness that awakens in each 
individual the realization that it is his duty to make the world better for 
his having been in it. The very heart and spirit of this standard is ex- 
pressed in the statement of the Prophet Joseph Smith — "If my life is 
of no value to my friends, it is of no value to me." 

Some day intelligent human beings will realize the importance and 
benefit of living in right relations one with another. When that time 
comes the Savior's prayer will be in people's hearts — "Make them one, 
as thou Father and I are one" — Then when that time comes "the war- 
drum will throb no longer and the battle flags be furled in the Parliament 
of Man, the Federation of the world." 

This condition can be achieved not alone from mere belief, nor from 
oratorical exhortations, but by the application in business, social and 
national life of the principles of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. 

A male chorus sang the hymn, "I'll Go Where You Want Me to 
Go, dear Lord." 

The hymn, "High on the Mountain Top," was sung by the Taber- 
nacle Choir and the congregation. 



At the conclusion of the Church of the Air broadcast, at the request 
of President Heber J. Grant the congregation arose and joined with 
the Choir in singing two verses of the hymn, "God Moves in a Mysterious 
Way."

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

There have been counted inside the Tabernacle today 11,213 people. 
In addition, there are 1,800 in the Assembly Hall, and 3,000 on the 
grounds — a grand total of 16,013. 

PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 

First Counselor in the First Presidency 

My brothers and sisters, I am indeed blessed with you in the oppor- 
tunity to be at this great Conference and at these wonderful services this 
morning. I glory with you in the ringing, honest testimony of President 
Grant. I rejoice with you in the wonderful message of President McKay, 
embodying in it those principles which would bring into the world, if 
practiced, peace and joy unexpressible. 

I again rejoice with you in the great work of this choir of ours 
and of our other musical organizations, the Singing Mothers, the Nebo 
Stake Choir who entertained and edified us yesterday, and the male 
chorus. I am sure I express your gratitude as well as my own and 
that of the Authorities when I thank Brother J. Spencer Cornwall for 
his untiring efforts and Brother Frank W. Asper and also, and perhaps 
especially, Brother Richard L. Evans. Sunday after Sunday, year in 
and year out, he prepares what is called the "continuity" to these broad- 
casts. His versatility arouses my admiration and my gratitude. 

AN OUTSTANDING SCOUT LEADER 

I would like to say a word about another man whom Brother Grant 
has mentioned and whom I think we do not fully appreciate. I am 
thinking of Brother Oscar A. Kirkham. Sometimes I wonder if he 
does not all too much indicate the truthfulness of that old saying, "A 
prophet is not without honor save in his own country." I do not know 
how Brother Oscar Kirkham stands with the superior officers of the 
Boy Scout Movement, but I suppose he stands well. I do know how he 
stands with the Boy Scouts of America. I saw him recently at the 
Jamboree in Washington. After the officers of the organization had 
attempted in vain to bring to silence and order 25,000 boys assembled 
there under the shadow of the great Washington Monument, I saw 
Brother Kirkham go forward on the platform, raise his hands, and bring 
silence to those 25,000 boys in less than half a minute. His influence for 
good in this world and in the Boy Scout Movement cannot be overesti- 
mated and I honor him and respect him for the work which he is doing. 

TRIBUTE TO CHOIR 

This choir of ours, I think, is the greatest missionary unit which we 
have. Wherever I go, on both sides of the Atlantic, I hear praiseworthy 
reference to their efforts. I am grateful to the Lord for them. It is 
rather an interesting fact to me that on this block should be the two great 



PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 105 



missionary units of the Church. I am thinking of the choir and its work 
and I am thinking of the work of Brother Joseph S. Peery in the Temple 
Block Mission. We are planning and hoping to intensify the work of 
hoth of these agencies. After listening to this congregation sing this 
morning, I think I am entitled to say that also the body of this Church 
assembled in these Conferences is a center from which radiates the Spirit 
of the Lord and the Spirit of righteousness. No base community or 
people could, sing as you sing. Your songs are filled with a feeling of 
righteousness. They come, do these songs, from a God-fearing, faithful 
people. God grant that always shall we be able to sing the songs of 
Zion and radiate the spirit which has come from this great audience 
this morning. 

Along with Brother Grant, I had the pleasure of attending some of 
the meetings of the Saints in foreign lands. Sister Clark and I made 
some tour of Europe. We come back to you, I am glad to say, enriched 
in our spirit and increased in our knowledge. No one can appraise the 
beneficial work which President Grant did in Europe. I am happy to 
add my own feeling to the expressions which he gave voice to yesterday — 
that too long have we remained somewhat aloof from those organizations 
of ours on the other side of the water and in the islands of the sea. I 
rejoice in his determination that from now on we shall bring them nearer 
to us and shall strive for a fuller realization of the fact that they are 
part and parcel of us. 

SIMPLICITY OF WORSHIP 

I return to you filled with gratitude for many, many things. I am 
grateful for the fact that our services are simple and in the line of the 
services which the Savior himself inaugurated when he was on the earth. 
I rejoice beyond my powers of expression that our worship is not one of 
great magnificence. I rejoice that our Church calls upon the individuals 
of its membership to carry on all of its activities — that there is nothing 
which is withheld from him or from her who is righteous. 

I rejoice in the fact that our buildings are simple and that we come 
into them for the purpose of worship and not for the purpose of admira- 
tion. I hope I shall not be misunderstood, nor that I shall be thought 
to lack charity or respect for others, but I hope the time will never 
come when we shall have a St. Peter's or a St. Paul's edifice connected 
with this Church. They would lead us away from the simplicity which 
keeps us humble. 

A LIVING FAITH 

Above all, I am grateful for the simplicity of our faith. We do 
not believe in, nor live in, a morgue or graveyard of Christian principles 
which have supposedly been tried and found wanting, nor of blasted 
hopes. On the contrary, we have a living faith ; a faith that guides us 
day by day and hour by hour; a faith that will lead us, if lived, back 



106 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



into the presence of our Heavenly Father; a faith that, lived here, will 
bring us a joy and a contentment that is beyond the power of any human 
pen or tongue to describe. 

GRATEFUL FOR OUR COUNTRY 

I am grateful, also, as I return to this country, for our country itself. 
I am grateful for its territorial aloofness from the rest of the world. 
Even with the most modern, destructive weapons of war, we are almost 
immune. I am grateful for our political international aloofness and I 
pray our Heavenly Father that we shall never lose the security which 
comes from minding our own business and remaining aloof from the 
quarrels and the pettiness of the politics of the world. 

I am grateful for our economic sufficiency — that we can, within our 
own borders, produce all that we need for our daily lives, and the most 
of what we need for our luxury. The need of other great powers for 
this sufficiency threatens to bring sometime in the future another devas- 
tating struggle. 

I am grateful to my Heavenly Father for our free institutions, for 
the liberty which we have, the freedom of the press, the freedom of 
religion, freedom to do as we wish within the law. I am grateful that 
the great principle behind our system of government is that we may 
do anything which the law does not forbid. There are other systems 
in the world in which the individual may do that only which the law 
permits, and between those two great principles lies the difference be- 
tween freedom and slavery. I am grateful for this, my brethren and 
sisters, far beyond my power to tell. 

SECURITY PROGRAM IS SUCCESSFUL 

I want to say a word about our Security Program. I want to say 
to you brothers and sisters that the Security Program is highly successful. 
Bishop Cannon has furnished figures to show that during the first six 
months of this year almost 25,000 Latter-day Saints were helped directly 
or through work and there is no letting up. There are still a few who 
must be taken care of, off the government relief. If government projects 
shall be abandoned, there will be more. But if we shall do in the future 
as we have in the past we shall meet the task that lies ahead. 

Over and over again the last four and one-half years I have told 
you what I firmly believe — that we, if we put into practice the principles 
of our religion and if we utilize the organization which the Lord has 
provided us for taking care of our own, we should become an ensign 
and an example, a city upon a hill pointing the way to the rest of the 
world. If you read your papers and your magazines, you know that 
this has come to pass and people now are asking — they ask me on all 
sides : What is it in your organizations that brings you the ability to 
do these things ? That, my brethren and sisters, brings up the next great 
point which we wish the world to look at. 

What is the source of this unifying power that motivates this great 



PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 



107 



people ? And when that question is answered, it will be understood and 
known that it is the power of the Lord and the power of the Priesthood 
among this people that- does draw them together ; that does unite them 
as a single man. I want to say here that I am very grateful to all who 
have taken part in carrying on this security program — the men and the 
women who have worked in the Relief Society, and all the auxiliary 
agencies, the Priesthood, and particularly those men o'f the central com- 
mittee who so willingly give their time, without compensation, to the 
supervision of this great and vital undertaking. We thank you all for 
your cooperation and for your support. Without it nothing at all could 
have been done. 

GIVES ADMONITION 

May I add again an admonition : Live within your means. Get out 
of debt. Keep out of debt. Lay by for a rainy day which has always 
come and will come again. Practice and increase your habits of thrift, 
industry, economy, frugality. Remember that the parable of the ten 
virgins, the five that were wise and the five that were foolish, can be 
just as applicable to matters of the temporal world as those of the spiritual. 

My brethren and sisters, our revelations are filled, revelations ancient 
and modern, with the statement that this work of the Lord is to roll 
forth as the stone cut out of the mountain without hands, and fill the 
whole earth. This Gospel of ours, my brethren and sisters, is not merely 
for us. It is, said the Lord, in his time for every creature in the world. 
The Lord has given to us the responsibility of trying to bring home 
to humanity the truths of this Gospel, not by exhortation alone, because 
exhortation has failed and that is why men tell you that the principles 
of Christianity are dead. But we are to bring this home to humanity 
by living it. This great responsibility the Lord has placed primarily upon 
us in America. But this is not an American Church. This is the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and its destiny as well as its mission 
is to fill the earth and to bring home to every man, woman and child in 
the world the truths of this Gospel of which I have spoken. 

OUR MISSION 

My brothers and sisters, that requires not only devotion to duty of 
the very highest character but it requires sacrifice. There is no good 
comes into the world, there is no good comes to the individual which in 
some way does not demand a sacrifice. Righteousness must pay the 
price. 

May the Lord bless us. May he bring into our hearts an understand- 
ing of the mission of the Church and beyond that of the mission of the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ. May he particularly bring into our hearts an 
understanding of our own responsibilities and duties, because if we fail 
to meet them, not only shall we ourselves suffer and fail to get the 
blessings that come from obedience, but someone in the world somewhere 



108 GENERAL CONFERENCE 



will hold against us the charge that we did not meet our duty and bring to 
him the principles which we believe. 

And so may God be with us at all times and help us in all ways 
that we may do his will ; that we may spread the Gospel ; that we may point 
to all humanity the way to temporal salvation, not only, as we are trying 
to do now, but spiritual salvation and exaltation also, is my prayer in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I have been invited to attend conferences of the foreign-speaking 
peoples. I want the Dutch people to know that I am Dutch when I go 
far enough back on my mother's side, so I am interested in the Dutch 
people. There are some Scandinavians in my family through marriage, 
so I am interested in the Scandinavians. The German people have 
given to us some of our most stalwart and outstanding people, and I 
am deeply interested in them; but I beg these dear friends of mine to 
please remember that in a little more than a month I will be 81 years 
of age, and that when a man my age attends each of these General 
Conference sessions he is doing all that he should. You are all praying 
for the Lord to prolong my life. Please do not ask me to do things that 
will shorten it. 

"Doxology" was sung by the Tabernacle Choir and the congregation. 
Elder Arnold D. Miller, President of the North Davis Stake, offered 
the closing prayer. 

Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock. 



THIRD DAY 
AFTERNOON MEETING 

The concluding session of the Conference was held Sunday after- 
noon, October 3, at 2 o'clock. 

Once more, the great Tabernacle was filled to capacity with people, 
and again throngs of people congregated in the Assembly Hall and on 
the Tabernacle grounds to listen to the 'services as they were broadcast 
from the Tabernacle. 

The Tabernacle Choir sang an anthem, "Send Forth Thy Light," 
after which the opening prayer was offered by Elder Samuel G. Dye, 
President of the Ogden Stake. 

An anthem, "Beautiful Savior," was sung by the Choir, Jessie 
Evans, soloist. 



PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAW SON 109 



PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAWSON 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

As I listened to the broadcast this morning and looked out upon 
this great congregation of people, I was nearly swept off my feet; I 
think I would have been had I been standing. It was a wonderful 
meeting. 

This is also a great gathering of Latter-day Saints, filling the entire 
Tabernacle, a congregation that is eager for the word of the Lord and 
are here now to wait upon him. 

A REMARKABLE BOOK 

I have in my hand a most remarkable book. There is nothing 
exactly like it in all the great libraries of the world. This book is dis- 
tinctive, it is different from any other record under the heavens. In 
fact, it contains one hundred and thirty-five revelations given to Joseph 
Smith the Prophet for the instruction of the members of the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, given by the Master himself. 

And yet in our day and time it is declared by Christians generally 
that the voice of revelation has ceased being heard in the land. This 
book is not to be handled with the spirit of indifference. It justifies 
the deepest consideration and study. Three or four or five years of 
intense application in the study of this book, the Doctrine and Covenants, 
would be the equivalent to a university education in the higher brackets. 

We cannot speak lightly of a book with such solemn and important 
instructions as are given in this volume which covers every phase of the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ. In a matter so extremely important, my brethren 
and sisters, would we not be justified in pausing for a few moments to 
consider and reflect upon some of these great commandments of the 
Lord. 

REVELATION ON THE THREE GLORIES 

I refer you now to Section 76. In this section the kingdoms of 
glory of the other world are set forth in great force and beauty. I would 
like to read to you the introduction to this particular revelation given by 
the Lord: 

Hear, O ye heavens, and give ear, O earth, and rejoice ye inhabitants 
thereof, for the Lord is God, and beside him there is no Savior. 

Great is his wisdom, marvelous are his ways, and the extent of his 
doings none can find out 

His purposes fail not, neither are there any who can stay his hand. 

From eternity to eternity he is the same, and his years never fail. 

For thus saith the Lord — I, the Lord, am merciful and gracious unto 
those who fear me, and delig-ht to honor those who serve me in righteous- 
ness and in truth unto the end. 

Great shall be their reward and eternal shall be their glory. 

And to them will I reveal all mysteries, yea, all the hidden mysteries 
of my kingdom from days of old, and for ages to come, will I make known 
unto them the good pleasure of my will concerning all things pertaining 
to my kingdom. 



110 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Yea, even the wonders of eternity shall they know, and things to 
come will I show them, even the things of many generations. 

And their wisdom shall be great, and their understanding reach to 
heaven; and before them the wisdom of the wise shall perish, and the 
understanding of the prudent shall come to naught. 

For by my Spirit will I enlighten them, and by my power will I make 
known unto them the secrets of my will — yea, even those things which 
eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor yet entered into the heart of man. 

Are not these words, being the preface to a revelation, great and 
mighty words ? The Lord describes himself and his power and greatness 
and ability to bless and save in these few introductory lines. 

Now, this revelation sets forth three great kingdoms of glory, and 
the people in the Church, yes, and those of the world at large may 
choose therefrom their destiny for the hereafter. And, should one 
step forth the following question might consistently be put to him: 
"What destiny do you aspire to ?" The answer might be, "Well, I would 
like a Celestial glory, which I understand is the highest and best." The 
sun, moon and stars are pointed to in the revelation as being typical of 
the three kingdoms of glory, and as the sun differs from the moon in 
brightness so is the Celestial kingdom of glory ; and as the moon differs 
from the stars in brightness so is the Terrestrial glory, and as the stars 
differ one from another in brightness so it is in the Telestial kingdom 
of glory. If you can abide the law of the Celestial kingdom, why, then 
you can abide a Celestial glory and that glory will be given you. Other- 
wise, you must look for some other kingdom of glory such as the 
Terrestrial or Telestial, but remember that if your worthiness should 
entitle you to a Telestial kingdom only it is due to the fact that you are 
able to abide the law of the Telestial kingdom. 

Permit me to read a few words from this section to show what 
is required of those who will be saved in the Celestial kingdom of God : 

And again we bear record — for we saw and heard, and this is the 
testimony of the gospel of Christ concerning them who shall come forth 
in the resurrection of the just— 

They are they who received the testimony of Jesus, and believed 
on his name and were baptized after the manner of his burial, being buried 
in the water in his name, and this according to the commandment which 
he has given— 

That by keeping the commandments they might be washed and cleansed 
from all their sins, and receive the Holy Spirit by the laying on of the 
hands of him who is ordained and sealed unto this power; 

And who overcome by faith, and are sealed by the Holy Spirit of 
promise, which the Father sheds forth upon all those who are just and 
true. 

They are they who are the church of the Firstborn. 

They are they into whose hands the Father has given all things — 

They are they who are priests and kings, who have received of his 
fulness, and of his glory; 

And are priests of the Most High, after the order of Melchizedek, 
which was after the order of Enoch, which was after the order of the 
Only Begotten Son. 

Wherefore, as it is written, they are gods, even the sons of God. 

Wherefore, all things are theirs, whether life or death, or things 



PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAWSON 111 



present, or things to come, all are theirs and they are Christ's, and Christ 
is God's. 

Now, brethren and sisters, you see what is before you ; you see 
what it will require upon your part to obtain the Celestial glory. If 
you cannot live up to the requirements of this law that governs in the 
Celestial kingdom, though you may have membership in the Church, 
you cannot abide that glory. That is the edict. The Lord tells us that in 
Section 88. 

Section 76 is a great revelation. We can sit down by ourselves 
and determine just which glory will satisfy us and how we can obtain 
it, and we are left without excuse. This great revelation appears in the 
book, and it is worthy of study and deep reflection. Each one must 
determine whether his life squares with the conditions; and this is only 
one of the many great revelations contained in this book of Doctrine 
and Covenants. 

REVELATION ON PRIESTHOOD 

In Section 84, a revelation on Priesthood, we find the duties that 
go with the Priesthood, the duties of the Presidency of the Church, the 
duties of the Council of the Twelve, and the First Council of Seventy 
set forth in clearness. It defines the duties of Patriarch, High Priest, 
Seventy, Elder, Bishop, Priest, Teacher and Deacon. The whole field 
of official standing in the Church comes within the purview of this 
important section. 

We had a great body of Priesthood here last night. This building 
was filled to its utmost capacity. Some were standing. It is the duty 
of the Priesthood of the Church to study these great revelations, par- 
ticularly Section 84. Are you familiar with it? Have you a Doctrine 
and Covenants within reach? Not in the library case, but on the table 
where you can get at it handily? You ought to give time to this matter 
and to the importance of the Priesthood, the necessity of magnifying it, 
because it represents divine authority, and brethren, we cannot trifle 
with divine authority. When the Lord speaks we must take notice, 
and when he commands we must obey, because it is the Lord who is 
the law-giver, and he who becomes a law unto himself, if he does not 
repent, is lost. 

REVELATION ON THE ETERNITY OF THE MARRIAGE COVENANT 

And then there is Section 132 — a revelation upon marriage. It 
speaks of the eternity of the marriage covenant. I wonder if our young 
people who are thinking of marriage are thinking about that feature of 
it ? Here is an opportunity for the young people to use great discrimina- 
tion. Marriage should be approached in a prayerful spirit. We should 
pause and consider ■ this matter. Sometimes it happens that a couple 
will pass the Temple door and go and get a civil marriage, and I have 
wondered sometimes if such a couple had weighed the matter fully. 



112 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



There is as much difference between a Temple marriage and a 
civil marriage as there is between the sun and the moon. A civil marriage 
is a good marriage because it has the authority of the United States 
government behind it. The law protects it, and we cannot condemn it. 
All we can say about a civil marriage is that it is good as far as it goes, 
but it may not go very far. That is the trouble. It may last a month, 
it may last six months, it may last ten years, or twenty years, or thirty 
years, or forty, or fifty years, which is just a moment of time. 

Now, there is the Temple marriage which covers time and all 
eternity. There is going to be a good deal of sorrow, a good deal of 
anxiety come into the lives of those who accept the inferior marriage 
because there is bound to be a separation of loved ones. A civil marriage 
applies only to this life and holds good until death parts them. If the 
husband dies, the bond is broken. If the wife dies, the bond is broken ; 
and if both die the bond is broken. It does not reach beyond this life. 
That is a matter that should have our deepest consideration, because 
after all, the rewards that come from marriage are governed by law 
like other things, and we are living under the operation of law in all 
things. 

REVELATION ON TITHING 

There is the law of finance, the divine law of finance given to the 
Church. Somebody might say : "I have not seen that law, Brother Claw- 
son. I have not read very much of the book of Covenants, but I have 
not seen that law, or any law entitled the law of finance." 

Well, it may not have that title. Nevertheless the revelation on 
tithing is the law of finance in the Church of Christ. That is the way 
the Lord deals with us in relation to some financial things. 

It is wonderful, this law of finance. When the Church was in great 
distress some years ago, was upon the verge of bankruptcy, the law of 
finance was put into operation and stressed by the Authorities, and it 
brought the Church out of its difficulties. It must needs be that we 
give attention to this law of finance. And there is a reward that goes 
with it too. 

THE WORD OF WISDOM 

Then there is the great law of health. "Well," someone might say 
"I have not seen a revelation entitled the great law of health, Brother 
Clawson." 

"No, of course you have not. But you have seen the revelation that 
is entitled the Word of Wisdom, haven't you ?" 
"Yes." 

"Well, that is the law of health, given by the Lord many years 
ago. It is wonderful what it has done for the people, and it is surprising 
that it has not done more for them, but that is the fault of the people 
who have failed to obey this law." 



PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAWSON 113 



THE APPEARANCE OF THE SAVIOR IN THE KIRTLAND TEMPLE 

And then there is an account in Section 1 10 of the great vision that 
was given to the Prophet Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery in the 
Kirtland Temple at the time of its dedication, when the Lord Jesus 
Christ appeared standing upon the breastwork of the pulpit. His ap- 
pearance was glorious, but his words were more glorious, and his par- 
ticular word upon that occasion was grand and beautiful. He said to 
them : 

I am the first and the last ; I am he who liveth, I am he who was 
slain; I am your advocate with the Father. Behold, your sins are forgiven 
you; you are clean before me; therefore lift up your heads and rejoice, etc. 

Marvelous were these divine words of comfort and mercy given 
to the Saints of God by the Lord himself. They were fully rewarded for 
the great sacrifices they had made in building the Kirtland Temple. 

STUDY OF STANDARD WORKS URGED 

I must not take any more of your time. Brethren and sisters, let 
me plead with you to give more attention to the standard works of the 
Church. There is so much literature that comes into our homes, I am 
sure, that we can hardly reach the standard works of the Church, yet 
the standard works should come first, and other literature afterwards. 

Of course, we must keep track of daily events, things that are going 
on in the world, but when it comes to reading books of interest and 
value, let us give preference to the Church works because they are more 
precious than any other books in the world. If they were wiped out 
entirely and not one standard Church book left, it would be a calamity, 
a great misfortune to the Church 

God bless you, brethren and sisters, is my prayer in the name 
of Jesus Christ, Amea 

ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

I desire to express a word of appreciation and thanks to and for 
this wonderful choir. My faith and prayers are with the members. 

A PERFECT ORGANIZATION 

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is a wonderful or- 
ganization. In the year 1829 the Lord said that a great and marvelous 
work was about to come forth among the children of men. That was 
a few months before the organization of the Church. In the branches, 
wards and stakes, all presided over by properly appointed officers, we 
have a perfect organization in theory. I wish I could say that in regard 
to the practice. 

We have a perfect order of Priesthood, because it is divine. It is 



114 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



not man-made. The Bishop in the ward holds the keys of presidency, 
and the power to direct and set in order all things within his ward. 
Likewise the Presidency of the stake hold the keys of presidency, and 
it is their duty to set in order and regulate all things pertaining to 
the stake over which they preside. The President of the Church holds 
the keys of authority for the whole Church. He is the mouthpiece 
of God. It is through him that revelation comes for the guidance of 
the members. 

OUR DUTY TO HONOR PRIESTHOOD 

The Priesthood, being divine, should be honored. It should be 
honored by those who hold it, and it should be honored by those who 
are under the jurisdiction of it. When these men holding this divine 
authority speak, it is the duty of the members of the Church to give 
heed to their words and counsel. We fail in our duty if we do not 
do this thing. Brother John H. Taylor, in his remarks on Friday, stated 
that there were some members of the Church who said: "Why do the 
Authorities of the Church keep admonishing and teaching principles 
to this Church which they know the members will not follow ?" I may 
not be quoting him accurately, but that is the substance of it. I want 
to answer that question. It is the duty of the Authorities of the Church 
to speak by inspiration and revelation. If the membership, or any part 
thereof, should fail to heed the warning or accept the counsel, the in- 
struction which these men in authority give, and especially the one who 
holds the keys of authority, still it is the duty of these men to give 
that instruction, even though they may feel it will not be followed, and 
then the responsibility rests upon the shoulders of those who hear it, 
and if they refuse to receive it the sin is upon their own heads, and they 
will- have to answer for it. 

The Lord said : "Whether it be mine own voice or the voice of 
my servants, it is the same." I read in the preface to this wonderful 
book President Clawson has been telling us about: 

The arm of the Lord shall be revealed, and the day cometh that they 
who will not hear the voice of the Lord, neither the voice of his servants, 
neither give heed to the words of the prophets and apostles, shall be cut 
off from among the people. 

Those members of this Church who criticise and say we hear too 
much of this or that, and thus confess their sins, should take heed and 
repent, for if they refuse to accept the counsels that are given, then the 
responsibility of that disobedience is theirs, and they will have to answer 
for it. 

Short though my memory may be, I can remember not so very far 
back, when the President of this Church gave counsel and advice and 
pleaded with the membership of this Church to do certain things, which 
a large percentage of them refused to do, and I say the Lord is not 
pleased with the inhabitants of Zion. He said that once in the early 
days of the Church. I think we can truthfully repeat it now. 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 1 1 5 



I believe in the Word of Wisdom. I believe in the law of tithing 
and prayer and faith, and the keeping of the Sabbath Day holy, so I 
endorse all that we have heard on these questions during this conference. 

SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES 

One year ago it was my privilege to travel through the Eastern 
States Mission with Elder Don B. Colton, who then presided in that 
field. Our duties took us to the city of Boston, in Massachusetts, and 
in the afternoon we went into an eating house for the purpose of getting 
a meal, shortly before meeting should commence. It was a clean, re- 
spectable place. As we sat down to a table we noticed that upon the 
four sides of every table was the following: "Please do not smoke in 
this room. The majority, including those who smoke, appreciate a 
clean atmosphere in which to enjoy their meals. Thank you for com- 
plying with this request. Pure food and tobacco smoke do not mix." 
It struck me that some of these institutions that cater to the public 
here in Zion might profit by that example. 

I do not go into certain eating places for a mid-day meal, because I 
do not care to sit down at a table, and have some empty-headed girl 
at an adjoining table puff tobacco smoke in my face. That is why I 
am not seen in such places. I think that the semi-respectable places — 
I say semi-respectable, because if tobacco using is permitted in an 
eating house it is only semi-respectable — if they could adopt this notice 
in the eating houses that I speak of, I think it would be an excellent 
thing. This place in Boston was crowded. It did not seem to hurt 
their business. I do not think anybody stayed away because they were 
offended ; the notice was not offensive. Why can it not be adopted here? 

I want to read to you a statement that was made from this very 
stand by the President of the Church at the Conference in October, 
1913. Now, this is a pretty strong statement. He was the mouthpiece 
of God. He spoke by inspiration, and it is good counsel, it seems to 
me, today. He said: 

President George Q. Cannon often said to me and to others that he 
would rather be shut up with a skunk than to be shut up in a smoking 
car with smokers. 

I will pause to say that in the day when this was said they had 
smoking cars. Now all cars, practically, are smoking cars, so are all 
buses and everything else. To continue the quotation : 

What right has a man to befoul with his nauseous breath the air 
that I breathe? What right have I to make noxious the air that you 
breathe. I have no right to do it, and you have a right to protest against 
my doing it, and to show those who are in the habit of doing these things 
your contempt for their practices, if you have any respect for them. You 
should show, at least, your contempt for that which they do foolishly, for 
the practice is wrong, pernicious, and they are unmindful of the rights 
of others. I have thought seriously that a boy or man who has become 
addicted to the use of tobacco in any form, to the extent that he is unable 
to resist his appetite for it, or who has practiced it until he is unable to 



116 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



resist or overcome it, is a man who is so mentally weakened, so morally 
degraded that he is not competent to perform, and would not be worthy 
to be entrusted with any responsible duty. Why? Because a man who 
has become so weak-minded, and irresolute that he cannot overcome the 
temptation to do wrong, or resist the power of an acquired, vicious 
appetite for poison, how can he be trusted ? It is a weakness, a degradation 
that sinks far below the ordinary weakness of mankind, and therefore, 
the person who is so enslaved to vitiated appetites for poisons, hurtful 
things, that he cannot overcome them, being a slave to a pernicious habit, 
a degrading practice, that he cannot rise above it, how dare you trust 
him? How can you entrust to one whose mind is become so weakened, 
so vitiated and so degraded, that he is not his own master, but an 
irresolute slave to unholy passion, any trust that requires honor, strength 
of manhood, determination and will-power to resist evil and temptation 
to do wrong ? You can't do it ! You can't trust a man who has not the 
power of will to say "No" to temptation to do evil, or to that which 
entices to evil. He is only worthy of condemnation, and you cannot safely 
trust him, and you ought not to trust him. 

charles c. Goodwin's editorial 

A few days following the Conference where this was said, Mr. 
Charles C. Goodwin, who for many years was a very bitter opponent 
of the Latter-day Saints, but a very keen editorial writer, and who 
performed that service for many years on a morning paper in this city, 
took up the refrain of President Smith's remarks, and I want to read 
to you what he had to say, because he confessed that he was guilty of the 
habit : 

In a broad and general way I am for the anti-tobacco doctrine 
promulgated by President Joseph F. Smith at the opening of the October 
conference. And I am unprejudiced, because I use the weed. One can 
be pretty patient with the various weaknesses of human nature, but here 
is a habit which God never planted in any human being. It is unnatural 
for a man to chew or smoke tobacco. 

No habit is acquired at such expense of pain and discomfort, or 
against so positive and emphatic an opposition of nature. The man who 
smokes can remember when he began self-administration of nicotine 
poison, and he can remember no other convulsion of his frame which 
equalled that following his first cigar. The deadly sickness, the battle 
of normally clean tissues against the rank enmity of the weed, whether 
smoked or chewed, surpasses any other illness known to man. Sea- 
sickness is a horror, but it is a dream of Paradise and the Peri as 
compared with nicotine poison for the beginner. Ptomaine poison hurts, 
but it is colic compared to convulsions. There is no protest of the 
healthy body possibly approaching the physical warning against tobacco. 
And if the user of tobacco — the confirmed slave today — would supply to 
any useful endeavor the resolution, the persistence, the indifference to 
suffering, the courage, the power of will, the sacrifice of comfort, which 
he has devoted to acquiring the tobacco habit, he would have won — 
though the winning meant fame or fortune, love or leisure! 

President Smith is right. Smoking is foolish. There is not one word 
to be said in sanity to defend it. Chewing tobacco is beyond all expression 
filthy. It is vile, vicious, self-contaminating, offensive to companions, 
and repulsive to the community at large. 

And while neither he nor I will make an end of the custom, it is fair 
to say he told the truth, and it is a thing for patriotic men to applaud, 
because his word in that meeting will save some man from the one habit 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 1 17 



which has nothing to defend it and every consideration of cleanliness 
to oppose. 

Now, there is the statement of a man who has had the unsavory 
experience. 

CLOSING INSTRUCTION 

Brethren, sisters, keep your bodies clean. They are eternal, and the 
Lord expects us to keep them clean if we shall enter into eternal life, 
which is God's life, to be like him. Hearken to the counsels of the 
Priesthood. Keep the commandments of God. Follow the instruction 
President Clawson has given ; read these revelations and make yourselves 
familiar with them, that you may not fail nor be led astray by the teach- 
ings of the world and the philosophies of men. 

So I pray, in the name of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, 
Amen. 

ELDER RULON S. WELLS 

Of the First Council of the Seventy 

In the first chapter of the first book of Moses, which is commonly 
known to us as the Book of Genesis, we will find — what I have always 
considered it to be — an account of the spiritual organization of the 
universe. 

The next chapter, the second, deals with the natural creation after, 
however, first confirming the spiritual creation. It reads like this : 

These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they 
were created, in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens, 

And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb 
of the field before it grew. (Genesis 2:4, 5) 

This narrative is also given to us in the writings of Moses as 
revealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith. In these writings Moses, who 
is also the writer of Genesis which is known as the First Book of Moses, 
gives us a more elaborate account, or I might say a fuller rendition of 
the same narrative. Although the account in Genesis clearly indicates 
both the spiritual and natural creation I will quote the passages from the 
Pearl of Great Price in which the narrative is given even in greater 
clarity and more in detail : 

And now, behold, I say unto you, that these are the generations of the 
heaven and of the earth, when they were created, in the day that I, the 
Lord God, made the heaven and the earth ; 

And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb 
of the field before it grew. For I, the Lord God, created all things, of 
which I have spoken, spiritually, before they were naturally upon the face 
of the earth. For I, the Lord God, had not caused it to rain upon the face 
of the earth. And I, the Lord God, had created all the children of men ; 
and not yet a man to till the ground ; for in heaven created I them ; and 
there was not yet flesh upon the earth, neither in the water, neither in 
the air. (Moses 3:4, 5) 



118 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



My purpose in calling your attention to these paragraphs is to show 
the dual nature of all created things; that we lived in another world 
before this world was made, as the children of God, the spirit children 
of God. 

Let us visualize, if we can, the scenes in heaven in that first estate 
of man, before the world was when the Lord had looked out upon this 
great expanse, and darkness covered the face of the deep; and the Spirit 
of God moved upon the face of the waters, and God said, "Let there 
be light," and there was light, and the universe was ablaze with it. — 
First, the creation spiritual, which of necessity must precede the natural 
creation. 

The second chapter then goes on to relate this remarkable phase 
of our life, the second estate, as the spirit enters into the body. 

And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and 
breathed into his nostrils the breath of life ; and man became a living 
soul. (Gen. 2:7) 

How marvelous that is ! See how many things are explained in these 
scriptures, how many questions are answered! The Lord tells us, in 
one revelation given to Joseph Smith, that "The spirit and the body 
are the soul of man." (D. & C. 88:15) How completely that harmonizes 
with this dual nature of things — The spiritual creation and the natural 
creation ! 

And now let us visualize the Lord standing in the midst of his 
assembled sons and daughters, unfolding to them his almighty purposes 
with regard to the salvation and exaltation of his children, the plan 
covering both their spirit life in heaven and the natural life on earth in 
bodies of flesh and bones ; the two estates of man. 

All this was shown unto Abraham and is recorded in the Book of 
Abraham which was translated by the gift and power of God from 
papyrus by Joseph Smith, the prophet. Let me quote : 

Now the Lord had shown unto me, Abraham, the intelligences that 
were organized before the world was ; and among all these there were 
many of the noble and great ones ; 

And God saw these souls that they were good, and he stood in the 
midst of them, and he said : These I will make my rulers ; for he stood 
among those that were spirits, and he saw that they were good ; and 
he said unto me : Abraham, thou art one of them ; thou wast chosen before 
thou wast born. 

And there stood one among them that was like unto God, and he 
said unto those who were with him: We will go down, for there is space 
there, and we will take of these materials, and we will make an earth 
whereon these may dwell ; 

And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things 
whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them; 

And they who keep their first estate shall be added upon ; and they 
who keep not their first estate shall not have glory in the same kingdom 
with those who keep their first estate ; and they who keep their second 
estate shall have glory added upon their heads for ever and ever. 

And the Lor~d said : Whom shall I send ? And one answered like 
unto the Son of Man : Here am I, send me. And another answered and 
said : Here am I, send me. And the Lord said : I will send the first. 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS 



119 



And the second was angry, and kept not his first estate; and, at that 
day, many followed after him. (Abraham 3:22-28) 

What a flood of light is thrown on the scriptures through this 
marvelous revelation. How many questions are answered. 

The New and Everlasting Covenant was first made in heaven ; and 
afterwards renewed on earth — all through the Bible references are made 
to it. This Covenant is the very essence of God's dealings with his 
children. This also explains why the children of Abraham were called 
God's chosen people. 

Abraham was known unto God as one of the great and noble ones 
for his integrity, and God knew that he would teach his children after 
him; therefore, he was chosen before he was born to become the father 
of the faithful through whom the knowledge of the true and living 
God, even the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, or Israel's God as he is 
variously called, should be maintained upon the earth among the children 
of men; and those who were permitted to come through his lineage 
were among the great and noble ones, or in other words, among those 
who had been valiant in their first Estate. 

Thus it will be seen it was a "natural selection" or we might say 
"a survival of the fittest." It may also be said that through this lineage 
have come the prophets and apostles, the "morning stars" who sang 
together in the primeval days before the world was. Judah held the 
scepter through whom many kings among the nations came, and through 
the tribe of Levi the Aaronic Priesthood during the Mosaic dispensation 
was preserved ; but last and greatest of all through this lineage came 
the "Only Begotten Son of God" in the flesh, but also the son of Mary 
a literal descendant of Abraham. Thus it is seen that through this 
lineage "all of the nations of the earth have been blessed." 

Notwithstanding all this it is still true that God is no respecter of 
persons and all that filled their first Estate are now to pass the second 
trial. 

There will be many of Abraham's seed who, on account of their 
wickedness, will be cast out, and still many others who are not of his 
lineage who by reason of their obedience will be grafted into the Olive 
tree and become known as the children of Abraham— the "chosen 
people of God." 

From these quotations from the Pearl of Great Price we also learn 
that God created this earth expressly for the habitation of his children 
in their mortal bodies which were to be made out of the elements of 
the earth — our mother earth — out of the dust of the ground, and that 
too for our second trial — our second Estate — the span of human life — 
the probationary period. 

But, before placing us here on earth, he first made covenant with 
us that if we kept our first Estate we shall be added upon. In other 
words, there shall be added to our immortal spirits these bodies of flesh 
and bones. And if we keep our second Estate then "glory shall be added 
upon our heads for ever and ever." No wonder then that the sons 
and daughters of God, especially those who were valiant in their first

Estate — the great and the noble — "the morning stars sang together, 
and all the sons of God shouted for joy." (See Job 38:4-7) 

This passage from Job, which even now is a mystery to the world, 
is fully explained by this marvelous revelation from the Book of Abra- 
ham. 

Then the question arose: "Whom shall I send? And one answered 
like unto the Son of Man: Here am I, send me." (Abraham 3:27) 

"Father, thy will be done, and the glory be thine forever." (Moses 

4:2) 

But another one arose and he said : "Behold, here am I, send me, 
I will be thy son, and I will redeem all mankind, that one soul shall not 
be lost, and surely I will do it; wherefore give me thine honor." (Moses 
4:1) 

But God said: 

"I will send the first." (Abraham 4:27) 

And Satan rebelled against God, so there was war in heaven, and 
the war begun in heaven has been continued here on earth. 

And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, 
and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the 
earth, and his angels were cast out with him. (Rev. 12:9) 

The Gospel of Jesus Christ embodies within it "all things whatsoever 
the Lord our God shall command us." If we render obedience to this, 
and remain true to our covenants unto the end, we shall have glory added 
upon our heads for ever and ever. 

May the Lord bless us that we may attain to this exaltation, I pray 
in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

The Choir and congregation sang the hymn, "Come, Come, Ye 
Saints." 

ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them, 
saying, what think ye of Christ? 

As deep answering deep, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints affirms : 

We believe in God, the Eternal Father, and in his Son Jesus Christ, 
and in the Holy Ghost. 

We believe that through the atonement of Christ, all mankind may 
be saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel. 

"the richest hill on earth" 

A few months ago, while visiting the Northwestern States Mission, 
accompanied by its capable mission president, Preston Nibley, I entered 
the city of Butte, Montana. I beheld on a large board this inscription : 
"The Richest Hill on Earth." 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 



121 



Butte derives its name from the old French word "butte" meaning 
a rounded hill. The hill is pierced by a hundred shafts from which has 
been hoisted to the surface $2,500,000,000 of mineral wealth. But 
values are relative. What men call treasures God calls dross. The truth 
still remains : "For the love of money is the root of all evil." 

When I read that inscription, I said to myself, "There is a small 
and solemn hill outside the ancient city of Jerusalem which has yielded 
no mineral treasures, nevertheless it is reverently regarded by true 
Christians as the richest hill on earth." 

For on sacred Calvary took place the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, 
which Canon Farrar declares was "the most stupendous and moving 
scene in the world's history." 

BANISHED FROM GOD'S PRESENCE 

Spiritual ruin came by the fall of man. This is the sad story told 
in the Holy Scriptures: "Because that Adam fell we are; and by his 
fall came death; and we are made partakers of misery and woe. And 
men have become carnal, sensual and devilish, and are shut out from 
the presence of God." 

Man, by sin, brought himself into the captivity of sin. His nature, 
by reason of the fall, became evil continually. He was shut out from 
the presence of the Lord. What a terrible sentence ! Imagination cannot 
conceive a more dreadful judgment. It was not in man's power to escape 
from the misery that never dies. This judgment mortal man could not 
reverse. There was no appellate court. It was to be of endless duration. 
Hope seemed to have bade the world farewell. In despair man stood 
helpless. 

Against this dark background, God, who is love and with whom 
there is forgiveness, caused to shine brightly, the three graces, Faith, 
Hope and Love. He told Adam that Jesus Christ, the righteous Judge, 
would come in the meridian of time and atone for original guilt. 

Down through the ages this living faith and hope sustained those 
who believed in the heavenly promises. The Messiah became the con- 
solation of Israel. "God had turned away his judgments because of his 
Son." 

THE ATONING SACRIFICE 

God himself came down from heaven and made the Divine Sacri- 
fice. The God of Nature suffered and died on the Cross. The Apostle 
Paul said : "We shall be saved by his life, * * * by whom we have now 
received the atonement." (Romans 5:10) 

"The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold 
the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world." (John 1 :29) 

On the Cross our Savior paid the debt that made mankind free. 
He bought us with the price of his precious blood. We are not our 
own for we are bought with a price. His blood atones for all our sins, 
through obedience to righteousness, but it shall not cleanse those who 



122 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



obey not his commandments. The manner of our redemption calls 
forth our love and affection. 

Through the infinite atonement and resurrection of our Lord we 
receive forgiveness of sin, immortality, a glorious resurrection and eternal 
life "which gift is the greatest of all the gifts of God" provided we walk 
before Him, "in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord 
blameless." Death lost its sting, the grave its victory. The Savior's 
death was the door to the glorious resurrection. 

Yes, Calvary is the richest, hill on earth. 

THE INFLUENCE OF THE CHRIST 

A Roman ruler was dying. With relentless cruelty he had sought 
to destroy the sect that was everywhere spoken against, but in vain. 
He had been found fighting against God. Pointing with trembling 
finger in the direction of Calvary he said feebly : "O Nazarene, Nazarene, 
thou hast conquered mightily." 

The sublimity of the Christ is manifested in many men, softening 
the hearts of statesmen and generals. The Savior is a very present help 
in time of need. He pitieth the poor. 

General Lee and General Grant met in Appomattox, near the 
famous apple tree, where General Grant wrote the terms of the sur- 
render of the Confederate Army. He says in his own simple account 
of the event, "The question of the disposition of the Confederates' 
horses arose. I thought they would need them for the spring plowing." 
Then the General magnanimously permitted the Confederates to retain 
their horses. He had a vision. The spirit of Isaiah rested upon him. 
Swords were to be beaten into plow shares. He beheld the battle- 
scarred fields of Dixie blooming in incomparable beauty with corn and 
cotton. I believe that he heard the voice of Jesus saying : "Inasmuch 
as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have 
done it unto me." The great soldier decided to turn into plow horses 
those war horses, which had hauled the Confederates' artillery to points 
where death and devastation could be poured into the Union ranks. 

Oh, that our foreign statesmen, diplomats, and generals could see 
the vision of farms instead of battle fields. Then fields which are now 
running red with human blood would soon bloom with life saving har- 
vests. Someone has said that a sword is a misshaped plow. God hasten 
the day when in this war-torn world there will be more plows than 
swords. 

SPIRITUAL RICHES FROM CUMORAH 

Another hill, old in story, is ancient Cumorah. Out of that hill 
came truth and spiritual riches that will never fade nor perish — a volume 
of Scripture, the Book of Mormon. For many long centuries the people 
whom Columbus found when he stepped on the shores of America had 
no recorded knowledge of their forefathers, or the will of God con- 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 



123 



cerning them. Without scripture which would make them wise unto 
salvation through faith in Jesus Christ they "wandered as strangers in 
sin." The deep darkness of ages had rested like a pall over their buried 
past. But God said, "Let there be light ; and there was light." 
The Prophet Joseph joyfully exclaimed: 

And again, what do we hear. Glad tidings from Cumorah. Moroni, 
an angel from heaven, declaring the fulfillment of the prophets, the book 
to be revealed. 

The Book of Mormon, like the Bible, is holy because it testifies 
that the Savior is the Son of God. The Nephite record contains the 
account of the Messiah's marvelous ministry to his "other sheep" on 
the western hemisphere, after his resurrection and ascension into heaven. 
To be a witness that Jesus is the Christ and to the truth of the Bible, is 
the chief mission of the Book of Mormon which ancient prophets, 
notably Isaiah, predicted would be brought forth to magnify the name of 
God. 

America's destiny foretold 

Behold the destiny of the United States in the light of Book of 
Mormon prophecies : 

The Gentiles shall be blessed upon this land. 
And this land shall be a land of liberty unto the Gentiles. 
There shall be no kings upon the land who shall raise up unto the 
Gentiles. 

For I, the Lord, the king of heaven, will be their king. 
And I will fortify this land against all other nations. 

These glorious predictions shall be fulfilled upon this people upon 
the unchangeable condition that "they will serve the God of the land 
who is Jesus Christ." 

It cannot be said truthfully that Mormonism is intolerant or un- 
patriotic. In the hearts of this people is the essence of true political 
faith, true patriotism for God and country, for which they would shed 
the last drop of their heart's blood. 

Our wonderful Republic. May we revere our heaven inspired 
Constitution and keep it foursquare with the plan of its inspired archi- 
tects, I humbly pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, Amen. 

BISHOP JOHN WELLS 

Second Counselor in the Presiding Bishopric 

I desire to call your attention to an incident in the life of the 
Master. The last day of the Master's life had come. His apostles 
had met with him to commemorate the Passover. The spirit of 
Jesus was troubled, no doubt, because of his impending betrayal and 
sacrifice. After he had designated the traitor and Judas Iscariot 
had left the room, Jesus felt free to speak, as though he had been 



124 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



relieved of a burden. He said in effect : "Now is the Son of Man 
glorified and God is glorified in him. A new commandment I give 
unto you, that ye love one another as I have loved you; that ye also 
love one another. By this shall all men know that ye are my dis- 
ciples, if ye have love one to another." 

To be a true follower or disciple of our Savior we must dem- 
onstrate our love for God, for our Savior and for our fellowmen. 
The Apostle John states : "And this commandment have we from 
him, that he who loveth God loveth his brother also." We can show 
our love one to another by brotherly kindness, neighborliness, serv- 
ice in both spiritual and temporal things, and by the spirit of benevo- 
lence and forgiveness. We manifest our love for one another by our 
righteous precepts and by our good example, that others knowing 
our teachings and feeling the influence of our good example, may 
be induced to follow in paths of rectitude. 

The Prophet Joseph Smith received several revelations from 
the Lord containing this new commandment of the Master. The 
ideal and practical application of this commandment "to love one 
another" is found in the system the Lord revealed to the Saints 
known as the United Order. An epitome of these revelations gives 
the spirit of this economic system : It is not intended, in this heaven- 
sent plan, that one person should possess that which is above an- 
other. Every member of the Church was to have an equal claim for 
his just wants and needs, these claims to be exercised for the benefit 
of the Church as a whole; every member to improve his talents and 
use them for the common good ; every member to seek the interest 
of his neighbor. The purpose of this order was to bring about equal- 
ity in wealth ; there would be no rich, no poor, ample for everyone 
and funds to build up Zion. Under this system there would be no 
waste, no idlers ; industry would be dignified ; all would work for the 
common good. With this equality in temporal things, we find a 
foundation for equality in spiritual things. The word of the Lord 
is "If ye are not equal in earthly things, ye cannot be equal in spirit- 
ual things." The Lord never intended the Latter-day Saints to be 
in bondage to others, nor in the bondage of debt. 

Let us consider our present situation : Ours is a rich nation, the 
richest in the world. However, statements have been made to the 
effect that there is more unemployment and that there are more de- 
pendents on charity in the United States than in all Europe. During 
the past fifty years the number of farmers who own their own farms 
has decreased; the number of mortgaged farms has increased; the 
number who are living on farms has decreased. The conditions in the 
world today of poverty, lack of employment and our competitive 
method of doing business indicate that there is a crying need for a 
re-statement of the commandment of the Master that "ye love one 
another." 

I am thankful for the Church Security Program, which has as 
some of its objectives : to help us "seek the interest of our neigh- 



BISHOP JOHN WELLS

bor ;" to promote the spirit of service and brotherly kindness ; to 
promote equality in temporal things, to care for the poor and needy ; 
to eliminate want and suffering; to find employment for Latter-day 
Saints; to encourage the return to farms; to assist unemployable 
members to do Temple work ; to locate Latter-day Saints on land 
where they may become independent ; to encourage quorums of 
the Priesthood to develop useful quorum projects; to stimulate the 
beautification of homes and places of worship ; to have canning and 
sewing centers; to take care of surplus food, or in other words to 
develop brotherhood and cooperation. This plan has been in- 
augurated by the First Presidency of the Church. Its efficacy and 
purpose can never be doubted. It is for our benefit and our blessing. 

George Holyoake, the author of books on Consumers' Coopera- 
tion, made a statement which I think can be applied to our Church 
Security Plan. He said : 

Cooperation touches no man's fortune, seeks no plunder, causes no dis- 
turbance in society, gives no trouble to statesmen, enters into no secret 
associations, contemplates no violence, subverts no order, envies no dignity, 
asks no favor, keeps no terms with the idle, and will break no faith with 
the industrious. 

I want to express my appreciation for what has been done un- 
der this security program of the Church. As I see it, it is the be- 
ginning of higher and nobler things. The Lord intends his people 
to be equal in all things, both temporal and spiritual. 

My brethren and sisters, let us get back to simple methods of 
living — of helpfulness, each Latter-day Saint doing his share in the 
community, cooperating in all useful efforts and for the good of all. 
We are ideally situated to carry forward cooperation in temporal 
affairs, for we are accustomed to cooperating in spiritual matters. 
I sincerely hope we will give study, thought and consideration to 
"seeking the interest of our neighbor and doing all things with an 
eye single to the glory of God." Remember always the words of the 
Master, "By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye 
have love one to another." May we apply the spirit and meaning 
of this commandment in our daily lives. 

My heart is filled with thanksgiving for the Gospel and for the 
privileges and blessings I enjoy. I appreciate my membership in 
the Church and the opportunity which is mine to labor in the min- 
istry, to give service in the Church. I know that God lives, that 
Jesus is the Christ, that Joseph Smith is a Prophet of the Living 
God, and that through his instrumentality this great latter-day work 
has been established. It will continue to increase, gathering power 
and influence as it grows in years and numbers! 

May we follow the counsel and admonitions given to us in these 
latter-days for our spiritual and temporal welfare, I pray, in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



BISHOP DAVID A. SMITH 

First Counselor in the Presiding Bishopric 

I rejoice this day, my brethren and sisters, in my lot. I am 
happy to have the privilege of laboring with these, our brethren, 
whom we sustain as the Authorities of the Church. 

I am grateful to my Heavenly Father for permitting me to hold 
the holy Priesthood, the power of which I have seen manifest in un- 
mistakable manner. I am grateful for the privilege that comes to 
me of visiting with you in your homes, in your wards, in your stakes, 
where I receive blessings and encouragement. 

I want to say to my brethren who feel to criticise the President 
of this Church for repeatedly calling your attention to your failure 
to keep the commandments which God has given, especially you 
who have had the Priesthood conferred upon you — when you feel 
this desire coming upon you, think what you would do under the 
conditions we face in this day, were you in the position of the Presi- 
dent of this Church, and felt the responsibility as he feels it. Then 
perhaps you would change your mind and your attitude. I have no 
word of censure for you, only pity, and in a spirit of love I call upon 
you to repent, for you are walking in the shadow of darkness and 
in danger of becoming lost, for so the Lord hath spoken. 

To me it seems that there has been no time in the history of 
the Church when it was more necessary that we should arm, not with 
the implements of modern warfare — and may I say the cruel im- 
plements of modern warfare — which are a menace to the world in 
this day, but with the authority of the holy Priesthood, clothed with 
the power of the Holy Ghost, which is promised to us as a guide, 
and which will, through our faithfulness, lead us into the path of 
light and truth and righteousness and on to eternal life and ex- 
altation. 

It is a great privilege to go into the world to preach the Gospel. 
It is a greater privilege to preach it in our home, in the home of our 
neighbor, our friend, our kindred. This is our mission. This is our 
work, as the army of the living God, clothed with his power and 
authority. Are we using it to the fullest? Are we neglecting it? 
Do we appreciate it? 

I constantly pray that I shall not be found at any time be- 
littling this great work which has been entrusted to our care, or 
making light of those who I know are heart and soul in this great 
work, full of faith and knowledge and honesty of purpose. 

I thank my God for his blessings, for his plan of salvation, his 
Gospel message, and that I find in my soul harmony therewith. May 
his blessings be upon us. May we, in the power which he intends 
that we shall have, go forward to accomplish his purposes, that his 
blessings shall rest upon us in abundance, I pray, in the name of 
Jesus Christ. Amen.

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I am very pleased indeed to express my deep appreciation of our 
Conference, from start to finish. 

I am grateful for the Gospel of Jesus Christ. I am thankful for 
the devotion of the Latter-day Saints as a whole. 

CONSCIENTIOUS OBSERVANCE OF LAWS REQUIRED 

I announced here at the Priesthood meeting last night and I decided 
to announce it again that we expect all the General Officers of the Church, 
each and every one of them, from this very day, to be absolute, full 
tithepayers, to really and truly observe the Word of Wisdom ; and we ask 
all of the officers of the Church and all members of the General Boards, 
and all Stake and Ward officers, if they are not living the Gospel and 
honestly and conscientiously paying their tithing, to kindly step aside, 
unless from this day they live up to these provisions. 

We have undertaken a most stupendous work and there will be 
no difficulty whatever in carrying out that great work. We will have an 
abundance to take care of every living Latter-day Saint who is in distress. 
Mind you, when I say Latter-day Saint I mean Latter-day Saint. I 
am not talking about idlers. I am not talking about people that want to 
lie down and let somebody else take care of them — I am talking of 
Latter-day Saints. If the people will pay their tithing and if they will 
keep the Word of Wisdom, and will actually, really, and for a fact, fast 
two meals once a month and give the equivalent, we will be able to carry 
forward our Security Plan without any trouble whatever. 

It is simply marvelous that people can live on eleven cents, some 
of them — two meals a day once each month for twelve months in the 



130 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



year — twenty-four meals on a half a cent a meal. (Or at least, so their 
fast offerings would indicate.) 

We feel that in all the stakes of Zion, every stake president, every 
counselor to a stake president, every stake clerk, and every high councilor, 
standing at the head of the people in the stake — we ask them to kindly 
step aside unless they are living up to these laws. They are given the 
responsibility of presiding, and every officer who is a presiding officer 
should say from today: "I am going to serve the Lord, so that my 
example will be worthy of imitation." 

No man can teach the Word of Wisdom by the Spirit of God who 
does not live it. No man can proclaim this Gospel by the Spirit of the 
Living God unless that man is living his religion ; and with this great 
undertaking that we have before us now we must renew our loyalty 
to God, and I believe beyond a shadow of doubt that God inspires and 
blesses, and multiplies our substance when we are honest with him. 
We do not want in this day a repetition of what the scriptures tell us 
was the condition in years gone by, wherein the Lord declares that he 
had been robbed, because of the failure of the people to live the financial 
law that God has revealed. 

Now, I pray from the bottom of my heart that God will give each 
and every man and woman who holds an office in any stake or ward the 
spirit and the feeling and the determination from this day, to renew 
his covenants with God, to live his religion; and if we are too weak 
to do these things, we should step aside and let somebody else take our 
place. 

THE MIND AND THE WILL OF THE LORD 

The Word of Wisdom, we are told, is such that it can be kept by 
"the weak and the weakest of all Saints." 1 have heard that some of the 
members of Boards, after the law was passed legalizing beer, said : "Well, 
I do declare, now I am entitled to have a glass of beer." No Latter-day 
Saint is entitled to anything that is contrary to the mind and the will 
of the Lord, and the Word of Wisdom is the mind and the will of the 
Lord. 

I want you to know that this will make no difference to me personally, 
but as the shepherd of the flock, the day has come, in my judgment and 
in the judgment of my associates, that we must live up to and be loyal 
to this work and serve God with all our heart, might, mind, and strength, 
if we are to accomplish what the Lord wants us to do. 

BLESSINGS INVOKED 

I thank you all for your presence here. 1 thank the Lord for the 
splendid Conference we have had. In so far as God has given me the 
power to do so I pray God to bless you one and all. I pray God to bless 
all the Latter-day Saints. I pray God to bless every soul that has good 
intentions, and to strengthen him and her in their determination to keep 
the commandments of the Lord. I love the Lord ; I love the Latter-day 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



131 



Saints ; I love the honest the world over ; I have no animosity against any 
living soul. The Gospel of Jesus Christ is one of forgiveness of wrong- 
doing. It is a part of the Gospel to forgive those who have done wrong, 
when they repent, but "By this ye. may know if a man repenteth of his 
sins — behold, he will confess them and forsake them." He will do them 
no more. 

The time has expired. 

May God's blessings be with each and all of you, and with all the 
Saints, and with all the honest the world over, I pray in the name of 
Jesus Christ, our Redeemer, Amen. 

The Choir sang the "Hallelujah Chorus" (Handel). 
Elder Paul C. Child, President of the Pioneer Stake, offered the 
benediction. 

Conference adjourned for six months. 



The singing at the two Friday sessions of the Conference, by the 
Relief Society Singing M others, was under the direction of Sister Char- 
lotte O. Sackett ; Elder Carl Nelson directed the singing of the Nebo 
Stake Choir at the Saturday morning and afternoon sessions ; J. Spencer 
Cornwall led the congregational singing at all the sessions and conducted 
the singing of the Tabernacle Choir on Sunday. 

Accompaniments and interludes on the great organ were played 
by Frank W. Asper. 

Stenographic notes of the Conference were taken by Frank W. 
Otterstrom and Joseph Anderson.

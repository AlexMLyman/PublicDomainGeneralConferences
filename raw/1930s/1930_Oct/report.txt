CA c t5hvillin& Story of 

CENTURY ONE OF 
CHURCH HISTORY 

mERE is a new story of "Mormonism," told with a com- 
pleteness and charm that will thrill Latter-day Saints 
with a pride of achievement and at the same time win 
the admiration of the critic, be he friend or foe. In a COM- 
PREHENSIVE HISTORY OF THE CHURCH, B. H. Roberts 
has done a masterful piece of research and has set down the 
record of Century One — 1830 to 1930 — in a brilliant appraisal of 
momentous events. The reader with a sentimental interest will 
be fascinated with this narrative of truth stranger than fiction; 
the reader who approaches the new work with the critical vision 
of the historian will find it fair in statement, authentic in fact, 
copious in detail and sound in judgment. 

A COMPREHENSIVE HISTORY OF THE CHURCH was writ- 
ten by Elder Roberts at the instance of the First Presidency of 
the Church, with a commission to make it exhaustively complete, 
from the remotest beginnings to the close of the Centennial 
Conference of April 6, 1930. The final volume ends with an 
account of the Conference itself, making the history technically 
inclusive of all that happened in Century One of the organized 
existence of the Church. Thus it is a fitting commemoration of 
one hundred years of struggle and achievement. 
This monumental work is not to be confused with any former 
history, journal or chronicle. Though its nucleus is the history 
of "Mormonism" published a few years ago in AMERICANA, 
running serially for six years through that magazine, yet this 
History is NEW — new in its wealth of material, new in method 
of treatment and new in its physical representation of the book 
maker's art.

FIRST DAY 
MORNING MEETING 

The opening session of the Conference commenced promptly at 
10 o'clock, Friday, October 3, 1930. 

The great auditorium and galleries were well filled with people from 
all parts of the Church. 

President Heber J. Grant called the assembly to order, and the 
services were commenced by the congregation singing the hymn, 
"Now let us Rejoice in the Day of Salvation." 

Elder Claudius Hirschi, President of the Zion Park Stake, offered 
the invocation. 

The congregation sang the hymn, "Zion Stands with Hills Sur- 
rounded." 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

It is always a pleasure to me to meet with the Latter-day Saints 
in any of their public gatherings, and especially am I pleased to be 
present at the General Conferences of the Church, having had the 
privilege of attending them from my childhood until the present time. 

There are assembled I am sure in this city today fully twenty 
thousand people from different sections of the Church, from Canada on 
the north to Mexico on the south, who will attend these meetings. 
In addition there will be several hundred thousand who will attend our 
meetings by means of the marvelous radio. It is wonderful how many 
people are permitted to listen in, those who have a desire to do so, to 
our conference proceedings. In many of our Wards and Stakes the 
meetinghouses will be filled with those who will hear as plainly and 
partake of the spirit I believe as perfectly almost as those who are 
assembled in this building today. 

I rejoice in the opportunities that have come to preach the Gospel 
through the means of the radio. One day four letters were received 
from New Zealand, announcing the perfect reception of a program 
broadcast by KSL. 

CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION PUBLICITY 

We rejoice in the marvelous Conference that was held here six 
months ago. When we think of this building being filled for thirty 
evenings by people who attended the wonderful pageant that was 
presented, it is another marvel to contemplate the fact that publicity 
was given to millions of people regarding that great pageant. I have 
here on exhibit and I wish to show you what is merely a collection of 
newspaper clippings regarding our Centennial celebration. Over three 



'PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT

thousand newspapers gave us favorable notices. The great change 
that has come about since the days of my boyhood in the general 
attitude toward this people is almost beyond contemplation or ex- 
pectation. 

I can remember when I was the junior member of the Council 
of the Twelve, forty-eight years ago this month, that during my first 
trips away from home, almost invariably, wherever I went I found 
opposition. I found ill-will toward the Latter-day Saints. I found 
men so full of bitterness toward us that they said if they had their way 
the "Mormons" would be shut up in their tabernacle and the guns of 
Fort Douglas be turned upon them. Today, wherever I go I find the 
opposite feeling; I find good-will; I find kindness; I find readiness 
and willingness on the part of newspapers to give us favorable public 
notices. Anything we wish to say they are willing to print. 

ATTITUDE OF THE PRESS 

During the time when I presided over the Japanese Mission there 
were some vile things published in that country about us; and when 
I obtained affidavits from home refuting the published statements 
I could not get them into the papers that had published the scurrilous 
articles against us. During my presidency of the European Mission, 
for three long years, I never succeeded in getting one single line of 
refutation printed in the papers in England. Some very pernicious 
articles were written about us, but the newspapers would not publish 
refutations of those articles. Today, we are getting very favorable 
publicity. The newspapers are open to the president of the European 
Mission, Elder John A. Widtsoe. We regret his absence from the 
meetings of this Conference. We would be delighted if he were here. 

We also regret very much the absence of Elder Stephen L. 
Richards on account of ill health. 

I remember calling upon one newspaper in London that had pub- 
lished some seven to ten columns of vile stuff about the "Mormons," 
and I took with me a letter of introduction from a large shipping 
firm in Liverpool — with which we had done business for over sixty 
years — ■ vouching not only for my integrity as president of the European 
Mission, but for the integrity of all of my predecessors, and yet they 
would not publish a single line. I told them I had letters of introduction 
from all of the non-"Mormon" bankers in Salt Lake City, and from 
bankers in New York, San Francisco, and Chicago, and from the 
largest wholesale dry goods house in New York, vouching for my 
honesty, and gave them my word of honor that what they had published 
was false. Yet they would not publish a thing in our favor. 

SOURCE OF GRATITUDE 

To have over three thousand newspapers ; to have the Associated 
Press; to have the Hearst papers, and to have western papers — 
especially in Utah and in Idaho — the newspapers generally, give 
us such extended and favorable articles as this immense volume

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



contains, is a cause of deep gratitude on my part and that of my 
associates of the General Authorities of the Church. These no- 
tices and editorials as well as the original articles that appeared 
with illustrations, are all that we could possibly have asked. "There was 
very seldom anything published during our Centennial Conference 
that was not favorable. The Associated Press and special representa- 
tives of various newspapers sent out truthful and informative notices. 
This is a source of profound gratitude on our part. 

FOR WHAT WE ARE 

I announced to the good sisters yesterday in their Relief Society 
Conference that we are becoming known for what we are, a God- 
fearing, honest, upright people, striving to serve the Lord and keep 
his commandments, carrying a message of good will to all the world. 
All that we have ever asked or expected is that people shall judge 
us by the standards laid down by the Savior of the world, "By their 
fruits ye shall know them." 

We have a lower divorce rate, we have a higher marriage rate, 
we have a higher birth rate, we have a lower death rate, we have 
a lower criminal rate, than other people. 

I know of nothing for which I am more grateful than to realize 
that we are coming into our own, that we are being accepted for exactly 
what we are, a God-fearing and splendid people. 

IN FULFILMENT OF PROPHECY 

The accomplishments of the Latter-day Saints are in absolute 
and full accord with the prophecy delivered on the west bank of the 
Mississippi river by the Prophet Joseph Smith, as recorded in the 
prophet's journal under date of August 6, 1842 : 

"I prophesied that the Saints would continue to suffer much affliction 
and would be driven to the Rocky Mountains. Many would apostatize, others 
would be put to death by our persecutors or lose their lives in consequence 
of exposure or disease, and some of you will live to go and assist in making 
settlements and build cities, and see the Saints become a mighty people in the 
midst of the Rocky Mountains." 

This has been fulfilled to the very letter and we have over one 
thousand wards and branches from Canada on the north to Mexico on 
the south. The Church has expended during the last three years be- 
tween three and four million dollars in assisting to erect local meeting- 
houses. The people have contributed a like amount. As you know 
we have builded here a four-million-dollar temple, and we have built 
temples in St. George, Manti, Logan, Canada, Arizona and the Hawaiian 
Islands, costing in all many millions of money. We have in very deed 
fulfilled that prophecy notwithstanding the fact that this western country 
was considered worthless. When you think of this arid region, when 
you think that it was considered of no value, and then realize what 
has been accomplished, it is beyond question that we have fulfilled that 
prediction. 



[PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



5 



At the very time this prophecy was uttered, Daniel Webster, one 
of the foremost statesmen in the United States at that time, said: 

"What do we want with this vast worthless area, this region of savages 
and wild beasts, of deserts, of shifting sands, and whirlwinds of dust, of cactus 
and prairie dogs? To what use could we ever hope to put those great deserts 
or those endless mountain ranges, impenetrable and covered to their very bases 
with eternal snow? What can we ever hope to do with the western coast of 
three thousand miles, rock-bound, cheerless, uninviting and not a harbor on it? 
Mr. President, T will never vote one cent from the public treasury to place the 
Pacific Coast one inch nearer Boston than it now is." 

MARVELOUS RESOURCES 

When I think of the magnificent harbor at Seattle, and the wonder- 
ful Golden Gate harbor as well as others on the Pacific Coast, I am 
aware that Daniel Webster was not very well posted. When we think 
of this "worthless" country — Utah, Idaho, Arizona, Colorado, New 
Mexico and California — having furnished more wealth so far as the 
precious metals are concerned than any other part or all of the balance, 
I think, of the United States ; when we realize that we have one mine 
here, a copper mine, the copper being mined in a most unusual and 
wonderful way, having paid as I recall over one hundred and fifty 
million dollars in dividends, working successfully ore that does not run 
one per cent — less than twenty pounds of copper to a ton — handling 
upon one occasion more than eighty thousand tons in a day, or double 
as much as was handled in a day in the construction of the Panama 
canal ; when we think of the millions upon millions of dollars' worth 
of gold produced in California; when we think of the rich copper 
mines in Arizona, to say nothing of silver, lead and gold in all these 
sections, and Colorado's immense wealth, we realize that Daniel Webster 
did not know very much about this country. 

But the only point I wish to make is that we as Latter-day Saints 
realize and know that Joseph Smith was and is the representative of 
God and a prophet of God, and that his sayings have been fulfilled 
to the very letter. 

SIGNS OF THE TIMES 

I am very happy in contemplating the prosperity that prevails 
today, and my heart goes out in gratitude for the change that has taken 
place at home and abroad. While the world is in a state of commotion 
and there is perplexity among the nations, the Latter-day Saints have 
no fears for the future. The signs of the times indicate the near 
approach of the coming of the Lord, and the work that we are engaged 
in is a preparatory one for that great event. 

NEVER WHILE THE WORLD STANDS 

In speaking here last month, Bishop Sylvester Q. Cannon referred 
to a statement made by a minister to the effect that unless the "Mormon" 
Church can withstand the criticism of intelligent people, the test of 
modern science, etc., it must, in the next one hundred years, be counted

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



in the category of declining religions and that it would then be necessary 
for us to shift our faith from Joseph Smith and his reputed revelations. 

Never while the world stands will it be necessary for us to shift 
our faith. God lives, Jesus Christ is the Son of the living God. He 
has appeared to Joseph Smith, Oliver Cowdery, and Sidney Rigdon, and 
we proclaim to all the world that we know that he lives and that God 
has given to us individually a testimony regarding the divinity of the 
mission of Joseph Smith. We have the truth, and as the great lawyer 
said to those who were fighting Christianity, we can repeat today : 

"Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a doctor 
of the law, had in reputation among all the people, and commanded to put the 
apostles forth a little space; 

"And said unto them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what ye 
intend to do as touching these men. * * * 

"Refrain from these men, and let them alone ; for if this work be of men, 
it will come to naught: 

' But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it ; lest haply ye be found to fight 
against God." 

DURING ONE HUNDRED YEARS 

This work is of God and it has been proclaimed now for over a 
hundred years. We are here today assembled celebrating the one hun- 
dred and first semi-annual Conference of the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints. During all of these one hundred years the Gospel 
of Jesus Christ, as revealed through the instrumentality of the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, has been proclaimed all over the world wherever there 
has been religious liberty. In every land and in every clime wherever 
it has been proclaimed honest men and honest women have received 
the message, have accepted the Gospel, have gone down into the 
waters of baptism, have pledged their lives and their fortunes for 
the advancement of this work. From every religious denomination 
under heaven we have gathered converts. I have never investigated 
beyond my own experience in life, but I know of no single missionary 
who has gone out into the world, not one, who has been converted to 
any other religion and come home to announce that this Gospel of 
Jesus Christ is not true. But by the hundreds and thousands, during 
my life, I have heard the testimonies of the young men and the young 
women who have gone out to proclaim this Gospel returning from their 
missionary work and bearing witness that they had an increased knowl- 
edge of the divinity of this work, that their testimonies had been 
strengthened. Think of it! What a wonderful miracle it is that with 
this "false" prophet and these "purported" revelations our young in- 
experienced members of the Church go out and come in contact with 
all the education, all the learning, and all the faiths of the world, and 
yet the churches have not been able to convert any of them and show 
them that straight and narrow path that leads to life eternal. 

WITNESS TO THE WORLD 

I bear my witness to you today — and I am talking now not only 
to the people who are here assembled but to the people who may be 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT

listening in by means of the radio, at home or abroad, in the United 
States or in foreign countries — I bear my witness that God lives, that 
he is the Father of our spirits; that Jesus Christ is the Son of the 
living God ; that Joseph Smith is a prophet of the true and the living 
God, and that his words contained in the Doctrine and Covenants are 
the inspired words of a prophet of God. I desire all men to know 
that the revelation or vision given to Joseph Smith, as contained in the 
seventy-sixth section of the Doctrine and Covenants is absolutely true. 
I have repeated two passages from that section time and time again, 
and I shall repeat them again now, in this day of doubt. 

Some years ago many ministers of the gospel, even several hundred 
of them, were asked the following questions : 

"Do you believe in God, the Father ; God a person * * * in whose image you 
were made? 

"Do you believe that Christ was the Son of the living God, sent by him 
to save the world * * * that he is God's very Son, with a divinely appointed 
and definite mission, dying on the cross and raised from the dead? 

"Do you believe that when you die you will live again as a conscious 
intelligence, knowing who you are and who other people are?" 

These questions were put to ministers in the New England States, 
and not a single one gave an unequivocal answer, Yes, notwithstanding 
they had been asked to answer them Yes or No. 

THE FAITH OF THE LATTER-DAY SAINTS 

All three of those questions can be answered by every Latter- 
day Saint. We believe that God appeared to Joseph Smith, and that 
he proclaimed Jesus Christ as his "Well Beloved Son." 

And now, I quote from the vision given to Joseph Smith and 
Sidney Rigdon : 

"And this is the gospel, the glad tidings, which the voice out of the 
heavens bore record unto us : 

"That he came into the world, even Jesus, to be crucified for the world, and 
to bear the sins of the world, and to sanctify the world, and to cleanse it from 
all unrighteousness. 

"Who glorifies the Father, and saves all the works of his hands, except 
those sons of perdition who deny the Son after the Father has revealed him." 

"And now, after the many testimonies that have been given of him, this is 
the testimony, last of all, which we give of him : that he lives ! 

"''For we saw him, even on the right hand of God ; and we heard the voice 
declaring that he is the Only Begotten of the Father— 

"That by him, and through him, and of him, the worlds were created, and 
the inhabitants thereof are begotten sons and daughters unto God." 

So there is no dubiety in our minds. One man said to me, "The 
only religious people I ever met in my life who have a perfect faith 
in and an absolute assurance of their final destiny are the Mormons." 
And it is true. 

IN DEEP GRATITUDE 

I feel that I have occupied enough time. I rejoice in the advance- 
ment of the work of God. My heart goes out in deep gratitude to the

GENERAL ■ CONFERENCE 



members of the committee who furnished that magnificent pageant. 
I thank the men who secured this wonderful publicity for us. It is 
marvelous. 

May the Lord bless each and every one who has a testimony of 
the divinity of this work to so live the Gospel that his life will pro- 
claim its message to the people of the world. The promise is made 
that those who will do the will of the Father shall know of the doctrine 
whether it be of God or whether it be of man. Having fulfilled the 
law and having received the knowledge that we are engaged in the work 
of the Lord, we pray that he may help us to live it. May he help us to 
be absolutely honest in the payment of our tithes, in observing the 
Word of Wisdom and setting an example that will cause men and 
women to investigate the message that we have to bear. It is my 
humble prayer that the Lord will bless every honest-hearted soul upon 
the face of the earth, and I ask it in the name of Jesus, our Redeemer. 
Amen. 

ELDER DAVID O. McKAY 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

It is a source of deep satisfaction to have the privilege of meeting 
the officers of Stakes and Wards and members of the Church in general 
in this great Conference. I am greatly surprised, however, to be 
called upon to address you at this session. I pray earnestly for the 
inspiration and guidance of God's Holy Spirit and for your sympathy 
and prayers. 

I am not sure that I can give to you in the brief time allotted, in 
a manner that I should like to give it, the message that I have in 
my heart. 

THE CITIZEN'S RESPONSIBILITY 

Many many years ago a wise man said, and it has echoed through 
the ages : 

"Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not 
depart from it." 

I wish to add as a corollary: 

"Punish a man when he is old, and he will not likely depart from the habits 
of a lifetime." 

I am constrained to refer to the great concern in the minds of the 
leaders of our nation and of thinking men generally regarding the law- 
less condition now prevalent, particularly here in the United States. 
Recently a committee of the American Bar Association appointed to 
study existing conditions, reported that the criminal situation in the 
United States is undoubtedly worse than in any other civilized country. 
I think it is time that the people arouse themselves to a realization of 
their responsibility in regard to this condition. We are prone to dismiss 
all social responsibility by blaming the law and depending upon the 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY 



9 



lawyers to bring about a reform. But I think the citizen carries much 
of the responsibility for this condition. 

PREVENTION RATHER THAN CURE 

If we look at the statistics as they are published from time to time 
we are shocked to learn that our prisons are filled. We are astounded 
when we read of the vast sums of money expended in punishing lawless 
men and women and wayward boys and girls, who are considered 
enemies to society. It is difficult to ascertain definitely how much this 
sum is, about two and one half million dollars a day. One man 
estimates that we are spending ten billion dollars a year in the punish- 
ment of criminals ; yet each year crime is eating deeper into the vitals 
of our civilization. 

I suggest that we expend some of that vast sum of money to better 
advantage by putting forth more effort to stop the source of crime by 
giving a little more attention to the young. For, mind you, the average 
age of the criminal in the United States today is under twenty one years. 
That is something which challenges our attention. Wie are not spend- 
ing proportionately the amount in preventing lawlessness among our 
youth that we are spending in punishing those who become entangled 
in the meshes of the law. Men and women who are thus arrested and 
punished are not all bad. Some are misled, others are merely un- 
fortunate. 

THE POWER AND INFLUENCE OF MONEY 

To understand more clearly conditions as they exist, I think it is 
well to consider the dominant influences of society today. If we go 
back through history we find that at one time the world was governed 
by the spirit of might, physical force was the aristocracy of the age. 
And naturally men chose to be strong in physical achievements. Later 
that period gave way to another aristocracy, or ruling power. The 
sons of these mighty physical men became the rulers, and so there 
developed an aristocracy of birth. 

You and I are witnessing and have witnessed the decay of this 
aristocracy. Thrones are crumbling, their power is diminished. Titles 
can be purchased by money. Supplanting the aristocracy of birth has 
come the aristocracy of wealth. Money, it is said, can buy anything. 
Unquestionably one of the great factors that enter into the lawlessness 
following efforts to prohibit the sale and manufacture of liquor, is the 
great amount of profit that men find in that illicit traffic. If we can 
prevent the bootlegger from filling his purse we can better enforce 
the law against this liquor evil. And in passing let me urge every 
Latter-day Saint throughout the world to uphold the law against the 
sale, manufacture and transportation of intoxicants. 

Well, we are in this financial age. We need to realize this when we 
examine and study the conditions that are influencing the youth of 
today. Many of them are seeking to be wealthy. They are thinking 
that success lies only in the obtaining of the dollar, and with that 



10 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



unwise ideal they will sacrifice that which is higher and better than 
any material possession. 

Do not misunderstand me, ,1 would not underrate the value of 
wealth. I am cognizant of the fact that the second great command- 
ment was to replenish and subdue the earth. I realize that one great 
purpose of life is to subdue matter, and I rejoice when I see the great 
reservoirs filled with water from which flows that element which will 
change the sagebrush flat into a waving wheat field, and that is wealth. 
I do not take second place to anyone in the realization of the good 
which this can do. I am merely emphasizing the thought that there is 
a nobler ideal in life than the accumulating of wealth. 

THE ARISTOCRACY OF CHARACTER 

When God gave us the command to subdue matter, he meant 
us to use the power derived therefrom, the power of material things, to 
realize something which is higher ; and that is character, a life that will 
merit the inspiration of God. What the sunshine is to the field and 
to the flowers the Holy Spirit is to the life of man, and the Holy 
Spirit does not abide with base characters. He will not dwell in unclean 
tabernacles. 

Well, now, my thought is that we should put forth every effort 
to supplant the aristocracy of wealth with the aristocracy of character, 
and awaken in the minds of the youth a realization that to be honest, 
to be dependable, to be a loyal citizen of the country, to be true to 
the standards of the Gospel, are the noblest ideals of life. The im- 
portant problem is now to instill these lofty principles into the minds 
of young people, and thereby make them worthy citizens. I am glad 
to see evidences in our own country that men are now moving towards 
the beginning of the stream of humanity to correct evils, rather than 
to expend so much money on those who have drifted down the stream 
of society and have become contaminated by sin and hardened in law- 
lessness. 

CHILD GUIDANCE 

On Christmas day, 1908, President Roosevelt invited 200 child 
welfare workers in all parts of the United States to attend a conference 
on dependent children, to be held in Washington, Jan. 25, 26, 1909. 
Much good came from that. Later President Wilson, referring to the 
Children's Bureau of the United States Department of Labor, expressed 
the hope that there might be set up "certain irreducible minimum 
standards for the health, education, and work of the American child." 
Recently President Hoover said that the opportunity of the nation lies 
in the health and protection of its children, and in accordance with 
that thought he has appointed an investigating committee charged with 
the duty of getting at the facts of the physical health, mental equipment, 
and social well-being of children in the United States. Many of the 
leading men of the nation, educators, business men, doctors, etc., are 
volunteering their services to a nationwide investigation of conditions, 
with a view of ascertaining what forces are operative in child guidance.

DURING LEISURE HOURS 

I cannot refrain from calling your attention to what Utah is 
doing in regard to this important question. Let me say that I am not 
now thinking so much of the child when he is in the home under the 
influence of parents, neither am I concerned so much about him when 
he is in the public school under the influence of the teacher, although 
in both these basic environments much more emphasis might be placed 
upon character and loyal citizenship than we are placing upon it ; I am 
concerned about the child when he is not in school, about what he is 
doing after school. In other words, it is time for the nation and for 
states to look after the youth during leisure hours. The leisure time 
of youth is the dangerous time. That is when he needs the training, 
and yet in some of our states we have compulsory education up to 
fourteen years of age, and in those same states have laws prohibiting 
the boy from working until he is sixteen. There you find a two years' 
period in which the boy is left practically to go his way. And what 
is his way? He will find the gang, and gangs are often the breeding 
grounds of bootleggers and organized vice squads. 

In Chicago alone it is said there are thirteen hundred and thirty 
gangs, young boys who are going their own way, and whose efforts 
should be guided, no matter what it costs, along the paths of better 
citizenship. In Utah we have a law that compels the young man and the 
young woman to be in school until he or she is eighteen years of age. 
However, it is one thing to force a boy into school, it is another thing 
to arouse in his life an ideal, or a desire to emulate the best in life. 

AN EXAMPLE WORTHY OF IMITATION 

In one of our school districts great strides have been taken in 
guiding and taking care of the leisure hours of youth, particularly 
during summer vacations, not only in recreation but in vocation. A 
few years ago the Granite School District inaugurated a plan of 
guiding these students in the proper way of citizenship. Brother 
Francis Kirkham, who is now a member of the national committee 
to which I have referred, was instrumental in introducing this, and 
Superintendent D. C. Jensen is carrying the work nobly forward. I 
am mentioning it now because it is an example worthy of imitation by 
all educators in the state and nation. Summer supervision for Junior 
and Senior high school students was inaugurated in 1920, when 1227 
students were enrolled. In the summer of 1921, the enrollment in- 
creased to 1500. In 1930 in two important respects the policy in this 
district was changed in respect to compulsory enrollment. "School 
officials do not now require enrollment in the activities of the summer, 
nor do they make a formal record of the credits earned as a requisite 
to unconditional promotion. Enrollment is wholly voluntary and the 
joy obtained through participation is the only reward offered." Not- 
withstanding they give no credits, make no compulsion, last year there 
were enrolled 4303 in activities as follows :

In addition to those instructed by music teachers employed by the Board, 
102 students were in regular classes under teachers employed by local municipal 
or civic organizations. 

It cost the children nothing, it cost the parents nothing. The 
Jordan District carried this on at an expense that is merely nominal, 
only $1.33 per pupil. 

But the teachers did not stop at instruction and play during the 
recreation period; they found also lucrative employment for the 
students. The total number of students thus placed and properly 
supervised in picking beans, thinning beets, delivering groceries and 
in other jobs, was 476. The number of boys contacted 111. Total 
number of employers cooperating 103. Total number of visits for 
all purposes 670. 

ITS EFFECT UPON CITIZENSHIP 

Now to show what effect this will have upon citizenship. During 
the school year there was a family in that district that refused to send 
the boys to school. The truant officer visited it and found antagonism 
on the part of the parents. The boys were not interested in school. 
Later the father was out of work and when the truant officer went 
there he threatened the officer by saying, "If you take me to court 
there will be a serious tragedy in this end of the county. If you 
want to keep healthy, leave me alone." But the boys were compelled to 
go to school. ! The father however had to be arrested and the law 
was enforced. 

During the summer vacation this same officer visited that home 
with the view of offering employment to the boys. When the father 
met him at the door, despondent, still bitter and defiant of the law, 
he said, ''Well, what do you want now?" 

"Have you any employment?" 

"No." 

"Would your boys like to have a job?" 

"You mean to say you have work for my boys? You come here 
with a job?" 

Those boys joined the working squad, went out and picked beans. 

The father apologized and said, "I have misjudged you." 

Those boys as well as the father now have an entirely changed 
attitude towards the law and towards citizenship. Success to that 
method. Success to the Utah school laws. Success to Milton Bennion 
who is recognized in the United States as a pioneer in moral teaching 
in the schools, and to others associated with him.

THE MEANS PROVIDED BY THE CHURCH ORGANIZATION 

But now, brethren of the Church, do you realize that we have here 
in the organization of the Church the best means in all the world of 
training the youth? Your Deacon Quorums, what are they but op- 
portunities for the young boys to meet together and satisfy that spirit, 
of brotherhood? There are 1041 quorums in which over 30,000 boys 
ranging from 12 to 15 years of age meet every week under environ- 
ment which is faith-promoting and character developing. Similarly 
grouped in 623 quorums are 18,500 Teachers, and 610 quorums over 
23,000 Priests. Bishop, what is your Priests' quorum but an oppor- 
tunity for you as a president of that quorum to get those young men 
around you as your bodyguard, young men who carve the social atmos- 
phere of the ward, and whom you may lead in paths of honor, trust- 
worthiness and faith? Continuing with auxiliaries, what do we find? 
In the Primary association 85,000 children between 4 years and 12 
in the case of boys, and 4 years and 14 in the case of girls, all most 
efficiently supervised and instructed. In the Y. M. M. I. A. there are 
42,813 youths, and in the Y. L. M. I. A. 42,042 young women. In the 
Sunday School 229,793 members exclusive of officers and teachers. 

I look upon the organization of the Church as the greatest oppor- 
tunity ever given to man for the proper training of youth. I make 
the statement without fear of successful contradiction. I hope the 
national investigating committee will look into the opportunities fur- 
nished by this Church. I hope while they are investigating they will 
consider the fact that Joseph Smith, when he outlined this organization, 
was not twenty-five years of age, unlearned in sociology, unschooled in 
economics ; yet after one hundred years that which he gave by in- 
spiration of God stands as the best social condition that the world has. 

NOT ALL BAD 

God bless the officers of the Priesthood quorums and auxiliaries, 
that they may go forth from this Conference with renewed determina- 
tion to reach the youth. Young people are not bad, they just need 
guidance, that is all, and if you are leaders you may depend upon it the 
boys and girls of the Church will follow. Even these criminals in 
Chicago are not all bad. In the race riot of 1919, one of the gangs, 
called the "Dirty Dozen," started out one day to harass the negroes- 
just a group of boys misled. One of the boys jerked the trolley cord 
and held the rope while the others jumped into the car to create a 
disturbance and throw out the occupants. While he was holding that 
rope a negro woman slashed him over the heart with a razor. Only 
one of the gang was caught, the others fled, but the one caught said 
he heard "Shakey," the boy who was cut, say as his last words, "What 
will mother think ?" He was not all bad when his dying thought was a 
regret that he had wounded his mother. 

I tell you the time has come for the nation, for the state, for the 
home, for the Church, to look more directly and particularly after the 



14 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



boys and girls and train them in the way they should go, and when 
they are old few will depart from it. 

God help us to utilize the quorums and the organizations to that 
end, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 

President of the Southern States Mission 

Brethren and sisters : Weakness is given to make a man humble ; 
therefore, I feel very humble and dependent upon God at this moment. 

The Assyrians, with horses and chariots, sought to apprehend 
Elisha. "Fear not," said the prophet, "for they that be with us are more 
than they that be with them." 

I believe this truth applies to the Latter-day Saints. Ever since 
the world began all the prophets and righteous men have beheld in 
vision the work that we are doing and they have rejoiced in this glori- 
ous day. 

When Napoleon formed his armies in battle array in Egypt, 
pointing to the pyramids he said : "Soldiers, forty centuries look down 
upon you." All the former dispensations merging into this dispensa- 
tion are looking upon us. God help us that they may behold in our 
labors richness of spirituality and steadiness of purpose. 

The Prophet Mormon in his teachings says that angels have a 
ministry : 

"Nay; neither have angels ceased to minister unto the children of men. 

"For behold, they are subject unto him, to minister according to the word 
of his command, showing themselves unto them of strong faith and a firm 
mind in every form of godliness. 

"And the office of their ministry is to call men unto repentance, and to 
fulfil and to do the work of the covenants of the Father, which he hath made 
unto the children of men, to prepare the way among the children of men, by 
declaring the word of Christ unto the chosen vessels of the Lord, that they 
may bear testimony of him. 

"And by so doing, the Lord God prepareth the way that the residue of men 
may have faith in Christ, that the Holy Ghost may have place in their hearts, 
according to the power thereof ; and after this manner bringeth to pass the 
Father, the covenants which he hath made unto the children of men" (Moroni 
7:29-32). 

We proclaim in humility, dear brethren and sisters, that Mormon 
foretold the mission of his splendid son, Moroni, and that Moroni 
did appear to a chosen vessel of the Lord, even the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, who with magnificent courage and firm in the faith of the 
living God proclaimed his message to the nations of the earth. With 
angels we share a heavenly gift, even the gift of the Holy Ghost, for 
the Book of Mormon tells us that angels speak by the power of the 
Holy Ghost. 

We are told in holy writ that angels are our fellow servants, and 
the Apostle Paul tells us that we are laborers together with God in the 
accomplishment of his glorious purposes. Is not this a high honsr? 
Is not this a sacred responsibility? Ought not this knowledge to 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 



15 



inspire us with the loftiest ideals and devoted service to our Heavenly 
Father? 

I thank God for the gift of the Holy Ghost. It is this gift that 
distinguishes us from people described by a great writer as "the wind- 
mill species." Established in the truth by this personal testimony, we 
have faith in our leaders. The pilot in steering his vessel with its 
precious cargo of lives and merchandise would imperil both by steering 
according to weather vanes. But with the compass he will steer his 
ship through dark clouds knowing that beyond lies the haven of security 
and safety. 

So in this Church we are not guided by the theories of certain 
men which "with the hour begin and end," but we are guided by the 
compass of divine revelation which is in the possession of the leaders 
of this Church, even the revelations of God, the gift of the Holy 
Ghost, which God pours into every believing heart, and as we follow the 
direction of this compass we shall be guided safely into the harbor of 
eternal life. 

Oh, I thank God that we are following our Lord Jesus Christ. 
We desire to do his will. We love him. We love God our Heavenly 
Father. I bear you my humble testimony that God is with this people, 
that he is leading the Church, that Jesus Christ is our Redeemer and 
Savior, and that he is our friend if we will keep his commandments. 
I rejoice in the Gospel because I know it is the power of God unto 
salvation, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER ARTHUR WINTER 

I need scarcely say to you that it is indeed a surprise to me to 
be called upon to speak to this vast audience. 

It has been my privilege to go forth on a short mission during 
the summer and visit the various missions of Europe. Many years 
ago I received two patriarchal blessings without any solicitation upon 
my part, and in each of those blessings a promise was made that was 
quite significant in the wording. I have often wondered how it could 
ever be realized. In each case the promise was made by the Patriarch 
that I should "travel from nation to nation" and preach the Gospel. 
The wording which is practically the same in both cases, was some- 
what peculiar; it was not that I should go from place to place, from 
county to county, or from state to state, but that I should travel 
"from nation to nation," and preach the Gospel. 

In this call that came to me from the Presidency of the Church, 
along with Bishop Wells, those two patriarchal blessings, upon that 
point, were literally fulfilled ; for I have in very deed traveled from 
nation to nation and preached the Gospel. 

Bishop Wells and I have visited every mission in Europe. First 
of all we had the opportunity of meeting with all the mission presidents 
of Europe in the city of Basel, Switzerland. We were with them 
in the closing sessions of their conference. The final session was a 
testimony meeting and I do not recall having attended a testimony 



16 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



meeting where the Spirit of God was poured out in richer abundance 
than it was at that time. 

The mission presidents of Europe are a splendid lot of men and 
are doing a magnificent work for the proclamation of the truth. They 
are led and supervised by President John A. Widtsoe, of the Council 
of the Twelve. He has a tremendous responsibility upon him, which 
he is discharging in a most remarkable manner. He is undertaking 
to systematize, organize and unify the work in all the missions abroad, 
so that the most effective work can be accomplished and the truth 
be made known in the most efficient manner. 

The Elders who are laboring in those missions are as fine a body 
of men as can be found anywhere on earth, and they are doing a 
marvelous work. Notwithstanding their youth and inexperience the 
Lord has touched their hearts. His Spirit is working with them and 
they are presenting the message of the Gospel in a very creditable 
manner. 

There are over thirty thousand members of the Church in the 
European missions and they are being organized as nearly as possible 
like the organizations at home. The priesthood work is being developed 
as fast as possible. The auxiliary work is showing a remarkable 
advance over the years gone by. The sisters are doing a splendid 
work in this particular. The wives of the presidents of the various 
missions are leading out and cooperating fully with their husbands. 
Sister Widtsoe especially is distinguishing herself by the intelligent 
and effective work she is doing among the sisters. The Relief Society, 
the Mutual Improvement Associations and the Sunday Schools, are 
all flourishing. The Primary Association has not yet been developed 
to the extent of the other organizations. But it is not being over- 
looked. These auxiliaries are more advanced now in the various 
missions of Europe than ever before, and are doing a splendid work in 
training and developing the people, both young and old. Many who are 
not of the Church belong to these associations, and through the in- 
fluence of little children the mothers and fathers are being made ac- 
quainted with the truth. 

I am happy to say that the feeling of the world toward the 
Latter-day Saints has changed materially since I last visited Europe. 
The press shows a marked change for the better in its attitude towards 
the Church. There is now a willingness to publish articles in refutation 
of the slanders that may be put forth by our enemies (for the devil is 
not dead yet and the Church still has enemies in Europe), and the 
papers generally are trying to be fair in their attitude upon the 
"Mormon" question. Moreover, they are opening their columns to us. 
When conferences are held it is not uncommon for the newspapers to 
send representatives to such gatherings, and they usually give a fair 
account of what transpires. 

I rejoice in the wonderful experience I have had through this 
opportunity of visiting Europe. The work of the various missions is 
progressing, and the Gospel is being taught in its purity and power. 



ELDER ARTHUR WINTER

However, there is one serious drawback to it all, and that is the in- 
difference which prevails among the people. Since the war, particularly, 
there has been a noticeable change in the religious attitude of the 
people of Europe. Where they formerly believed in the Bible, in the 
church, in the observance of the Sabbath, and in those things that tend 
to build up and uplift humanity, they have gradually assumed an attitude 
of indifference to all these things. They no longer have much use for 
religion or for the churches. That spirit is growing, and I do not 
know just how we are going to meet it. It is one of the problems of 
missionary work today. Formerly you could approach the people with 
the Bible and sustain the principles of the Gospel from the "good book." 
But today too many pay little or no attention to the Bible. The ap- 
proach therefore must be different. Our missionary methods and 
efforts will have to be changed somewhat in order to meet the changed 
situation. President Widtsoe is working along these lines, devoting 
a great deal of thought, time and energy to the development of other 
methods so as to meet the new conditions and get the people interested 
in the Gospel message. 

I want to say in closing, my brethren and sisters, that I am very 
happy in the work of the Lord. It is the dearest thing on earth to 
me. It is fifty years this month since I was baptized into the Church ; 
and out of that fifty years of experience in the Church I can testify to 
you today that I know this to be the work of the Lord. I know that 
God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God. 
And I know too that the Church is led by the inspiration of the Lord. 
The Lord has not forsaken it. He has not gone on a journey. He is 
guiding and directing the affairs of this Church. He is inspiring the 
leaders of the Church. For forty odd years I have been in close 
contact with them. I have seen their, lives, and I am here to testify to 
you that in guiding the affairs of this Church they have been led by the 
inspiration of the Almighty. Wie need have no fears as to the future 
of the work of the Lord, for it is his work and will triumph and I 
bear testimony to it in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS 

Of the First Council of Seventy 
St. Paul said: 

"For though I preach the Gospel, I have nothing to glory of : for necessity 
is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel! 

"For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward : but if against my will, 
a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me." 

He lea ves rather unsaid what he means by that significant remark : 
"If I preach not the gospel, then a dispensation of the gospel is com- 
mitted unto me." 

But undoubtedly he implies that a very serious consequence would 
rest upon him if he failed in this mission that had been granted unto him. 
I think very likely the contemplation of another prophet, who had 



18 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



also been commissioned of the Lord to carry a message unto Israel in 
Babylon, will throw some light upon the subject. 

Some time after the Babylonian captivity began the Lord called 
Ezekiel and sent him to Babylon to convey to Israel his mind and will. 
So Ezekiel departed on that mission. When he arrived in Babylon 
he seemed loath to undertake the responsibility. We are told that he 
sat by the river that ran through the city, doubtless in deep contempla- 
tion of the work before him. The Lord, it would appear, felt that 
he was somewhat delinquent in discharging the tremendous responsi- 
bility given him, so he spoke unto the prophet to this effect: 

"Son of man, I have placed thee upon the watchtower and given thee 
my word unto Israel." 

"When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest 
him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to 
save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood 
mill I require at thine hand. 

"Yet if thou warn the wicked man, and he turn not from his wickedness, 
nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered 
thy soul." 

I think that in all probability this quotation from Ezekiel helps 
us to explain in something like fulness the words of Paul upon the 
subject of responsibility of those who receive commission and a mission 
from the Lord to the world. 

For the few minutes that I address you I would like to make a 
somewhat wider application of this same principle that we see operating 
here in the case of individual prophets. Let us remember that re- 
sponsibility can rest upon a people, a nation, or a church in the same 
manner that it can rest upon an individual. Israel demonstrates the 
truth of that statement. I mean' the experience of the Hebrew nation; 
which people, after God had delivered them from Egypt, were called 
to be his witness in the earth — witness of his being and the kind of 
being he was, his character, his attributes; and also to be witness of 
his law which he revealed to them through Moses. The conditions 
making them his witness to the world were such that in any event 
they would be his witnesses. If by observing his law, keeping his com 
mandments, and honoring him, then by a realization of the highest 
blessings that God could confer upon a people; they would be strength- 
ened and upheld as a people especially blessed of the Lord. In the 
event of their failure to live up to the requirements of his law, and 
do honor to him, then such calamities would fall upon them as would 
testify of God's displeasure upon those who ignore his laws and 
commandments. And the Hebrew nation under these conditions has 
been a witness for God, perhaps the most remarkable miracle in all 
history. I remember that Bishop Joseph Lightfoot, a Christian Bible 
scholar of high standing of the last century, declared that men could 
disbelieve every other miracle in the Bible and yet the Hebrew nation 
would be the outstanding miracle of all miracles that are mentioned. 
The experiences through which they had passed; and they, we know, 



ELDER B. H. ROBERTS 19 

have chiefly been witnesses of God through the things which they 
suffered because of their disobedience unto the Lord. 

The full passage by Bishop Lightfoot is as follows: 

"You may question, if you will, every single prophecy in the Old Testament, 
but the whole history of the Jews is one continuous prophecy more distinct 
and articulate than all. You may deny, if you will, every successive miracle 
which is recorded therein; but again, the history of the Jews is from first 
to last one stupendous miracle, more wonderful and convincing than all." 
{Quarterly Review, April, 1886). 

But I want to apply this principle, introduced by Paul's statement, 
to a Church, more especially to our Church, in which the ends of the 
earth are met, being the Church of the new dispensation, the Dispensa- 
tion of the Fulness of Times, which shall include within it all previous 
dispensations, for in it shall be realized that refreshing that was prom- 
ised by St. Peter when he said, the heavens would receive and retain 
Jesus Christ until the times of refreshing should come from the 
presence of the Lord, and Jesus Christ should be again revealed from 
heaven, made known to the people ; and all things spoken by the mouths 
of the prophets from the beginning of the world should be gathered 
together into one, and be established in this great forth-coming dis- 
pensation (Acts 3:19-22). 

This is the Church we are supremely interested in, this Church 
of the Dispensation of the Fulness of Times. God has committed to 
this Church his Gospel, his law. He has commissioned men and given 
unto the Church its organization wherein is his divine authority. He 
has commissioned this Church to preach the Gospel to every nation 
and kindred and tongue and people. And in a remarkable way he has 
made this Church the means through which he will instruct the world 
and administer to all men the ordinances of the Gospel. By reason 
of- this large commission this Church extends its interests from the 
first dispensation to this last dispensation, from Adam until the present 
time. God has made it all inclusive. It therefore becomes the official 
exponent of the whole scheme of life and salvation that God has de- 
signed for the world, the advocacy of the truth; and the defense 
especially of God's revealed truth, is lodged with this organization to- 
gether with the tremendous responsibility that goes with this divine 
commission. 

Moreover, the Lord has given special instruction for our guidance, 
the guidance of his priesthood — how we may acquit ourselves and 
become efficiently instructed and prepared to discharge these high re- 
sponsibilities. I want to call your attention to that. 

Ninety-eight years ago a group of elders had assembled in Kirt- 
land — they were waiting the coming on of a conference at which they 
were expected to receive organization and instructions to go out with 
the message of the Lord to the people in the country round about. 
Most of them had come in from missions. .While thus in waiting 
they inquired of the Prophet for the word of the Lord respecting them 
and their future labors. It was on this occasion that the Lord gave 



20 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



what to me is one of the most wonderful, as it is also one of the most 
beautiful, of our revelations. It seems that the Prophet was inclined 
to regard it somewhat in this light, for he named it "The Olive Leaf," 
because it was intended, in certain parts of it, to make reconciliation 
of differences that had sprung up between the elders down at Inde- 
pendence, Missouri, and the elders of the Church in Kirtland. Coming 
to that part of it which was to be instruction to this group of Elders, 
the Lord said to them: 

"I give unto you a commandment that ye shall continue in prayer and 
fasting from this time forth. 

"And I give unto you a commandment that you shall teach one another 
in the doctrine of the kingdom. 

"Teach ye diligently and my grace shall attend you, that you may be instructed 
more perfectly in theory — " 

They did not disregard theory. Some people are disposed to sneer 
at theoretical things, but the Lord required that these Elders should 
be instructed more perfectly in theory — 

" — in principle, in doctrine, in the law of the gospel, in all things that pertain 
unto the kingdom of God, that are expedient for you to understand. 

"Of things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things 
which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass ; 
things which are at home, things which are abroad ; the wars and the perplexities 
of the nations, and the judgments which are on the land; and a knowledge 
also of countries and of kingdoms — " 

And now observe this, I pray you. First, hold in your conscious- 
ness the width and length and height and depth of this great field of 
knowledge in relation to things of the past and the future ; things to 
come; things of a national character; things in the earth itself, and 
under the earth. It seems to me that an effort was made to circum- 
scribe the whole field of knowledge, human and divine; historical 
and philosophical. It is a tremendous designation of the field to be 
scored for knowledge of the things that are. And now, as I was 
about to say, mark the purpose of the instruction, for the paragraph 
continues : 

"That ye may be prepared in all things when I shall send you again to 
magnify the calling whereunto I have called you, and the mission with which 
I have commissioned you." 

And then later, by the way, I ought not to omit that, the Lord said : 

"Verily I say unto you, my friends, call your solemn assembly, as I have 
commanded you. 

"And as all have not faith, seek ye diligently and teach one another words 
of wisdom ; yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom ; seek learning 
even by study and also by faith." 

You will observe that there are two sources mentioned here from 
which men may obtain learning and wisdom. One is through access 
to the treasures of knowledge by faith; but as all do not have that 
gift of obtaining knowledge by faith, then "seek ye wisdom from the 



ELDER B. H. ROBERTS , 21 



best books;" and of course there can be no possible objection to men 
thus instructed of the Lord obtaining wisdom both by faith and also 
by research in experimentation, and by becoming familiar with the 
great truths that are taught in the best books. 

Well, that I think discloses somewhat the responsibility of the 
Church to become efficient as teachers of those truths which God has 
revealed, and also as to all truth, because I recognize the fact that the 
Lord from time to time has granted through his prophets, especially, 
great flashes of light that men call philosophical truth, as well as moral 
and spiritual truth and admonition. And I regard it the duty of the 
Church to represent and uphold and sustain in the exercise of the 
mission given to her of God the so-called philosophical truths of the 
revelations of God, as well as the important doctrinal truth and or- 
dinances of the Gospel that he has restored. It is binding upon the 
Church, from my viewpoint, that she shall weave into beautiful har- 
mony, as I believe it can be woven, the truth that God has revealed, 
and also those undoubted truths which men, and especially in this 
wonderful age, have been developing by their profound research and 
experimentations. A new world has opened to the knowledge of men 
in these last thirty years. It is called in their literature upon the 
subject, a New Renaissance, and that renaissance of knowledge has 
brought to the scientific and intellectual world and the philosophical 
world new conceptions in relation to the structure of the universe, 
and also its immensity, its almost unbelievable greatness. For now, 
whereas in past times we have spoken of the "solar system," we speak 
of that galaxy which we regard as constituting our universe — con- 
sisting of more than one billion blazing suns, and many thoughtful 
writers are ready to concede the possibility at least of these suns being 
the centers of opaque, circling planets, as is the case with our own 
sun, for our sun is like the other billions of suns that make up the 
galaxy. Now they burn holes into space by improved telescopes, 
supplemented by the great "photographic eye of science," the photo- 
graph-telescope, until a multiplicity of galaxies of blazing suns equal 
perhaps to our own galaxy, are to be found out in the depths of space, 
beyond the galaxy to which our solar system belongs. 

And so this larger view of the universe, together with other dis- 
coveries in geology, the science of earth structure; and biology, the 
science of life ; and in chemistry as well as in astronomy,- — the ideas 
of men in the last thirty years have undergone a complete revolution 
you may say. 

I am sorry to call attention to the fact, but I must needs do so, 
that while there are a few exceptions to the notion among scientific 
men, it is safe to say that the trend of intellectual thought and scien- 
tific investigation and deduction holds out the idea of the coming of a 
dead universe, and also it denies — this trend of thought — even the 
possibility or the desirability of individual immortality, even the im- 
mortality of the race. Of course if the universe is headed towards a 
complete universal deadness, all forms of life go into that universe; 



22 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



and that is the trend, I wish to say, of scientific thought. Others, 
however, and some of them the most prominent in the intellectual life 
of our times, hold to the fact that as these blazing suns and many worlds 
that may attend upon them are wasting away, matter being annihilated, 
— contrary to the old philosophy — matter being annihilated, radiant 
energy is being developed in its stead. There are those who believe 
that radiant energy reaches a point at which it undergoes reconstruc- 
tion, and that there is a building up of the universe, as well as a 
tearing down of it ; but that is not the trend of scientific thought. 

Now, in relation to these things, I can only say at this time that 
the prophet of God of this New Dispensation has announced this 
great principle as to the eternity of the universe, the immortality 
of individual men, as well as of races— he has given the world to 
understand through our Book of Mormon that there is a God in heaven 
who has created all things, things to act and things to be acted upon ; 
and all the researches of the scientists bring us at last only to those 
two things the positive and negative, out of which the unexhaustive 
matter of the space depths is brought into tangible being and reality, 
and the great drama of creation goes on though there be disintegration 
of worlds and integration of them. 

And so the Lord has made known unto his Church these great 
truths. It is my belief that the Church is the custodian of those great 
philosophical and scientific truths, and it is for us to be champions of 
those things and to harmonize them with the truths which men have 
discovered, that the truths of God may be vindicated. 

This is our new field of labor, you may say, at the commencement 
of this second century of the existence of the Church. I believe it 
is up to us to fortify the youth of our people and our missionaries that 
they shall go out into the world with a knowledge of these things 
that are in fact included in that great commandment which God gave 
to his servant ninety-eight years ago, that they may go out efficient 
to meet the world in respect to all the truths that God has revealed, 
and the reasonable implications that grow out of them. 

I pray you do not regard this as any attempt on my part to make 
any adequate statement of the development of the new knowledge of 
the world of the last thirty years. It is not so. I merely call your 
attention to this vast new field in which we ought to put our feet 
as far forward as any other people in the world, because we can do it 
with the assurance that God has revealed great truths in relation to 
these matters. So regard this, my brethren, as merely a mentioning 
of this broad field of which the ministry of the Church and the educa- 
tional department of the Church should take notice. 

May the Lord bless us, we men of the second century in the 
Church. May we discharge our duties and responsibilities as faithfully 
and as successfully as did the men of the first century. If we do that 
we shall stand without reproach, a light given of God to the world. 
May the Lord bless us to that end, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, 
Amen.

The hymn, '"How Firm a Foundation, Ye Saints of the Lord," 
was sung by the congregation, after which the closing prayer was 
offered by Elder Leonard G. Ball, President of the Idaho Falls Stake, 
and the Conference adjourned until 2:00 p. m. 

FIRST DAY 

AFTERNOON MEETING 

At 2 o'clock the second session of the Conference was opened 
by President Heber J. Grant announcing that the congregation would 
sing the hymn, "Guide us, O Thou Great Jehovah." 

After the singing, Elder Joseph S. Hansen, President of the 
Gunnison Stake, offered the opening prayer. 

The congregation then sang the hymn, "Do What is Right." 

ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

I hope and pray that I may have the guidance of the Spirit of 
the Lord in what I shall say this afternoon. 

Very timely counsel and instruction were given in the meeting 
this morning. I was pleased that our attention was called to the duties 
of parents and teachers and their responsibility in looking after the 
interests of our children and the youth of Israel and in imparting 
proper instruction while they are young so that they may not depart 
from it. 

I believe fully that we are living in the last days; that we are 
approaching very rapidly the advent of the Son of God on the earth. 
President Grant made reference to this in his remarks this morning. 

AN EXAMPLE IN RIGHTEOUSNESS 

This afternoon I would like, if I may be led to do so, to say a 
few words to the Latter-day Saints by way of counsel and perhaps 
admonition. We have been informed that the world is full of lawless- 
ness, and especially is this the case in our own country which is dedicated 
as a land of liberty. The Latter-day Saints are as a city set on a hill 
that cannot be hid, and like the candle that gives light to all who are 
in the house. It is our duty to let our light shine as an example in 
righteousness, not only to the people among whom we live, but to the 
peoples of the whole earth. It is our duty to be law-abiding. We are 
commanded by the Lord to keep his commandments and also to be 
obedient to the laws of the land. Having the light of the Gospel as 
it has been revealed, we are under obligation to set examples in 
righteousness before all men. We have been endowed with power from 
on high. We have been blessed with direct revelation through our 
prophets. We know the Authorities of the Church are entitled to 



24 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



inspiration, and that they receive it. We know that we have been 
guided by revelation and commandment from the Lord. With this 
light and knowledge before us, there is no place in the Church for the 
disobedient and the rebellious, the violator of the law. There is no 
place for those who do not have in their hearts a love of the truth 
and who remain unrepentant. When I say this I do not mean to 
convey the thought that we have no sympathy for the lawbreaker and no 
love for the unrepentant. It is our commission to go into all the 
world and cry repentance and endeavor to save the sinner; but if men 
will not repent who are in the Church, and if they will not be obedient 
to the teachings of the Church, then they are not entitled to member- 
ship. It is the duty of every member to be repentant, to be humble, 
to be willing to receive counsel, and to walk in the light as it has been 
revealed to us. 

LAW-ABIDING CITIZENS 

Today many of the laws on our statutes are ridiculed. Some of 
the people stand in opposition to them because they have been misled 
in believing that mistakes have been made. Others are standing in 
opposition to the law because they have malicious and evil hearts. 
The Latter-day Saints are quite generally law-abiding citizens, both 
of the nation and of the kingdom of God. We should be such, for we 
are under covenant to walk in the light of the truth, to be obedient to 
the statutes and the judgments which have been given us for our 
guidance both civilly and spiritually as members of the Church. 

IN A DAY OF WICKEDNESS 

We are living in a day of wickedness. I do not believe, as some 
seem to think, that the world is growing better. I cannot make that 
thought appear consistent with the word of the Lord, for he has 
emphatically said otherwise. If the world is becoming more righteous, 
then the coming of the Lord will of necessity have to be postponed, 
because he is going to come in the day of wickedness, in the day of 
judgment, and when vengeance against the ungodly is in his heart. 
At that time he will cleanse the earth of its unrighteousness, and we 
are told there will be "few men left." 

Let me read one or two passages of scripture which bear upon 
this point. These sayings have been given us for our guidance and 
for the guidance of the whole world if they will receive them. The 
Lord says in a revelation given shortly after the organization of the 
Church : 

"And ye are called to bring to pass the gathering of mine elect ; for mine 
elect hear my voice and harden not their hearts ; 

"Wherefore the decree hath gone forth from the Father that they shall be 
gathered in unto one place upon the face of this land, to prepare their hearts and 
be prepared in all things against the day when tribulation and desolation are 
sent forth upon the wicked. 

"For the hour is nigh and the day soon at hand when the earth is ripe; and 
all the proud and they that do wickedly shall be as stubble; and I will burn 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 25 



them up, saith the Lord of Hosts, that wickedness shall not be upon the earth ; 

"For the hour is nigh, and that which was spoken by mine apostles must 
be fulfilled ; for as they spoke so shall it come to pass ; 

"For I will reveal myself from heaven with power and great glory, with 
all the hosts thereof, and dwell in righteousness with men on earth a thousand 
years, and the wicked shall not stand." 

Again in another revelation the Lord said : 

"Behold, I, the Lord, utter my voice, and it shall be obeyed. 

"Wherefore, verily I say, let the wicked take heed, and let the rebellious 
fear and tremble; and let the unbelieving hold their lips, for the day of wrath 
shall come upon them as a whirlwind, and all flesh shall know that I am God. 

"And he that seeketh signs shall see signs, but not unto salvation." 

So the Lord is going to come when the cup of iniquity is full. 
He has said : 

"Mine indignation is soon to be poured out without measure upon the 
nations ; and this will I do when the cup of their iniquity is full." 

Here is the testimony of the Lord to Enoch as it is given in the 
Pearl of Great Price: 

"And the Lord said unto Enoch: As I live, even so will I come in the 
last days, in the days of wickedness and vengeance, to fulfil the oath which 
I have made unto you concerning the children of Noah. 

"And the day shall come that the earth shall rest, but before that day the 
heavens shall be darkened, and a veil of darkness shall cover the earth ; and 
the heavens shall shake, and also the earth; and great tribulations shall be 
among the children of men, but my people will I preserve." 

THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE WATCHMEN UPON THE TOWERS 

Brother B. H. Roberts, this morning, called our attention to the 
fact that we are watchmen upon the towers of Israel. It is our duty 
to warn, to admonish, to teach, in righteousness, the Latter-day Saints 
and all peoples. I think we are under responsibility to warn the world 
and call the attention of the people to these predictions and cry among 
them repentance, and ask them to repent, that they too may receive 
the Gospel and thus escape from these calamities and tribulations which 
even now are being poured out upon the nations of the earth. The 
Lord has promised us that Zion may escape from this destruction and 
trouble if she will hearken to his commandments and walk in his 
statutes. But Zion will not escape unless she is willing to walk in 
humility and obedience. If we refuse to hearken to counsel, if we 
refuse to observe the laws of the Gospel and to live in humility, faith and 
love, then we will be visited "with sore affliction, with pestilence, with 
plague, with sword, with vengeance, with devouring fire." Therefore, 
I feel it my duty to cry repentance and to warn the people. 

OUR DUTY ON THE SABBATH DAY 

I pray that these things may pass us by, but I fear they will not 
unless there is sincere repentance in Israel. As I travel up and down 
through the stakes of Zion, I discover that there are those among the 



26 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Latter-day Saints who are violators of the Sabbath day. Now. the 
breaking of this great law is not confined to those who are not of us ; 
but in our own communities the Sabbath day is set aside as a day of 
pleasure rather than a day for worshiping the Lord and for reflection 
and study concerning the things which pertain to eternal life. I think 
it is deplorable and the Lord will not hold us guiltless. 

Latter-day Saints have no business, with the Gospel before us, 
and the direct commandments we have received from the Lord, to go 
to the picture shows on Sunday. Sunday is our Sabbath. The Lord 
has set it apart as such and has commanded us to observe it faithfully. 
We have no right to go to pleasure resorts on that day. We have no 
business at the baseball games, and other places of amusement on this, 
the Lord's day ; but should be found inside our church buildings which 
have been dedicated for the worship of the Lord our God. We should 
go to the house of the Lord, and there confess our sins, partake of 
the sacrament and receive instruction in praise and thanksgiving, 
rejoicing in the truth. This is our duty on the Sabbath day, and we 
should be engaged in no other thing, for this is a day appointed unto 
us in which to rest from our labors and to pay our devotions to the 
Most High. 

NEED OF REPENTANCE 

We have been warned many times, and I say, my brethren and 
sisters, there is room for repentance among the Latter-day Saints. 
We had better repent or many of us will find ourselves caught in the 
snares and in the net. The Lord has said that when he comes those 
who will not hearken to the voice of his servants, and more especially 
to the voice of Jesus Christ, our Lord, shall be cut off from among 
the people. There will be many among those in Zion and who belong 
to the Church, who shall be called upon to mourn and to lament, as 
did the Nephites of old, unless we turn with full purpose, to the 
worship of the Lord and the keeping of his commandments. That 
we may tum unto the Lord and remember the covenants we have 
made with him and thus be worthy in the day of his coming, I humbly 
pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER REY L. PRATT 

Of the First Council of Seventy and President of the Mexican Mission 

I sincerely trust, my brethren and sisters, that the same spirit 
that has actuated the speakers at the morning session, and so far this 
'afternoon, may be given to me. My only desire is to bear witness to 
the truth, to assist in its establishment in the world, and to forward 
the work of the Church, and the preaching of the Gospel among 
the nations of the earth. My desire is to see righteousness established 
among men and selfishness and wickedness done away. 

I realize very greatly how dependent I am, as an individual, upon 
the Lord to assist me and to keep me in the path of duty and from 



ELDER REY L. PRATT 



27 



going off either to the right or to the left, because of the perplexing 
conditions that exist and the controversies that there are among men. 
And, if it be hard to live individually in keeping with the truth, so is 
it hard also to be sure always that a person is teaching the truth. 

When Jesus Christ stood before Pilate he was asked whether he be 
a king, and he said : 

"My kingdom is not of this world : if my kingdom were of this world, 
then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered unto the Jews; 
but now is my kingdom not from hence. 

"Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king, then? Jesus answered, 
Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came 
I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is 
of the truth heareth my voice. 

"Pilate saith unto him, What is truth?" 

As I come in contact with men and things in the world today, it 
seems to me, my brethren and sisters, that many men are wondering, 
"What is truth?" The Savior said that he came into the world, and 
for this purpose was he born, to bear witness of the truth in the world ; 
and I find joy and consolation and comfort in looking to him for a 
witness of truth concerning things that perplex me, and I think the 
world might well do likewise. ! 

Among people who profess to believe in Jesus Christ as the Re- 
deemer of the world and the great Teacher that they in their churches, 
and according to their creeds, follow, there are controversies over 
points of doctrine and in regard to the very existence of God and his 
personality. Still they do not look to him for an answer to that query, 
"What is truth?" concerning all of these things. The personality 
of God is a question that is being discussed in a spirit of controversy 
and has been for many years. Many men deny the existence of God 
as a personality, as a being, other than a diffused Spirit throughout 
the immensity of space. 

Jesus Christ said that he came to bear witness of the truth, and 
of that truth he has borne witness unto us. Philip asked him upon 
one occasion to manifest the Father unto him and his associates, and 
the Savior seemed a little surprised that such a query should be made 
after he had been with them, the Twelve, so long and had taught them. 
He very pointedly said to Philip: "He that hath seen me hath seen 
the Father." 

My brethren and sisters, there is your manifestation and your 
witness of truth concerning God. It is given by him whose mission 
it was to bear witness to the truth in the world. Every teaching, 
then, of the Savior, if it be his mission to bear witness of the truth, 
is truth, taught to our Father's children for their salvation here upon 
the earth. "The Gospel of Jesus Christ," Paul says, "is the power of 
God unto salvation," and this is true. It is the witness of Jesus Christ 
in the world, of the truth. 

The question that is perplexing now, brethren and sisters, is 
where is the truth in the world today ? We who- go out in the world to 
preach the Gospel come in contact with men who contend tenaciously 



28 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



that they are teaching the truth, that the church they represent is 
the true church of God ; that their concept of the Father and of the 
Son and of the Holy Ghost is a true concept; and still we find them 
differing among themselves, and we differ from all of them, prac- 
tically speaking, in most of these vital points. So where is the truth 
today? Since the minds of men have been confused, and men, seem- 
ingly, have gone astray from the truth, or at least are confused as to 
where it is located, has there been a remanifestation of it? 

I maintain, my brethren and sisters, that Joseph Smith, as a 
prophet raised up of God, not equal of course to Jesus Christ in any 
sense of the word, but in the same spirit, came into the world to bear 
witness of the truth today, through a restoration of it, just the same 
as Jesus Christ came into the world to bear witness of the truth when 
he came ; and in all essential points his witness concurs with the witness 
of Jesus Christ. . 

What was the witness of Joseph Smith, when a mere boy, con- 
cerning the personality of God? We all know that there was great 
confusion in the world at that particular time, and when Joseph Smith 
went into the woods to pray I doubt that he had a well defined idea 
or concept of Deity, or at least a concept as well defined as he had 
after he had so prayed and received a manifestation of the Father. 
He came from out that forest and boldly declared, to the day of his 
death, that there came into his presence a being after whose image 
and in whose likeness he was formed, — in other words, a man, an 
exalted man, who proclaimed himself to be the Father of another being 
there also in his presence, they two being in the same likeness ; and 
he gave command to Joseph Smith to listen to the voice of his Son. 

That is the witness of Joseph Smith concerning our Father in 
heaven — that he is a being with body, parts, and passions, in whose 
image and likeness mankind is formed. He bears witness that the 
Son is like him, and he bore witness to the end of his days that such 
was the truth. From the very moment that he announced these things 
he was confronted with persecution that was bitter. He no doubt 
realized that by retracting, and I think was told that should he retract, 
this persecution would cease. But he bore testimony that he felt like 
Paul of old must have felt when he saw a vision, when a light en- 
veloped him, when he heard and *saw the Redeemer of the world. 
Joseph said : 

"I know that I have seen a light, and that in that light I saw two personages, 
and they are God the Father and his Son, Jesus Christ; and who am I, that 
I should deny God, for I know that I know these things, and I know likewise 
that God knows that I know them." 

If we will carefully analyze the teachings of Joseph Smith, not 
only in this particular but in regard to every principle of the Gospel 
that through him has been established, we will find that they concur 
with the witness of truth manifested and established by Jesus Christ 
when he was among the children of men. So I think that we can 
well look to this as the means and as the key whereby we may know. 



ELDER REY L. PRATT 



29 



I bear you my witness, my brethren and sisters, that I know that 
God lives. I know that Jesus Christ is the Savior of the world. I 
know that the Gospel, as restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith, 
is the Gospel of Jesus Christ. It is the power of God unto salvation, 
and it will, in its unfolding, answer every query and every problem that 
confronts the world. I have absolute and abiding faith in these things, 
and am willing to trust to the Lord. Perhaps a witness has not yet 
been borne to every truth. There may be marvelous truths yet to be 
revealed to the children of men, and the Lord, in his own way and 
through his Spirit, will make these things known to his children as 
they may be useful unto them. I think that we should search for truth ; 
we should strive to know it; we should strive to learn it. Only truth 
can free the world from the errors that are in it today. Only truth 
can bring about a better condition in the world, and less hatred and 
strife and bitterness and misery among the children of men. I mean 
truth if it goes into the hearts of men and men live by the truth. The 
Savior says: "If you will follow after my words, and believe in them, 
you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free." I main- 
tain that if the truth is planted in the heart of man, and he lives in 
accordance with the truth as it comes to him through the inspiration 
of the Lord, that he is willing to pour out on all those who seek him, 
it will relieve mankind and the human race of all the ills that beset 
them. 

May the Lord help us to appreciate the truth ; and to become free 
by knowing it and by living in harmony with it, is my prayer, in the 
name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

Our twelfth Article of Faith says, "We believe * * * in obeying, 
honoring, and sustaining the law." There are those who, looking upon 
this as a religious statement, will ridicule it. But are there any who 
will ridicule the words of Lincoln? "Bad laws, if they exist, should 
be repealed as soon as possible ; still, while they continue in force, they 
should be religiously observed." 

REVOLT NATURAL TO AMERICANS 

My purpose, this afternoon, is to appeal to you to live in accord- 
ance with the provisions of the Constitution, to obey the laws of our 
country. 

The American people have a natural inclination to break the law. 
Our nation was cradled in revolt. Our Declaration of Independence 
and the oft-repeated speeches of the Revolutionary period keep fanned 
into a flame that old revolutionary spirit — the spirit of defiance. Our 
Civil War is perhaps the greatest example of the belief of Americans 
in the right of revolt. 

In early days, when our numbers were few and when these few 



30 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



lived on sparsely settled areas, to have laws and to obey them was not 
a matter of supreme importance. 

REVOLT NOW DISASTROUS 

But in this mechanical age, with our great cities, our densely 
populated manufacturing centers, with hitherto undreamed-of wealth 
— wealth unequally distributed — if there were no laws, or if the laws 
are disobeyed by a large portion of the community, disaster will neces- 
sarily follow. 

Listen again to Lincoln : 

"Let every American, every lover of liberty, every well-wisher of posterity, 
swear by the blood of the Revolution never to violate in the least particular the 
laws of the country, and never to tolerate their violation by others. * * * Let 
reverence for the law be breathed by every American mother to the lisping babe 
that prattles on her lap. Let it be taught in schools, in seminaries, and in colleges." 

AIDING THE CAUSE OF ANARCHY 

If the day has come when a majority of the citizens of the United 
States will ridicule Lincoln and his ideas, when a majority will disobey 
our laws and disregard our Constitution, the republic is doomed, its 
destruction sure. 

The American Bar Association said recently by resolution that 
when lawyers, bankers, manufacturers, merchants, and social leaders 
disobey and scoff at the prohibition law, they are aiding the cause of 
anarchy, they are promoting mob violence, they are encouraging robbery. 

Many are intentionally breaking the prohibition law. By so doing 
they are aiding the cause of anarchy, promoting mob violence, and 
encouraging robbery. 

SWORN DUTY OF OFFICERS 

It is the sworn duty of officials to obey and defend the Constitu- 
tion and to discharge their duties with fidelity. Lincoln not only asks 
that every "American swear by the blood of the Revolution never 
to violate the laws of the country," but he appeals to every American 
"never to tolerate their violation by others." Must we tolerate public 
officials who themselves break the laws? 

I have made a solemn public pledge that I will not knowingly 
cast my vote for any man for any office unless I have been assured that 
he lives in accordance with the law. I am referring primarily to the 
prohibition law. 

TWELVE MILLION WOMEN ! 

The Washington Post of March 9, 1929, announced that ten 
national affiliated women's organizations had pledged the support of 
twelve million women of the United States to aid the dry drive of our 
country. The wife of the President was pointed to as a fine example 
of the way in which American women can help in the enforcement of 
the liquor law. That way is by refusing to participate in social or 
other functions where the law is broken. Are these twelve million 
women carrying out this pledge? 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 



31 



It is my intention to request those candidates for whom I may 
cast "my vote to answer the following: 

(a) Do you yourself live in accordance with the prohibition law? 

(b) Do you pledge yourself to refuse to -participate in any social 
or other function where the law is broken? 

The Constitution of the United States prohibits the manufacture, 
sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors. Our State law provides 
that the importing, advertising, giving away, exchanging, dispensing, 
or serving of liquor is "forever prohibited." It is unlawful also for 
any person to have intoxicating liquor in his possession. 

With such provisions in the statutes of our State and in the 
Constitution of our country, no public official can, in honor, violate the 
prohibition laws "in the least particular" nor can he "tolerate their 
violation by others." 

WHAT ONE HUNDRED CAN DO 

It has been said that if one hundred of the leading 'business men 
in Salt Lake City would live in accordance with the law and would not 
participate in social or other functions where the law is broken, soon 
much of our trouble with prohibition would be over. I propose to try 
to get the above-named pledge — 

(a) From at least 100 of the leading business men in Salt Lake 

City. 

(b) From at least 100 of the leading business men of the State 
of Utah. 

(c) From at least 100 of the leading business men, scientists, 
and statesmen of the United States. 

If the outstanding characters of our country can be induced not 
to participate in any function, social or otherwise, where the law is 
broken, and if our officers will do their sworn duty, then respect for 
the Constitution and the law will speedily be restored. 

PROHIBITION A SUCCESS 

Many assert that prohibition is a failure. I propose to present a 
few of the reasons why I regard it a success. 

Commander Evangeline Booth of the Salvation Army: "Sin 
and poverty in the slums of New York have decreased since prohibi- 
tion" (Readers' Digest, December, 1928). Before prohibition there 
were eight licensed saloons in every block of the bowery besides many 
unlicensed dance halls, brothels, and dives. Before prohibition the 
Salvation Army would often collect twelve hundred or thirteen hund- 
red men and women in one night who were too drunk to care for them- 
selves (Deseret News, Sept. 29, 1930). Only seven or eight of such 
characters are to be found now. 

In the Salvation Army Memorial Home they have 4,800 men each 
week. They do not find one drunken case in a thousand. Before 
prohibition in Jersey City, where there were 1200 saloons, 85,000 men 
on Saturday nights squandered their week's wages for liquor. In the 
gutters were to be seen many helpless men and helpless women. These 



32 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



were not homeless people. They were American workers and the money 
they had squandered "we of the Salvation Army knew was money 
needed for food, clothing, and shelter." In what industrial center of 
America does such a condition occur today? Vice has not disappeared, 
but it is not so bold as it was before prohibition. Then it was not un- 
common in the quarters of the Salvation Army to see a newly born 
baby lying in the arms of a drink-soaked mother. Such conditions 
do not exist now. 

DRINKING IN EUROPE 

"I wish all those who question whether any change for the better has 
been worked in America might observe conditions in the slums abroad. One 
of our London homes shelters about 200 women, three-quarters of whom are 
so absolutely degraded by drink as to appear beyond the hope of redemption. 
They are in rags and tatters, blear-eyed and indecent. Drink is responsible 
for their condition. No such condition can be found in America. 

"In many European industrial cities the Salvation Army is trying to work 
some sort of a_ regeneration in a type of women who are so degraded that one 
shudders to think of their condition. Such a lot of women could not be recruited 
in this land of prohibition where the volume of drinking is amazingly, gloriously, 
lessened. 

"Under prohibition the men uncharitably called 'bums' are disappearing. 
No longer is the Salvation Army besieged by a clamorous swarm of broken 
wrecks. Because of prohibition there is less misery among the poor and tens 
of thousands of homes have been reestablished because some Americans have 
stopped drinking." 

CONDITIONS IN COLLEGES 

Dr. Ruthven, president of the University of Michigan, says that 
during these prohibition times the students at Ann Arbor do not drink 
one-tenth as much liquor as they did when he was a student in the 
same institution before prohibition. One of the house rules of the 
Michigan Union at Ann Arbor reads : 

"Gambling, drinking of intoxicants, entering the building in an intoxicated 
condition, and bringing intoxicating liquors into the building, are each and all 
absolutely prohibited." 

The effect of prohibition at Yale University has been good. Pro- 
fessor Charles C. Clark: 

"I know whereof I speak, for I have been a member of the committee of 
discipline for a time dating back many years before prohibition. I know con- 
ditions intimately; I do not pretend that the students are all prohibitionists or 
are not drinking, but the change has been simply revolutionary. * * * In the old 
days we rarely troubled ourselves about a case of near intoxication if it had not 
resulted in some kind of public disorder, whereas now, intoxication of itself 
is regarded as calling for the severest penalty." 

Who, then, interested in the welfare of youth, will say that pro- 
hibition has not been a success? 

Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur, Secretary of the Interior, and former 
president of Stanford University: 

"There is no doubt that there has been a marked decrease in the use of 
alcoholic beverages among the college students with whom I come in contact.

Compared with the period before the present laws were put into effect, I should 
say that we have only one-tenth of the problem we had at that time in connection 
with liquor." 

WORKERS BECOME CAPITALISTS 

The savings of the country in 1926 were five times those of 1914. 
They increased from $6.71 per capita to $33.00 per capita. This is 
390%. The laborer is saving the money he once spent for drink. 

Since prohibition we have hundreds of thousands fewer arrests 
and jail commitments per annum for drunkenness. Our drink-caused 
poverty has decreased 74% and we have reached the lowest rate of 
pauperism known in the United States (Wayne B. Wheeler). 

Prohibition is making capitalists out of our workers, according to 
John G. Cooper of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers. "When 
the saloon closed, the 'poor man's club' vanished. It is being replaced 
by comfortable homes." The laborer of today is getting much more 
satisfaction out of an automobile and a decent home than he ever did 
out of the corner saloon. Who will say under such conditions that 
prohibition has not succeeded? 

IDEALS OF THE LIQUOR TRAFFIC 

"Bad as the situation is now, it is better than the pit out of which 
we were digged" (Harry Emerson Fosdick). In 1912 the Retail 
Liquor Dealers' Association met in Ohio. Here is an excerpt from 
one of the speeches : 

"We must create an appetite for liquor in the growing boys. Men who 
drink * * * will die, and if there is no new appetite created, our counters will 
be empty as well as our coffers. The open field for the creation of appetite is 
among the boys. Nickels expended in treats for the boys, will return in dollars 
to your tills after the appetite has been formed." 

That tells you something of conditions which prevailed before 
prohibition, something of the standards of those who are engaged 
in the liquor business. 

SHALL WE GO BACK? 

If the present situation is unsatisfactory, let us not forget con- 
ditions back in 1884, when in old New York the Board of Aldermen 
was composed of "12 saloon keepers, 4 saloon-controlled politicians — 
16 out of 24. That same year out of 1002 Democratic and Republican 
primaries and conventions held in New York City, 633 were held in 
saloons and 96 in places next door to saloons" (Harry Emerson Fos- 
dick). Many of the younger generation do not comprehend what 
conditions were in towns like Boston where before prohibition there 
was a saloon license for every 310 inhabitants. Do we desire to return 
to those conditions? 

Go to Great Britain and see the public houses with wire cages in 
front of them where little children, not allowed by law to be taken 
inside the public houses, are huddled "to fight like dogs and cats, while 
their mothers are inside getting drunk." What we have in the United 
States, bad as it is, is better than that condition (Fosdick).

GENERAL ■ CONFERENCE 



LIQUOR THE BREEDER OF CRIME 

Many look upon conditions today under prohibition and complain 
because they see everywhere bootleggers, hijackers, and lawlessness. 
Remember the liquor trade in the United States has always been lawless. 
"It always has vomited criminality across the commonwealth. It 
always conspired against any government that licensed it or any laws 
that were supposed to control it" (Fosdick). 

As evidence of the attitude of the liquor interests the National 
Liquor Dealers' Journal of September 10, 1913, said: 

"To us there is the handwriting on the wall and its interpretation spells 
doom. The liquor business is to blame. It seems incapable of learning any 
lesson of achievement or motive but profit. To perpetuate itself it has formed 
alliances with the slums. It deliberately aids the most corrupt political powers." 

The liquor trade has been lawless always. It will be lawless forever. 
Bad as conditions are there is no concession to the liquor interests 
that can be made in the law that will not make conditions worse. Any 
change in that direction will but increase the quantity of liquor con- 
sumed ; and increasing the amount of liquor used means increasing the 
amount of drunkenness, increasing the amount of crime, increasing 
the amount of poverty, increasing the amount of misery. 

BUSINESS DEMANDED PROHIBITION 

Prohibition did not come until the great economic interests of our 
country gave it their powerful support. Drink-befuddled brains cannot 
do America's work. From 1919 to 1925 the per capita productivity 
of the workers in the automobile business increased 100%. The pro- 
ductivity of all the workers in the rubber tire business increased 139% 
(Henry Ford). Throughout the United States, labor reports show 
"unbelievable increases" in the per capita production of American 
workmen. By making America more productive prohibition has suc- 
ceeded. 

Over thirty years ago the United States Commissioner of Labor 
investigated 7,205 American business institutions employing 1,750,000 
men. Three-quarters of these reported they never hired a man without 
investigating his drinking habits. Seven hundred reported they ab- 
solutely prohibited any drinking on the part of any employee within 
or outside of working hours. It was the hard-headed business men 
of America who furnished the driving power that brought the American 
people to prohibition. 

"rule g" 

Long before we had national prohibition the following "Rule G" 
was in operation on every first-class railroad: "The use of intoxicants 
by employees while on duty is prohibited ; their use or the frequenting 
of places where they are sold is sufficient cause for dismissal." Such 
prohibitory laws were not written by fanatics but by American business 
men. 

Here is another: 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 



35 



"Any employee found using intoxicating liquor — either during or after 
working hours — is warned that it will not be tolerated, and he is urged to dis- 
continue its use completely. If the promise is made, then the man is given 
another chance; otherwise he is discharged" (Fosdick). 

The locomotive, the automobile, and the flying machine are" un- 
answerable arguments in favor of prohibition. And now that men and 
women, boys and girls, are at the wheels of automobiles everywhere, 
wisdom dictates not only that prohibition must be continued but also 
that it must be enforced. 

WHAT PROHIBITION HAS ACCOMPLISHED 

Before prohibition men under the influence of liquor were tolerated. 
Today no intoxicated employee dare approach the flying field, the 
engineer's cab, or the chauffeur's seat, without being subject to dis- 
missal. Again, prohibition is a success. 

Before prohibition Chicago had a saloon for every 300 inhabitants. 
It is said that if every speak-easy, dive, or soft drink parlor dispensing- 
liquor in that city were counted today, the number would not be half 
so great. In our larger cities before prohibition, drunken men and 
drunken women were removed from lawns, they were seen frequently 
staggering along the streets. Such spectacles are unknown today. 
Prohibition is succeeding. 

Then, dives filled with drunken men were seen everywhere. Women 
and children, cold, naked, and hungry, congregated on the streets of 
our cities looking for husbands and fathers. There are no such spec- 
tacles today. By making liquor hard to get and by increasing its 
price, prohibition has protected these poor families so that in these 
days there are few mothers and children waiting in terror in a drunk- 
ard's home for the return of a drunken husband and father. Those 
who are using liquor now are the so-called "smart set." Fortunately, 
they are the non-rearing family class. Comparatively few of the chil- 
dren, therefore, are reared by parents who drink. Thus prohibition 
protects the poor and the lowly and those fine law-abiding Americans 
who are rearing families. 

"government control" 

Many honest, conscientious citizens stand today for the repeal of 
the Eighteenth Amendment. Most, if not all, of these favor "govern- 
ment control." 

Government control means that the people can get liquor without 
breaking the law; this will mean an increased consumption. In our 
automobiles haven't we drunken drivers enough already? The au- 
tomobile alone is reason enough for the strict enforcement of our pro- 
hibition laws. 

"You've been drinking. With you at the wheel I will not get 
into this car," said a mother as she and her fourteen-year-old daughter 
stood at the open door of an automobile. 

"Get in, get in, he has only had a taste," said a group of people who 
were standing about. 



36 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



The car hadn't traveled three miles on a downhill grade before it 
reached a curve and by the drunken driver was capsized. The child, 
who had been selected to deliver the address for her class at com- 
mencement, was killed, while the mother and other occupants of the 
car were seriously injured. I say again the automobile alone is reason 
enough for the retention and the strict enforcement of the prohibition 
law. 

Prohibition means efficiency. Prohibition means prosperity. Pro- 
hibition means doing away with drink-caused poverty. Prohibition 
means that there will be no children in the United States who cannot 
get training in the public schools. Prohibition will mean that the 
children of the United States, even the poorest, will be well clothed, 
well fed, well educated. Are not these arguments strong enough to 
justify the retention and enforcement of prohibition? 

A word more about government control. It is in operation in 
Canada. During the past summer I spent some weeks there going as 
far north as Winnipeg. From personal observation I concluded that 
conditions there, under government control, are much worse than con- 
ditions here under prohibition. 

TESTIMONY OF A CANADIAN 

Fearing that the information secured during my brief stay might 
not have led to a correct conclusion, I asked a practicing attorney 
who has been a citizen of Canada for some twenty or thirty years to 
tell me what he thinks of government control. 

"To my personal knowledge," began my able and experienced 
legal friend, "drinking increased immediately in every province." Do 
we desire to modify our laws, if after so doing, drinking is to increase 
immediately in every state and in every city? 

In 1927 six Canadian provinces spent $147,000,000 for liquor. 
In that same year alcohol in the Dominion held the sixth highest place 
among the imports of the nation. Under government control it ad- 
vanced to third place in 1928. During that time the value of alcohol 
imported increased beyond that for automobile parts, for raw sugar 
and for crude petroleum. Only two commodities, machinery and coal, 
exceeded in value that of imported alcohol. 

A FLOOD OF ALCOHOL 

Under government control, said the "Toronto Star" in 1927 : 

"A flood of alcohol continues to pour into Canada. During the fiscal year 
which ended in March, 1927, the Dominion imports of alcoholic beverages 
reached the value of $46,000,000 as compared with $19,000,000 in 1925. Including 
home production, the latest total would be close to $100,000,000." 

Do the citizens of the United States desire to have the amount of 
alcoholic liquor consumed increase at this same rapid rate? If such 
increase comes, imagine the peril that will exist for pedestrians with the 
whole country filled with drunken automobile drivers. 

During the four years following the adoption of government con- 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 



37 



trol, the province of Alberta, with a population of about 600,000, 
spent $42,000 ,000 for liquor. This amount would have paid the total 
expense of operating the provincial government for three years, it would 
have paid the total cost of all gasoline used in Alberta for three years, 
or it would have bought more than half the automobiles that are now 
in use in that Province. Are the people of the United States clamoring 
for a condition like this? Do the people of the United States desire 
to have our laboring men spend proportionately large sums for liquor, 
thus offering inducements to our laboring men to spend for liquor 
that money which is now being used to feed and clothe and educate 
their children and to provide comfortable homes for their wives and 
families ? 

This very day one of Salt Lake City's prominent citizens said he 
stands strongly for the repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment because 
it will do away with bootlegging. William R. Wood of Winnipeg 
says the brewers bootlegged 62% of all the beer they manufactured, 
and adds : "Illicit stills are found doing business on a gigantic scale 
after years of government control. Carloads of illicit liquor are still* 
intercepted on the railways." With the neighbor on our north involved 
in all these serious difficulties, are we going to follow in her footsteps 
and adopt government control? 

Mrs. Elizabeth Tilton says of conditions in Canada: 1. The 
government by putting its seal of approval upon drinking has almost 
annihilated the work of the church through years of teaching temper- 
ance and sobriety. 2. Bootlegging in Quebec is on the increase, and 
complaints of liquor law violation have almost trebled between 1922 
and 1925. 3. The number of government liquor shops increased from 
64 in 1922 to 90 in 1925. 4. Headlines in the Montreal Post during 
government control: "Montreal the Mecca for Crooks," and "A 
Veritable Avalanche of Outlawry, Hold-ups, and Robberies Has De- 
scended upon the City." 5. A mayor of Winnipeg : "While conditions 
under prohibition were bad, the present conditions are a thousand times 
worse." 6. Under government control the province of Quebec consumed 
in 1925, 27,397 more gallons of alcohol than in 1924. 

"Toronto Globe" : 

"If by success of government control we mean increased manufacture, 
increased facilities for the people to secure liquor, increased sales, increased 
consumption, increased drunkenness — then government control is a success. 

"If we mean decreased consumption and decreased drunkenness, if we 
mean reduction in bootlegging, blind piggeries and law breaking, then govern- 
ment control is a failure." 

IS LIQUOR NECESSARY? 

Invitations have been extended to economists of known standing 
throughout the country to write on the economic value of the use of 
liquor. No economist has been found who will speak or write on that 
side of the question. All economists agree that America sober has 
achieved things of which America drunk never could have dreamed. 

Some have argued that liquor is necessary in order to produce relax- 



38 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ation or rest from the prosaic dullness of the average life. In modern 
America the motor car, the movies, and the radio produce this relaxa- 
tion. These and prohibition have transformed conditions. Mass ex- 
istence is no longer the narrow, rum-ridden life of a generation ago. 

The automobile driver who is quite drunk is usually not dangerous 
because he is so easily detected or incapacitated, but the really dangerous 
driver is the man who has had one or two drinks only, who still thinks 
he is in possession of his faculties but whose driving judgment has been 
impaired. A moderate drinker, who slightly swerves in the wrong 
direction, may collide with any one of the 23,000,000 motor vehicles 
that crowd the nation's highways (Prohibition Still At Its Worst — 
Fisher, p. 340). 

When the Pennsylvania Railroad forbids its locomotive engineers 
to drink a drop even when off duty, ought not the American people, 
through legally authorized representatives, to forbid all automobile 
drivers to do the same? 

He who drives an engine has a steel track to steer his course. But 
he who drives an automobile has to steer his own course. Every 
car or pedestrian he passes is at his mercy. Each cross road is a grade 
crossing. Engineers are trained professionals. Many automobile 
drivers are amateurs. If private prohibition, applied to the professional 
on a perfected track is justified, surely government prohibition applied 
to the amateur on an unprotected track is more than justified. Pro- 
hibition applied to the automobile driver in America means prohibition 
applied to everybody. 

ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN 

Of the First Council of Seventy and 'President of the California Mission 

I am very happy, my brethren and sisters, in being present at this 
Conference, and feel, as no doubt you feel, that many very precious 
things have been presented for the consideration of the people who 
have assembled together. 

My mind is running upon matters pertaining to missionary work, 
that being my responsibility. I come up with greetings from the 
missionaries who labor in the California Mission, and I think I may 
be justified in saying that we feel considerably distressed in our feelings 
because of the tremendous reduction that has taken place in our numbers 
during the present year. It looks as though by the end of the year 
we will probably have a reduction of fifty per cent in the number of mis- 
sionaries in the California Mission. Fifty per cent less than January, 
1930. We have been in frequent correspondence with the presiding 
authorities of the Church about missionaries, until I have sometimes felt 
myself that when I would make reference to the need of the mission for 
an increased number of missionaries, it would not be very pleasant reading, 
because of it being so frequently repeated. 

I am conscious of the fact, my brethren and sisters, that financial 
conditions are not good. People are suffering from a lack of means, and 



ELDER JOSEPH W. McMURRIN 



39 



I am wondering if it is possible that any of the Ward and Stake 
authorities who make recommendations to the presiding authorities for 
missionary calls, feel there ought not to be the demand made upon 
the strength of Israel that has been made in the past, because of the 
depression that prevails throughout the land. 

Personally, I think there should be some steps taken in local 
communities to improve the conditions from a missionary point of 
view. Ordinarily, when a missionary is called to go out to preach 
the Gospel, the responsibility pertaining to his expenses rests altogether 
upon the parents or other near relatives. This should be changed. 
I entertain the thought that if a real effort were made in the local 
communities, through bishops, stake presidencies, and high councilmen, 
to interest all the people in the expense of the missionaries who represent 
them in the field, a great burden might be lifted from the shoulders of 
the fathers and the mothers who have representatives out in the world 
preaching the Gospel. This responsibility properly belongs to all the 
people. 

I do not understand that our obligations as members in the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have been removed or lessened 
because of the financial distresses that are in the land. We have, had 
quoted in our hearing the Scriptures, the inspired declarations of the 
prophets. One of those prophets, as we heard in the morning session, 
represented that the Lord God of heaven had said to him that he was 
a watchman upon the towers of Zion, and that his duty was to give warn- 
ing to the inhabitants of the land. If they hearkened they would be 
preserved. If they did not hearken they would be destroyed, but the 
watchman would have delivered his soul. Well, we need these watch- 
men that the people may be warned. That is my feeling. It is very 
strongly upon me. 

We have been laboring — I trust, with a fair amount of zeal through- 
out the California Mission — as watchmen. We have been trying to 
bring to the attention of the people the fact that we live in a marvelous 
age, and that as preachers of the Gospel we have been properly called 
by divine authority to cry repentance among the people. We have 
been trying to testify that we are not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ, 
that we know it is the power of God unto salvation, and that therein 
is the righteousness of God revealed, from faith to faith. We have 
been trying to impress the people with the thought that by this divine 
appointment we have been sent out to a perishing world, with the 
message of salvation ; and while the people have not flocked in very 
great numbers to listen to our declaration, some have paid attention, 
and there have been many investigators. Many of them may not be 
investigating with very great anxiety, but they have at least had their 
hearts so touched by the teachings and attitude and personality and spirit 
of the missionaries, that they are glad, in many cases, to receive them 
into their homes ; and some of them are inquiring for missionaries 
and we have none to send to them. 

In quite a number of instances, missionaries are laboring alone. 
That is not entirely in harmony with the counsels of the Church and 



40 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



with the rule that has prevailed quite largely in missionary work, but 
because of the reduction in our numbers, in an effort to hold the ground 
that has been won we have split up and divided our forces, in order 
that the word of the Lord, the Gospel of the Son of God, might be 
carried in some measure to the people who have been in the habit of 
coming in contact with representatives of the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints. 

I would like to humbly appeal to the men of the Church, in the 
communities of the Church where recommendations for missionaries 
originate, that after the call has been made by the presiding authorities 
of the Church, the whole community render financial assistance. I am 
quite confident when I say what I have said regarding the reduction 
of missionaries in the California Mission, that I represent the condition 
that prevails in all of the missions. 

I do not understand that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints has been relieved one whit from the carrying of the Gospel 
message to the inhabitants of the earth. Our Father in heaven declared, 
at the opening of this dispensation, that this message is to be taken to 
all the world. That is our responsibility, that we shall be found in 
the nations of the world, that we shall be crying repentance, that we 
shall be bearing witness to the restoration of the authority by which 
men minister in the name of the Son of God ; for we are in the same 
condition as were the disciples of old. Jesus taught them: "Ye have 
not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and have ordained you, and 
have sent you forth, that you might bring forth fruit." That is the 
condition of the missionaries. They have been selected from their 
fellow men, and by divine authority they have been commissioned to 
carry the message of the Gospel to the peoples in the missions to which 
they have been assigned ; and there surely is a crying demand for 
that service. 

I hope that proper local authority will be concerned in relation 
to this matter, that the hands of mission presidents may be strengthened, 
and that the opportunities that abound may be utilized, in the preaching 
of the word of God. 

I think I ought not to take more time, but I most earnestly make 
this plea. I am glad to say that although our numbers are smaller 
than they have been at any time during my presidency in the California 
Mission, we are nevertheless a happy company of men and women. 
We do believe in the Gospel that has been revealed through the Prophet 
Joseph Smith. We do believe that the promises of the prophets of old, 
in regard to the latter times, are having fulfilment ; and our hearts, 
as we endeavor to deliver this witness to the people, burn with joy 
within us, and you know the promise has been made by the Lord Jesus 
Christ that by that burning we should know concerning the truth of his 
work, and we have that burning in our souls and know the truth has 
been revealed. 

We want help, that we may deliver the message that has been 
committed into our hands. May there be ways and means found to 
give the help, I humbly pray in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 



ELDER ELIAS S. WOODRUFF

ELDER ELIAS S. WOODRUFF 

President of the W estern States Mission 

It is a very great pleasure to return and associate with friends 
and with Latter-day Saints in our Conference, and I sincerely trust 
that while I occupy this position the Lord will bless me as he has done 
my brethren. 

President McMurrin has uttered the thoughts, the hopes, and the 
desires of every mission president, I am sure. It has been a matter 
of great concern to each of us to see our missionary numbers dwindle 
as they have within the last eight or nine months. It has been a 
difficult matter to so dispose of our missionaries as to take care of the 
various fields of labor in which their services are required. It has been 
necessary and essential that we get local elders to help us, as far as we 
possibly can. I am aware of the fact that in securing the help of 
these local brethren and sisters we are merely adding to the faith and 
integrity of our own people, and adding to their ability to assist us at 
all times in the future; and perhaps in that respect the dearth of mis- 
sionaries may have had a compensating effect. But there is a great 
need for missionaries to carry the word, to spread our literature, to 
bear their testimony to the people; and there are many people who 
seem to be willing to at least listen. 

The power of the Lord is manifest in the missions. I know that 
in the Western States Mission we have had many favors at his hands. 
There have been some manifestations of his power that have thrilled 
and delighted us. 

I recently mentioned, in a report to my brethren, two important 
happenings. I think you might enjoy hearing of them. 

Over in Lincoln, Nebraska, a young missionary sister was dis- 
tributing tracts with her companion ; her companion on one side of 
the street, she on the other. She came to the door of a woman 
who invited her in, with the understanding that she would listen 
to her only while she continued her ironing. The woman said : 
"I am too busy to listen to you unless you talk to me while I 
iron." So the sister went in, took a chair and sat down. Pretty 
soon the ironing stopped. The woman pulled the plug out of the 
electric iron, stood the iron on its end, drew up a chair, and sat down 
in front of our missionary sister, and said to her: "What is there about 
you that is different from any one I ever saw before?" This sister, 
of course, was unable to answer her, for she was not aware of any 
difference. The woman said: 'Why, you are surrounded by a halo 
of light. I have never seen that before in my life." So our young 
missionary sister tried to explain to her that sometimes the Lord's 
blessings were manifest, and the Holy Spirit which surrounded his 
servants might be seen by those who had the gift of seeing. She was 
so interested and so astonished that after a little while, hearing in the 
conversation something about our Primaries, she asked Sister Good- 
liffe: "What is the Primary?" Sister Goodliffe explained to her what 



42 



GENERAL , CONFERENCE 



our Primaries are. The woman said: "I am the mother of nine 
children. Will you hold a Primary in my home?" So today, once a 
week, the two sisters in Lincoln, Nebraska, go to this good woman's 
home, and they hold a Primary with her children and the neighbors' 
children that are invited in. 

We have been so short of missionaries that it became necessary 
to take the sister missionaries out of Council Bluffs. We had the 
spectacle or the experience of a pair of elders holding six Primaries 
every week, in place of the sisters. One would smile, perhaps, to think 
of that, and yet they have been quite successful in their efforts to tell 
stories and entertain the children after the manner of Primary teaching. 
We are hoping that we may soon have two sisters that we can send back 
in there to continue that work. They do it so much better than the 
elders. 

Upon another occasion, speaking of the power of the Lord and 
the manifestation of his goodness, two elders in northern New Mexico, 
while going through the country for the purpose of visiting the scattered 
Saints, came into a community where two or three families of Saints 
resided, and began to administer the ordinance of baptism for their 
children. One little fellow who applied for baptism was nine years 
of age. He had been crippled from his infancy with an affliction 
in his knee of such a character that whenever his knee was placed 
in cold water he suffered excruciating pain. His mother said : "No ; 
no, you can't be baptized. You couldn't stand it." But the little 
fellow pleaded. He wanted to be baptized. The elders were asked : 
"Shall we baptize him?" and of course they hardly knew what to say. 
They naturally left the matter to the parents. Upon the earnest plead- 
ing of the boy he was permitted to enter the cold river water, for 
baptism, and to their astonishment there was no pain, and the little 
fellow came forth from the water rejoicing. Afterwards the elders 
laid their hands upon him, and invoked the blessings of the Lord upon 
him, and went their way. In three weeks time, on their way back to 
their quarters, they passed through this section of country, and naturally 
went to the home to see how the little boy was. When they arrived 
he was not in the house. The mother, replying to their inquiry as to 
his whereabouts, said : "He is out on the hill, looking for the cattle." 
The little fellow had been healed and was able to walk. Never before, 
in his life, had he been able to do so without pain or distress. 

One of these two elders, at a recent conference held in Alamosa, 
Colorado, stood before the congregation to address them, and there was 
a manifestation of the power of the Lord upon him, so that he was 
lifted up beyond himself, and I have never heard any one speak better 
than he did that night. We knew that the power of the Lord was 
with him, but only one person in the congregation was conscious of 
an unusual manifestation. At the close of the meeting a little girl, less 
than fourteen years of age, came to the presiding elder and said : "All 
the while that Elder Tenney spoke there was a beautiful personage 
clothed in white standing to the right of him, and this personage's 



ELDER ELI AS S. WOODRUFF 



43 



countenance was beautiful to behold. When Elder Tenney closed his 
remarks, he disappeared." We were naturally delighted and happy 
to know that the witness of the Holy Ghost and the power of the Lord 
do accompany the labors of our brethren and sisters. 

I am sure that these manifestations are occurring everywhere, 
merely a sign of the favor of our Father to his servants. 

It is a glorious privilege, my brethren and sisters, to be within 
the influence of such spiritual manifestations and blessings, and I 
count it not only an honor, but a joy and privilege to be thus favored. 
I am enjoying my labors. I have pleasure in reporting to you that 
all the missionaries, with one exception who are laboring in the Western 
States Mission at the present time, are quite well, and the one who is 
ill is recovering. 

May the Lord bless you. May he bless you in your basket and 
in your store, that you will listen and heed the appeal that has been 
made to send us more missionaries, so that we can carry on the work 
of the Lord. This is my humble prayer, and I ask it in the name of 
Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

, liberty's perfect law 

The Gospel of Christ is the Perfect Law of Liberty. So says 
James the Apostle. But liberty does not mean license, nor does the 
Gospel stand for antiquated tradition or for present-day speculation, 
religious or irreligious. It embraces all truth, whether in science, 
philosophy, art, or any other department of knowledge. God himself 
is its Author, its Fountainhead, and divine revelation is the channel 
through which it flows. 

■ - PURPOSE OF THE GOSPEL 

The Gospel is a great system of laws, a code of eternal principles, 
whereby the omnipotent and all-wise Creator, our Father in Heaven, 
proposes to lift fallen mankind, his sons and daughters, and not only 
save them, but exalt them to his glorious presence, and so far as they 
prove worthy and capable, share with them the empire of the universe. 

NO TYRANNY 

Freedom is the Gospel's sign manual. Tyranny has no place 
therein. There is no room in all the Government of God for the 
exercise of unrighteous dominion. 

ETERNITY'S CONSTITUTION 

The God we worship is no respecter of persons, but He is a 
respecter of men's rights, and a guardian of them — a fact clearly shown 
in the heaven-inspired Constitution of our country, and in the Gospel 
itself, which might be termed the Constitution of Eternity.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



A FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE 

Man's free agency, his right to worship as his conscience dictates, 
and to act in all things willingly and without compulsion — a principle 
handed down from the eternal past, where Lucifer was overthrown 
for seeking to destroy it — is an integral part of Liberty's Perfect Law. 
As such it found expression, a concrete illustration, and that by direct, 
divine command, when this Church was organized, one hundred years 
ago. 

THE CONSENT OF THE GOVERNED 

"Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the 
governed." So says the Declaration of American Independence, and 
so says, in effect, the Gospel of Jesus Christ. The doctrine of common 
consent has been practiced in this Church from the beginning, and is 
shown forth in all the conferences and other important gatherings of 
the Lord's people. They are clearly within their rights when they 
vote for or against the officers nominated to preside over them, and 
when they approve or disapprove of any proposed measure vitally 
affecting their spiritual and temporal welfare. 

JOSEPH AND OLIVER 

The men who organized this Church, or who were most conspicuous 
in its organization, were Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery. Joseph 
had looked upon the face of God ; had gazed upon the Father and .the 
Son; had received from them instructions concerning the then existing 
churches, from which he was commanded to hold himself aloof, and 
await the coming of the true Church, which was about to reappear, and 
in the establishment of which he was to be the chief human instrument. 
Oliver had been with Joseph in the work of translating the Book of 
Mormon, assisting him as copyist or scribe. He had shared with 
the Prophet the honor of receiving the restored priesthoods — the 
Aaronic and the Melchizedek; the former under the hands of John 
the Baptist, the latter by the subsequent personal ministration of the 
Apostles, Peter, James and John. The foremost of these heavenly 
messengers, John the Baptist, had told Joseph and Oliver that they 
were to be, respectively, the First and Second Elders of the Church ; 
and had directed them to baptize each other as a preliminary to other 
important proceedings soon to follow. 

In the first, second and third chapters of the History of the Church, 
Volume One — Joseph Smith's autobiography — the Prophet tells his 
own story of these wonderful events ; and they are also recorded in a 
more recently published Church History — the splendid product of the 
able pen of President B. H. Roberts. 

AN AMERICAN CHURCH 

Speaking of the word of the Lord that came to him and his co- 
laborer in the farmhouse of Peter Whitmer, Sr., at Fayette, Seneca 
County, N. Y., a word directing them to ordain each other to the office 
of Elder, the Prophet says : 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY 45 



"We were, however, commanded to defer this our ordination until such 
time as it should be practicable to have our brethren, who had been and who 
should be baptized, assembled together, when we must have their sanction to 
our thus proceeding to ordain each other, and have them decide by vote whether 
they were willing to accept us as spiritual teachers, or not." 

An American Church, truly, manifesting at the very hour of its 
birth the sublime democratic doctrine : "Governments derive their 
just powers from the consent of the governed." And truly did Joseph 
Smith, God's prophet, show himself a real and true American when, 
at a later period, in answer to a question put to him, as to how he 
managed to govern a community made up of so many different nation- 
alities, with all their varied languages, customs and traditions, he re- 
plied : "I teach them correct principles, and they govern themselves." 

GOD AND THE PEOPLE 

Let it not be supposed, however, that this recognition of "govern- 
ment of the people, by the people, for the people" — as Lincoln expressed 
it — shuts God out of the question. It may do so in the mind of a 
godless politician, or a pseudo, make-believe Christian, but not in the 
mind of a true Latter-day Saint or a Christian of genuine stamp. The 
United States is a republic, in which the people are looked upon as 
the one source of political power. The Church of Christ is a theo- 
democracy, in which God speaks and the people say amen ! It is the 
Church of God and his people, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints. , 

Obedient to the divine mandate spoken to them in Father Whitmer's 
humble home, Joseph and Oliver took steps to ascertain whether or 
not their brethren would sanction their ordination as Elders of the 
Church and were willing to come under their spiritual tutelage. 

NOT YET QUALIFIED 

What ! — exclaims one. After these men had communed with 
heavenly beings and received from them commandments for their 
guidance; after receiving divine authority to preach the Gospel, ad- 
minister its ordinances, and establish once more on earth the long 
absent Church of Christ ! After all this must they go before the people 
and ask their consent to organize them and preside over them as a 
religious body ? Yes, that was precisely the situation. Notwithstanding 
all those glorious manifestations, they were not yet fully qualified to hold 
the high positions unto which they had been divinely called. One 
element was lacking — the consent of the people. Until that consent was 
given, there could be no church with these people as its members and 
those men as its presiding authorities. The Great Ruler of all never 
did and never will foist upon any of his people, in branch, ward, stake 
or Church capacity, a presiding officer whom they are not willing to 
accept and uphold. 

Happily for all concerned, the brethren associated with Joseph 
and Oliver on that memorable sixth of April of the year 1830, did 



46 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



sanction their ordination, did "decide by vote" to accept them as their 
"spiritual teachers." 

GOD THE GIVER 

But suppose it had been otherwise. Suppose the brethren in 
question had not been willing to accept the men whom the Lord had 
chosen, but had lifted their hands against instead of for them. What 
would have been the result? Would such action have taken from 
Joseph and Oliver their Priesthood or their gifts and powers as seers, 
prophets and revelators of the Most High? No. Any more than it would 
have blotted out the fact that Joseph had seen God, and that he and 
Oliver had communed with angels sent from Heaven to ordain them. 
Their brethren had not given them the Priesthood, had not made them 
prophets and seers, and they would have remained such regardless 
of any adverse action on the part of their associates. The Gospel, the 
Priesthood, the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven are not within the 
gift of the membership of the Church. They are bestowed by the Head 
of the Church, Jesus Christ, in person or by proxy, and without his 
consent no power on earth or under the earth could take them away. 

WHAT MIGHT HAVE RESULTED 

But if the vote had been unfavorable, this would have resulted: 
The brethren and sisters who were waiting to be admitted into the 
Church would have closed the door in their own faces, would have 
cut themselves off from a most precious privilege, would have deprived 
themselves of the inestimable benefits flowing from the exercise of the 
gifts and powers possessed by the men divinely commissioned to 
inaugurate this great Latter-day Work; and they could have gone 
elsewhere, and, under divine direction, have organized the Church 
of Christ among any people worthy to constitute its membership 
and willing that these men should be their leaders. But the vote was 
in their favor, thank the Lord ! and we who are here today are among 
the beneficiaries of that act of faith and humility. 

A DIVINE NECESSITY 

Never, since this Church was organized, has it been without a 
divinely inspired Priesthood, with seers, prophets and revelators at 
its head ; and it never will be without them. They are a divine necessity. 
Wanting such guides, such pilots, inspired from above, we would be 
floundering in the same troubled sea of doubt and uncertainty respect- 
ing religion, its sacred obligations and its vital problems, as are the 
peoples of the world around us. Without the gift of the Holy Ghost, 
to interpret the Scriptures and make manifest the things of God, we 
also would be putting our own private interpretations upon the revela- 
tions of divine truth, and be lost and wandering, as others are, in a maze 
of superstition and error. 

LONGING FOR LIGHT 

The churches of men are built upon books and traditions, handed 



ELDER ORSON F. WHITNEY 



47 



down from the dubious past — what God said to other peoples in other 
times, under circumstances vastly different from our own. And mixed 
with these things are other things that God is said to have said — but 
never did say — and they are palmed upon the world as utterances of 
divine authority. In many lands God's children, millions of them, are 
yearning and longing for the Light, hungering and thirsting for pure 
Gospel truth, which they find not in man-made religions and philoso- 
phies ; and blind leaders of the blind, turning their backs upon New 
Revelation, are endeavoring to feed a spiritually starving world with 
the mutilated menu card of a banquet ages old. 

POWER OF THE PRIESTHOOD 

No book, however good ; no tradition, however venerable, is a 
sufficient guide for a progressive people on their way to the Celestial 
Kingdom. We have something better than books — far better than 
the best of them. We have divine authority, which constitutes the 
men holding it agents and representatives of the Almighty ; and what- 
soever they do by virtue of that authority, and under the inspiration 
of the spirit of their holy calling, is just as valid and binding and 
just as acceptable to God, as though he were present in person saying 
and doing what his servants say and do for him. That is what it means 
to bear the Priesthood. 

THE PURE FAITH 

We have the pure, primitive Christian Faith, and the spirit that 
interprets its sacred mysteries. Without that Spirit no man, whatever 
his intelligence, whatever his education and culture, can comprehend 
the Gospel or know Him whom to know is life eternal. 

god's work and glory 

This Church is not the work of man. Had it been man's creation 
it would have succumbed long ago to the assaults made upon it by the 
adversary of souls. It is not built upon the sand of ancient tradition 
or of modern theorization. It is founded upon the rock — Divine Revela- 
tion — God's gracious will and the glad consent of his people. There- 
fore is it destined to endure and to withstand every shock. The hosts 
of evil may hurl themselves against it, but they cannot prevail against 
it, nor shake the firm foundation upon which it stands as immovable 
and immutable as the throne of Him who sitteth in the midst of Eternity, 
and. who has said in words that can never die : "My work and my 
glory is to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man !" Amen. 

The hymn, "O Ye Mountains High," was sung by the congregation. 
The closing prayer was offered by Elder Joseph Christenson. 

Conference adjourned until 10 o'clock Saturday morning. 



SECOND DAY 



MORNING MEETING 

Conference reconvened Saturday morning, October 4, 1930, at 
10 o'clock, with President Heber J. Grant presiding. 

As an opening number the congregation sang the hymn, "Come, 
Come. Ye Saints." 

Prayer was offered by Elder David I. Stoddard, President of the 
Union Stake. 

The congregation then sang the hymn, "O Say, What is Truth?" 

ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

Ninety-nine years ago, about a year after the Church was organized, 
among other instructions that the Lord gave to his prophet for the 
guidance and comfort of the Church, were these words, found in the 
sixty-fourth Section of the Book of Doctrine and Covenants : 

"Wherefore, be not weary in well-doing, for ye are laying the foundation 
of a great work. And out of small things proceedeth that which is great." 

THE FOUNDATION OF A GREAT WORK 

Later in the same revelation : 

"For, behold, I say unto you that Zion shall flourish, and the glory of the 
Lord shall be upon her. 

"And she shall be an ensign unto the people, and there shall come unto her 
out of every -nation under heaven. 

"And the day shall come when the nations of the earth shall tremble because 
of her, and shall fear because of her terrible ones. The Lord hath spoken it." 

As we listened to the review, as given by the President yesterday 
morning, of the changed conditions that have occurred in the attitude 
of the world toward the Church, and as we see the hundred years of 
progress that has been made, we have every reason to believe that the 
Lord is fulfilling these wonderful promises ; that insignificant as was the 
beginning, those words of promise are fulfilled; that they were laying 
the foundation of a mighty work, and that out of small things great 
things will proceed. Evidence of that is clearly shown in the- ac- 
complishments of the past. 

AN ENSIGN UNTO THE PEOPLE 

But this promise goes farther than the foundation — it extends into 
the future, for "Zion shall arise and flourish, and the glory of the Lord 
shall be upon her; and people shall come from every nation." They 
have come from every nation. How could the prophet know, except 
he were inspired of the Lord, that this gospel message would touch 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 



49 



the hearts of the children of men in all nations? They have fulfilled 
that prediction, and here they are assembled ; and now comes a new 
charge to the Church : This Church "shall be an ensign unto the people." 

My brethren and sisters, as we look at the future there seems 
very clearly, to me, in the Lord's program a definite purpose, that his 
work shall arise and shine. This is an age that is full of theories. 
Many churches have solutions for the present problems. There are 
many societies and organizations being promoted in the world for the 
solution of our present troubles among the nations, and dealing with 
individuals. 

TRUE CHRISTIANITY"' S OPPORTUNITY 

It does seem to me that after these many years we have come 
to the place where we have an opportunity to be heard, and the world 
is willing to listen, and prejudice is so far removed that they are 
willing to give credit where credit is due. We have been more or less 
contending, for these hundred years, for the right to exist, to be heard 
and understood, and yet we have been drilling ; we have been rehearsing. 
We are ready to come on the scene in a great drama, to demonstrate 
before the world that there is virility and strength and power in the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ to solve the problems of the world. 

For all these centuries Christianity has been in the world, and 
has been helpless, very largely, to solve these problems, until the skeptic 
has concluded there is no power in Christianity, there is no virtue in 
the Gospel of Christ to solve these difficult problems that bring war 
and bloodshed and wickedness among men. 

The Latter-day Saints recognize that there has been, during all 
these ages, some little truth, and many honest souls have struggled 
towards the light ; but the world has been in a state of apostasy. The 
power of the Gospel has not been among men. The form of it, yes. 
So that true Christianity has not had a real test. It has not had a 
chance to demonstrate what it really could and will do. 

POWER TO SOLVE THE WORLD'S PROBLEMS 

This Church was established for the express purpose of proving 
to the world that there is power in the Gospel of Jesus Christ, power 
to solve the problems of the world, power to change the hearts of men, 
and bring to a distressed world its golden age, its peace, its prosperity, 
and its happiness. The dream that Daniel saw is to be realized, when 
the God of heaven is to establish a work that shall stand forever and 
fill the whole earth. 

The prediction of the modern prophets has been to the effect that 
this was but the beginning of that great movement, and now that we 
are being given the opportunity to be heard, now is the time for the 
Latter-day Saints to rally to their standards, and demonstrate to a 
world that is in doubt and uncertainty, and full of skepticism, that 
there is power in the Gospel of Jesus Christ to change the hearts and 
the lives of men, and to influence the destinies of the nations towards 
that dream tof the prophets of the past that a golden age would come, 



50 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



when all the distresses that have afflicted men would pass, and universal 
brotherhood would come, and peace be in the world. 

Let me just touch one or two of the problems that this Gospel is 
solving and can solve — setting a pattern for the world. 

THE LORD'S PLAN FOR HELPING THE POOR 

Here is the problem of the world's poor. The Lord's plan for its 
solution, without humiliation to the poor, and a blessing to those who 
offer relief — the fast offerings given by the membership of the Church 
once a month, following abstinence from food for two meals. Fasting is 
a blessing in itself to the physical being, and a blessing to the spiritual 
being, because it tends, in its very nature, to give spiritual control oyer 
the physical being. Gratitude for the goodness of the Lord in providing 
food and life comes from that fast, also sympathy for the poor who are 
without food, and then too we are giving that which has been saved. 

I know that there are many who do not seem to clearly understand 
what ought to be given — the equivalent of the meals saved. I should 
say that certainly ten cents a meal would be the minimum, or twenty 
cents per individual, per month. I wish that were the standard main- 
tained by the membership of the Church. It is not up to that point, 
but even as well as the Latter-day Saints are performing that service, 
it is creating a large fund, and if we would observe it strictly it would 
create ample funds to care for the needs of the poor, and industrialize 
them. 

The method of the Lord's plan is excellent, the giving to the bishop, 
who distributes to the poor. It is not my business to give to the poor. It 
is the business, in the Lord's Church, of the bishop to give. I give to 
the bishop, and he dispenses to the poor. Those who receive it do not 
know from whence it comes, and those who give it do not know to 
whom it goes. That is not letting your right hand know what your left 
hand is doing. I know of no other scheme by which the Lord's plan 
could be carried out better than that established in this Church. This 
plan would perpetually solve the problem of the poor, and I say in- 
dustrialize them and make them independent economically. 

The Lord's plan does not contemplate the pauperization of the 
poor. I remember my father being a bishop for forty years, and it was 
my privilege, as a boy, to carry the charities to the poor of, that ward. 
I was impressed, when I went to the home of a widow who needed 
help, and found her knitting stockings ; and when I went to a poor man 
who needed help, I discovered he was cutting the widow's wood, while 
she knitted stockings for the poor man who needed help. Everybody 
was encouraged to do something to help somebody else, even though 
they received charities. 

I am told that on the tithing yard here east of us, when there 
wasn't work for worthy poor, there was a pile of rocks in one corner 
of that yard, that the worker that wanted a job was set to carry into 
another corner of the yard, and he received his pay at the end of the day. 
If on the following day there was a worthy applicant, but no work for 
hitn, he might be given the task of carrying the rocks back into the 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 



51 



original corner, and he came to get his pay at night with the feeling that 
he had earned it. 

That is the spirit of industrialization among the poor of the Church 
that has been with us from the beginning, and is to be carried on. 

A SOLUTION FOR CAPITAL AND LABOR PROBLEMS 

The problem that exists in the world between capital and labor 
can be solved in the Lord's plan of tithing. The struggle for the 
maintenance of one class over another is not the Lord's way of solving 
this problem. Let me read to you, from the fifty-sixth Section of the 
Book of Doctrine and Covenants, what the Lord himself has to say 
upon this subject : 

"Woe unto you rich men, that will not give your substance to the poor, for 
your riches will canker your souls ; and this shall be your lamentation in the 
day of visitation, and of judgment, and of indignation — the harvest is past, the 
summer is ended, and my soul is not saved ! 

"Woe unto you poor men, whose hearts are not broken, whose spirits are not 
contrite, and whose bellies are not satisfied, and whose hands are not stayed 
from laying hold upon other men's goods, whose eyes are full of greediness, who 
will not labor with your own hands ! 

"But blessed are the poor" — yes, and the Lord could have added, blessed 
are the rich — '"whose hearts arc broken, and whose spirits are contrite, for they 
shall see the kingdom of God coming in power and great glory unto their 
deliverance." 

The deliverance of the poor shall not be through any legislation. 
It will come through the Lord's plan, for they shall see the power of 
God coming in glory unto their deliverance, for the fatness of the earth 
shall be theirs. 

"For behold, the Lord shall come, and his recompense shall be with him, 
and he shall reward every man, and the poor shall rejoice. 

"And their generations shall inherit the earth from generation to generation, 
forever and ever." 

That is the plan that will succeed. Neither in the control of the 
affairs of the iworld by the rich, nor by the poor as in Russia ; neither 
element will succeed, from its own selfish point of view, but they must 
be brought together in the spirit of brotherhood, in the spirit of union 
of interest, and that will never be accomplished, only under the Lord's 
plan. Tithing is the first step toward that plan, where both the rich 
and the poor contribute according to their means, for the common 
welfare of each. There is no pew in this Church for the rich to sit in, and 
denied to the poor ; no blessings extended to the wealthy in the temples 
of God, and denied to the poor. They share alike, and the rich man 
gets no more than the poor man. Tithing the Lord designated as a 
schoolmaster in this Church to bring us to the more perfect order of 
things that obtained in the days of Enoch, and every man that will come 
into the celestial kingdom of God will have to learn the lesson, to live 
not only under the schoolmaster, but ultimately to come to the United 
Order, or the Order of Enoch, wherein there shall be community of 
interest, and yet individual responsibility and opportunity, but such 



52 



GENERAL , CONFERENCE 



combination as will eliminate jealousy and hatred and envy in the hearts 
of men. 

This Church is a hundred years nearer the solution of that problem 
than any other community in the world, and the Latter-day Saints 
should rally to the law of tithing and be prepared in time to demonstrate 
before the world the real genuine solution of this question. 

A STANDARD FOR THE PERFECTION OF MEN'S LIVES 

So with the Wlord of Wisdom, dealing with the perfection of 
men's lives by living up to a Gospel standard. Oh, it may be true 
that we do not maintain the prohibition law that has been enacted 
into the Constitution, but I hope it shall be preserved. If we abandon 
it we shall see worse times than we are seeing today. I believe that 
if this nation could persevere under the prohibition law for twenty-fjve 
years, we would raise a generation of men and women that would 
easily subscribe to that law, and that problem would be solved. But 
if this nation is not able to do that, and shall return to the old con- 
ditions, what of us? 

The Lord gave to this Church a plan that will succeed when all 
the schemes of men shall fail. I recognize that you cannot legislate men 
into righteous living. That must come from the heart. Our plan 
contemplates the conversion of the hearts of men to an obedience to 
the Lord's plan, and to the strict observance of that revelation that 
enjoins upon us the obligation not only to refrain from the use of 
liquor, but from tea and coffee and tobacco, that are injurious to the 
physical being. 

The Lord knew the needs of this fast-moving age, that we need 
the power that comes from observing the Word of Wisdom, if we shall 
endure under these strenuous conditions that are around us. Now 
is the opportunity for the Latter-day Saints to rally to that standard, 
and demonstrate, though the world may fail, through its legislation 
to correct this evil, that we will correct it by the conversion of men, and 
demonstrate the way for the world to follow after in the solution of 
that problem. 

FOR THE ESTABLISHING OF PEACE 

So with all the other problems. In this Gospel is the plan and the 
way by which peace can come, and war be abolished. If every 
person in the world had in his heart today the spirit that is in 
the hearts of these Latter-day Saints, you would not need a League 
of Nations, you would not need a court to limit armaments. It would 
be solved, because into the hearts of these Latter-day Saints has come 
the power of God, the gift and power of the Holy Ghost, that takes 
envy and malice and hatred out of the heart, and puts the love of 
men there. You could not think of one stake of Zion going to war 
with another. No. Although they come from the ends of the earth, 
the men of all nations live here in peace and in love. If that spirit 
could be extended to the ends of the earth, our problems would be solved. 

Now is the opportunity for the Latter-day Saints to arise and shine. 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 



53 



As we enter into this second great period of the Church's history an 
opportunity comes to us, since we have the stage, and since the people 
of the world are willing to listen and give credit. Now is the time for 
us to rally to our standards and demonstrate the power there is in the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ. 

God help us to see our opportunity and embrace it, and carry for- 
ward gloriously the Lord's purposes, until his work shall be consum- 
mated and become the glory of the earth, I pray, in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

Anticipating an invitation to speak during this Conference, and 
realizing that the speakers would be heard by a large number of people 
outside of this building, I prepared some notes that I might speak from, 
but I don't know that I shall use them. 

GRATITUDE FOE BLESSINGS OF LORD 

I want to say to the brethren and sisters that I am very happy 
in my membership in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 
and in the blessings of the Gospel which I enjoy in common with you. 
I am happy in your fellowship and association, and in the work that 
I have been honored to do in this Church. 

The Lord has been good to us as a people, and he has been good 
to me as an individual. As I look back over my life and its experiences, 
I can see where the Lord has held me by the hand, as it were, and led 
me along the path of duty, shielding me from evil and wickedness 
that I might have indulged in to my everlasting sorrow and condem- 
nation. I feel that it is as little as I can do to seek to know what the 
will of my Father in heaven is concerning me, and to> do his will to the 
best of my ability. I believe that every member of this Church should 
feel the same. If we turn our thoughts back over our past lives, I 
feel sure that all of us will have occasion to rejoice in the fatherly 
care that has been given us, and the many blessings that have been 
showered upon us. 

TESTIMONY REGARDING THIS WORK 

I have passed the period of question or doubt, which comes into 
the lives of many people, and I do know of a surety, and have proven 
over and over again from the scriptures and by the application of 
reason and good sense, to my perfect satisfaction, that this work is 
true, so that I have no fear of any man being able to disprove it. 
I have lived the Gospel, in part, at least, so as to have the witness 
of the Spirit of God, and I do know, by the power of the Holy Ghost, 
that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God, and the Redeemer 
and 'Savior of this world. 



54 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



I know that our Father in heaven lives, a glorified and immortal 
being, with all power — power to bless and power to save. And I 
know that this work is true, that in it is the saving power of God to 
those who will accept and obey it. I know, by sense of reason, that 
he who was the instrument in the hands of God in restoring this Gospel 
to earth, must have been and is a prophet of God. 

NOT ACCEPTED IN THEIR OWN DAY 

It is hard for the people of this day and time to accept Joseph 
Smith as a Prophet of God. It was ever so that the prophets were 
not generally accepted by the people of their time. The Scriptures 
relate that when Jesus was preaching in the synagogue in his own 
country, the people were astonished, and said : 

"Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works? 

"Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his 
brethren, James and Joses, and Simon, and Judas ? 

"And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this man 
all these things? 

"And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is 
not without honor, save in his own country, and in his own house. 

I have often wished that he had added, which I think he could 
have done with equal truth, "save in the day and time in which he lived." 

"And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief." (Matt. 
13:54-58.) 

I firmly believe that the time will come when all men, as universally 
as they accept Jesus Christ to be the Savior of the world, will acknowl- 
edge Joseph Smith to have been a great prophet of God in these last 
days, in the dispensation of the fulness of times. 

Brethren and sisters, that which I feel and know to be true, I 
believe that you, also, who are living your religion, feel and know to 
be true, by the same means. 

THE FAITH OF OUR FATHERS 

An impressive thought came to me this morning while we were 
singing the hymn, "Come, Come, Ye Saints." 

"We'll find the place which God for us prepared, 

Far away in the West ; 
Where none shall come to hurt or make afraid — 
There the Saints will be blessed. * * * 

"And should we die before our journey's through, 

Happy day ! all is well ! 
We then are free from toil and sorrow too; 

With the just we shall dwell." 

These words express the feeling of our pioneer fathers and 
mothers in their deep trial when their faces were turned, as it were, 
from civilization toward the great unexplored West, bringing with 
them practically nothing but the Gospel, which was the dearest thing 
they had on earth ; and with the hope that the Lord would inspire his 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS S5 

leaders that they might find a place of refuge, safety and liberty, 
where they could worship the Lord according to the dictates of their 
consciences. They endured much sorrow and tribulation, and many 
died in the effort to make for us what we have here today. 

OUR OBLIGATION 

.We are their successors in this work. We have inherited the 
blessings that they finally were able to enjoy. We are indebted to this 
work for all that we have, all that we hope to obtain. Are we going 
to carry on the work as faithfully and devotedly as did our pioneer 
parents, or are we lying down on the job? Are we fainting by the 
way? Or are we living our religion, and by so doing setting an 
example to the world worthy of their emulation, such as will cause 
them to glorify our Father in heaven by an investigation of that which 
has made us what we are, that is commendable, and perchance, by 
their embracing the Gospel and engaging with us in the furtherance of 
the Lord's work? 

Do we ever consider that we are under obligation to our fellow 
men, that we are under obligation to the Church, as well as to our- 
selves? Do we consider that we are under obligation to our fathers 
and our mothers, who have suffered and endured so much for us? 
If we will not live our religion for our own soul's salvation, then 
we ought to do so for the sake of others, including our children, and 
our children's children who are coming after us. 

PERTAINING TO OUR KINDRED DEAD 

We have a responsibility pertaining to our kindred dead. The 
Prophet Joseph tells us, and it is on record, that the greatest responsi- 
bility that God has laid upon us is that of looking after our kindred 
dead. Until the Church was organized, and there were temples built, 
and an opportunity for the living to do something for the dead, there 
seemed to be no occasion for our forebears to look to us. There was 
nothing we could do for them. But with the introduction of the 
Gospel, and the building of temples, the Lord sent his servant, Elijah, 
as predicted by Malachi he would do, who conferred the keys upon 
Joseph and Oliver of the turning of the hearts of the fathers to the 
children, and the hearts of the children to the fathers. From that 
day, the 3rd of April, 1836, when in the Kirtland temple that wonderful 
manifestation was had, there has been a spirit and a desire among the 
children of men on the earth, not only those in the Church, but those 
outside as well, to know of their kindred dead. Men and women of 
education and wealth are expending their fortunes and their time in the 
search for knowledge of a genealogical character, and in the printing of 
histories of their families. Governments have made provision for the 
keeping of records, just such statistics as we need in order to perform 
this temple work for our dead. Genealogical libraries have been estab- 
lished all through the land, and these family histories, and other gen- 
ealogical information, are accessible to the Latter-day Saints. 

The Lord is using those who are not of us in the furtherance of 



56 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



his purposes and in helping us, that we may more fully do our duty 
by our kindred dead. 

SERVING A TWO-FOLD PURPOSE 

Are we making use of this information, and are we going into 
the temples of the Lord to do this work? Or if we are not able our- 
selves to go, are we expending some of our means in the employment 
of others to go through the temple for our dead? 

All the ordinances administered in the temples are performed with- 
out any charge to the individual. Those who come there can attend to 
those labors without any charge whatever. If you cannot come it will 
be necessary for you, in the endowment work of the temple, to have 
some one represent you. 

In these temples we have some of our aged pioneers who have 
worn themselves out, as it were, in helping to make this country in- 
habitable, beautiful and prosperous as we find it today. Their bodies 
are broken but their spirits are alive and awake as much as ever, and 
they find in the temples a work that they can do just as well as can 
younger people, who are more vigorous in a physical way. Some of 
these people have nothing to live upon except the mere pittance which 
is given them in compensation for the work they do for others in the 
temples. If you cannot go to the temple yourselves, send to the temple 
a little money with a record of your dead and these good people will do 
the work for you, and you will not only be redeeming your kindred 
dead but you will by so doing be helping to support the worthy poor 
of the Church. We had a letter come to us a few days ago from a man 
here in the city who is interested in genealogical and temple work, 
and he suggested that in these times, when there are so many of our 
people out of employment, men who are worthy to go to the temple, 
it would be an opportune time to make known to the people of 
this Church that if they would furnish some means now to get their 
temple work done, these unemployed people would receive a great 
blessing in being employed to do that work. That, I think, is a sug- 
gestion worthy of consideration, as we are looking about us for some- 
thing to do to alleviate this distressing condition of the unemployed. 

ACCORDING TO OUR KNOWLEDGE 

Brethren and sisters, are we living our religion to the best of our 
knowledge? I want to say to you that no man can be saved in the 
kingdom of God without knowledge, knowledge of the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ, of the way of salvation, and no man can be condemned without 
a knowledge of this Gospel. The Lord has made provision that every 
child of his that comes to maturity in life shall hear and have the 
privilege of accepting the Gospel either here or hereafter. When the 
ordinance work is done for those who died without a knowledge of 
the Gospel, it becomes effective for their salvation upon their ac- 
ceptance of it. 

Are we, brethren and sisters, who know the truth, living according 
to the light which we have received, so as to not fall under condemna- 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 



57 



tion? I think I can promise the Latter-day Saints, in truth, and in the 
name of the Lord, if you, my brethren and sisters, will live up to the 
light of the Gospel as you have received it, you will obtain a salvation 
in the kingdom of God. If you shall be disappointed and condemned 
in the end it will be because you have not lived up to the light and 
knowledge which you have of the Gospel. I wonder if our Father in 
heaven is going to be disappointed in some of us, his children, when 
we return, having had the opportunities the Gospel has afforded us* 
here in life. I wonder if we will be disappointed in ourselves, if our 
parents will be disappointed in us, or our children who come after us. 

This is something, brethren and sisters, that I think we should 
consider most seriously. Our time is brief at longest here in which to 
prepare for the life which is to come. Wle cannot afford to waste our 
time. We cannot afford to trifle with sacred things and sacred duties. 
The sin of neglect is unjustifiable. "He that knoweth to do good 
and doeth it not is in sin before the Lord, and he that knoweth to do 
right and doeth it not is in sin." 

OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO TEACH OTHERS 

Our obligation is not only to ourselves but to our fellow men here 
in the world. We mustn't overlook that. If we be not called to go 
abroad and preach the Gospel, there is plenty for us to do at home. 
The spirit of this work is, every man to his neighbor ; he that is warned, 
to warn his neighbor. Our responsibility to teach the Gospel to others 
is set forth in Ezekiel, 3rd Chapter, 2'0th verse: 

"When a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness, and commit 
iniquity, and I lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die: because thou hast 
not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he 
hath done shall not be remembered ; but his blood will I require at thine hand." 

Every man and woman that in sincerity has received the Gospel 
was at the time of entering the Church a righteous man or woman. 
Have we held them in righteousness? 

The ministry of the Church at home has a responsibility of com- 
pleting the conversion and holding these men and women. Are we 
doing it in an organized way, as effectively as we can? Are we, as 
individuals, doing our part to our neighbors within the Church? If 
we see men and women neglecting their duties in the Church and we 
know that they are in danger of losing that which would be more 
precious to them than life, do we give them a note of warning in the 
spirit of kindness and brotherly love, and reach out a hand to help them, 
and bring them back and put them in the way of religious duty? Are 
we doing our full duty by our fellow men? 

Brethren and sisters, these are questions that we may well ask 
ourselves, and then answer them to our satisfaction, by living up to our 
obligations and to the light and knowledge of the Gospel which we 
have. 

We cannot accomplish this alone, but if we seek the Lord with 
desire in our hearts to live our religion, and to do his will, he will 



58 



GENERAL i CONFERENCE 



help us so that we will be able to come off victorious, conquerors of 
ourselves, conquerors of evil, devoted adherents and advocates of the 
truth of God. May he so bless us and save us in his kingdom, I pray, 
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

At the request of President Grant the congregation arose and 
sang, "God Moves in a Mysterious Way." 

ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL 

Of the First Council of Seventy 

I intend to be reminiscent in what I shall say on this occasion. 

I have frequently called your attention to the fact that under 
President John Taylor I was permitted to fill a mission in the Southern 
States, in 1883 and '84, under the presidency of Elder B. H. Roberts. 
They were trying times, and the elders, as a whole, traveled without 
purse and without scrip. 

In 1892 I was again appointed, under President Wilford Woodruff, 
to preside over the Southern States Mission. It was during that period 
of time that I found God; as my father said: God answered my prayers, 
and isn't that a pretty good evidence that God lives? My testimony 
was fixed and fast, and what I knew I learned by obedience and through 
suffering. 

I take the position that knowledge cannot be knowledge without 
experience, so that what I know through the influence of the Holy 
Ghost — for I have heard that still, small voice — I know to my perfect 
satisfaction. There is no question of a doubt in my mind as to the 
truth of this work, and any time in my life that I can be convinced that 
Joseph Smith was not a prophet of God, then I will question the truth 
of this work. But Joseph Smith to me is a prophet, and there is hardly 
a Kimball living in the flesh today — of the first generation — notwith- 
standing we were very young when our father died, that did not have 
burned into his soul as a child that Joseph Smith was a prophet of the 
living God: that Brigham Young was his successor; that he too was 
a great prophet. 

Now, it is along that line that I desire to occupy your time for a 
few moments, and to do so I expect to forecast from dead prophets. 
I shall not undertake to quote from memory as it is very difficult 
for me to quote correctly. 

The prophet Joel said — we elders in that day on many occasions 
quoted this prophetic saying: 

"And it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out ray Spirit upon all 
flesh ; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy ; your old men shall 
dream dreams ; your young men shall see visions." 

I think one of the greatest pieces of philosophy in the Bible is: 
"Where there is no vision the people perish." And the Prophet Joseph 
Smith left with us this statement : "Where there are no gifts there is 
no faith." 



ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL 59 
I further read in the Bible : 

"When a prophet speaks in the name of the Lord, if the thing follow not 
nor come to pass, that is the thing which the Lord hath not spoken ; but the 
prophet has spoken presumptuously, Thou shalt not be afraid of him." 

Jesus himself testified that "a prophet hath no honor in his own 
country." 

I claim not to be a prophet, but I am a son of a prophet, and I 
expect to give you evidence — whether you question the truth of it or 
not — that shall be left with you — that Heber C. Kimball was a prophet 
of God. President Brigham Young on more than one occasion said : 
"Heber is my prophet, and I love to hear him prophesy." 

In May, 1868 — that is sixty-two years ago — he said: 

"After a while the gentiles will gather in Salt Lake City by the thousands, 
and this will be among the wicked cities of the world,." 

He said : 

"A spirit of speculation and extravagance will take possession of the Saints, 
and the results will be financial bondage." 

He said : 

"An army of elders will be sent to the four quarters of the earth, to search 
out the righteous and warn the wicked of coming events. 

"All kinds of religions will be started, and miracles performed that will 
deceive the very elect, if such a thing were possible. 

"Persecution comes next, and all Latter-day Saints will be tested to the 
limit. 

"Many will apostatize, and others will stand still, not knowing what to do. 

"Before the temple reaches the square our brethren will be imprisoned, until 
the penitentiary shall be full, and some of them will be removed to other 
penitentiaries. 

"Mothers would weep for their husbands, and children would cry for their 
fathers. Some would die, and sorrow would fill the hearts of the Latter-day 
Saints. 

"When the temple roof is on, the persecution will lessen, but when the 
temple is completed the power of the Evil One will be shut out." 

"The prayers of the Saints will then be heard. The sick will be taken there 
and healed." 

"The Spirit of God will rest upon the people, and work for the dead will be 
continued night and day." 

"The judgments of God will be poured out upon the wicked, to the extent 
that our elders from far and near will be called home ; or in other words, the 
Gospel will be taken from the gentiles, and later on will be carried to the Jews." 

"The western boundaries of the State of Missouri will be swept so clean of 
its inhabitants that as President Young tells us, 'when we return to that place 
there will not be as much as a yellow dog to wag his tail.' 

"Before that day comes, however, the Saints will be put to the test that 
will try the very best of them. 

"The pressure will become so great that the righteous among us will cry 
unto the Lord day and night until deliverance comes." 

In 1856— that is seventy-four years ago — a small group of friends 
convened in the house of the Lord, called the Endowment House. The 
conversation was about the isolated condition of the Latter-day Saints.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



"Yes," said Brother Heber, "we think we are secure here in the chambers of 
these everlasting hills, where we can close the doors of the canyons against mobs 
and persecutors, the wicked and the vile, who have always beset us with violence 
and robbery, but I want to say to you, my brethren, the time is coming when 
we will be mixed up in these now peaceful valleys to that extent that it will be 
difficult to tell the face of a Saint from the face of an enemy against the people 
of God." 

"Then is the time to look out for the great sieve, for there will be a great 
sifting time, and many will fall. 

"For I say unto you there is a test, a Test, a TEST coming." 

He further said: 

'This Church has before it many close places through which it will have to 
pass before the work of God is crowned with glory. 

"The difficulties will be of such a character that the man or woman who 
does not possess a personal knowledge or witness will fall. If you have not 
got this testimony, you must live right and call upon the Lord, and cease not 
until you obtain it. 

"Remember these sayings : The time will come when no man or woman will 
be able to endure on borrowed light. Each will have to be guided by the light 
within themselves. If you do not have the knowledge that Jesus is the Christ, 
how can you stand?" 

Do you believe it? 

President George Q. Cannon said, after Heber C. Kimball's death : 

"Heber Chase Kimball was one of the greatest men of this age." 

He continued : "No man, perhaps, Joseph Smith excepted, who has 
belonged to the Church in this generation, ever possessed the gift of 
prophecy to a greater degree than he." 

On the morning of the 22nd of June, 1868, he died. 

At the funeral President Brigham Young said: "Heber was a 
man of as much integrity, I presume, as any man who ever lived on the 
earth — a man of faith — a man of benevolence — a man of truth." 

On the evening of January 12th, 1862, the Lord made it known to 
Heber C. Kimball that he should not be removed from his place as 
First Counselor while he lived in the flesh. 

Now my brethren and sisters, I am here to testify that the spirit 
of prophecy is in this Church. Any man who has a testimony that 
Jesus is the Christ has the spirit of prophecy, and I know that we have 
living prophets. Whenever the Lord desires, and it is his will to speak 
through his prophets, I have no fear and no doubt as far as I am 
individually concerned that they have the courage and the faith to speak 
the words of God. At a time when the people were suffering, when the 
people were almost naked, when everything looked desolate, as if they 
were forsaken — 

"Heber C. Kimball, filled with the spirit of prophecy in a public meeting 
declared to the astonished congregation that within a short time States goods 
would be sold in the city of Great Salt Lake cheaper than in New York and 
that the people would be abundantly supplied with food and clothing." 

" T don't believe a word of it,' said Apostle Charles C. Rich ; and he voiced 
the sentiment of nine-tenths of those who had heard the astounding declaration." 

"On resuming his seat he remarked to the brethren that he was afraid he 
had missed it this time. But they were not his own words and He who had 
inspired them knew how to fulfil. The occasion for the fulfilment of this 



ELDER J. GOLDEN KIMBALL

remarkable prediction was the unexpected advent of the gold-hunters on their 
way to California. The discovery of gold in that land had set on fire, as it were, 
the civilized world and hundreds of richly laden trains now began pouring across 
the continent on their way to the new Eldorado. Salt Lake valley became the 
resting place. Thus as the Prophet Heber had predicted, States Goods were 
actually sold in the streets of Great Salt Lake City cheaper than they could 
have been purchased in the city of New York." 

Now, brethren, that is how I feel about it. I take pride in being 
a son of my father and as long as I live I shall never fail to honor my 
father and his successors, and try to be as loyal and true and steadfast in 
the faith as they have been. I am the only one that can destroy my 
faith in this work. God bless you. Amen. 

ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 

First Counselor in the Presiding Bishopric 
After one hundred years, and then what? 

During the past year we have been dwelling largely in the past, and 
it seems to me that when we look upon the work of our fathers, our 
mothers, our grandfathers and grandmothers, and view their great ac- 
complishments, there can be no question that this Church has grown 
in a wonderful manner. No organization could make such a growth 
other than through the help, inspiration and leadership of an all-wise 
Father. As I view these accomplishments I wonder if we are not, to a 
certain extent, living now too much in the past, and not enough upon the 
past, for the experiences and accomplishments of the past should be a 
tower of strength to urge us on to greater individual effort. 

I heard a brother who was preaching a sermon on tithing say that 
his father overpaid his tithing and some of his children were drawing 
on it to this day. Surely such action cannot be considered as a growth. 
How can we use the past to help us build for the future? Truly they 
showed the way. Are we doing our part to carry on? If so, there 
need be very little concern for the future. If we have a clear picture 
of the struggles of the past one hundred years, and understand the 
principles that made it possible for them to build such a foundation, we 
should go on with a sincere desire to build for our future welfare and 
salvation. 

One of the writers in the Book of Mormon tells us: 

"For behold, this life is the time for men to prepare to meet God ; yea, behold 
the day of this life is the day for men to perform their labors. And now, as 
I said unto you before, as ye have had so many witnesses, therefore, I beseech 
of you that ye do not procrastinate the day of your repentance until the end ; for 
after this day of life, which is given us to prepare for eternity, behold, if we 
do not improve our time while in this life, then cometh the night of darkness 
wherein there can be no labor performed. Ye cannot say, when ye are brought 
to that awful crisis, that I will repent, that I will return to my God. Nay, ye 
cannot say this; for that same spirit which doth possess your bodies at the time 
that ye go out of this life, that same spirit will have power to possess your 
body in that eternal world. For behold, if ye have procrastinated the day 



62 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



of your repentance even until death, behold, ye have become subjected to the 
spirit of the devil, and he doth seal you his ; therefore, the Spirit of the Lord 
hath withdrawn from you, and hath no place in you, and the devil hath all 
power over you; and this is the final state of the wicked." 

And so I say we should be gravely concerned with today. If so, 
tomorrow will take care of itself , and the work entrusted to us will be 
nobly done, and our reward assured. 

Brother McMurrin made a plea for more missionaries. Our 
mission presidents are constantly doing that. There isn't a month that 
their reports do not contain pleas for more help. It is marvelous what 
this people are doing, many even sacrificing the comforts of life to 
provide for their children who are engaged in missionary work, but how 
many make an equal effort to prepare them for this service before they 
leave for the mission field. I am sure better preparation which must 
come through active service will go a long way to meet the demands 
made upon us. 

Yesterday, sitting in a group in this tabernacle, we had eighty- 
seven young men and women who next week will leave for the mission 
field. They are young and inexperienced. They have a testimony of 
the Gospel, but they are not altogether sure of themselves at the present 
time. They are anxious to be engaged in a good cause. Last night at 
seven o'clock I met with them, this being the last period of their day's 
work. Their first class yesterday was at nine o'clock in the morning. 
They were excused at nine forty-five and came here in a body to attend 
this Conference. They were here in the afternoon, and went from that 
meeting to another class ; had a luncheon period, and then to another 
class. At the close of their class at eight o'clock last night I asked 
them to select a song to close, for we always begin and close our day's 
work with song and prayer. The song first suggested seemed to me, 
for the moment, a bit of irony. It was announced as "Do not weary- 
by the way." As we sang the song, I stood facing that group. I 
tried to detect such a feeling on their part. I found everyone singing — 
not just the words, for all were singing as we can sing only when 
touched by the Spirit of God. When the prayer of dismissal had been 
offered after nine hours of religious service, these young people, whom 
you have sent from your homes to go into the mission field, gathered 
around me with more questions, untiring in their effort to gain more 
information. 

We shall not be greatly concerned for them while they are in the 
mission field, for they are going out with a purpose, and God is with 
them and watching over them, and will hear and answer their prayers 
and our prayers in their behalf, and as long as they continue in that 
service in faith, his blessings will rest upon them, and they will return 
home to bear testimony of his goodness, and to the truth of the Gospel. 

Then is the time when we should be gravely concerned for them, 
for we find many times these young missionaries come home and find 
themselves in the condition, in a measure, that the Savior found him- 
self in, as related to us by Brother Richards today. Speaking of Jesus : 



ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 



63 



"And when he was come unto his own country, he taught them in their 
synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, whence hath this 
man this wisdom, and these mighty works ? Is not this the carpenter's son ? 
is not his mother called Mary? and his hrethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, 
and Judas? And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this 
man all these things? And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto 
them, A prophet is not without honor, save in his own country, and in his 
own house. And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief." 

Let us compare the faith of these, his own people, with the faith 
of one who was despised by the Jews. 

''So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. 
And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum. When 
he heard that Jesus was come out of Judea into Galilee, he went unto him, 
and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son : for he was 
at the point of death. Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and 
wonders, ye will not believe. The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down 
ere my child die. Jesus saith unto him Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the 
man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way. 
And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him, saying, 
Thy son liveth. Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. 
And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him. 
So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which Jesus said 
unto him, Thy son liveth : and himself believed, and his whole house." 

I am wondering if in Israel today we are not lacking just a little 
bit in faith. During the last summer we received many reports saying : 
"We have been unable to do anything with our priesthood work. It 
is vacation period, and everybody feels that they should have a vacation 
from church work." 

I do not feel to criticize any who have a desire to take a vacation, 
for a change and rest is necessary at times, but even then they must 
have food if their physical welfare is to be preserved. But I have 
yet to find a good reason for taking a vacation from spiritual work, 
and from that association which comes to those who are humbly seeking 
spiritual food. On the contrary, as I view the situation, I find that those 
who feel that it is necessary to take a vacation from church work seem 
to forget that spiritual food is necessary to preserve the spiritual body 
and without it the spiritual body begins to die for lack of nourishment. 
That death may come slowly or, if sin overtake them, it may come quick- 
ly, and I believe one of the greatest dangers that we have confronting 
us is the sin of indifference which surely leads to spiritual death. 

There is no time for vacation in this service. God is working 
constantly. He requires that his children upon whom the priesthood 
has been conferred labor in spirit constantly, for the spirit of God will 
not always strive with man. We cannot lay this work aside and take 
it up as we feel inclined, for if we hope to succeed we must work daily, 
hourly and every minute. We must so live that these temples which 
God 'has given to us and which we call our physical being will be kept 
clean and a fit dwelling place for his spirit. That can best be done 
through associations provided through our gatherings, such as priest- 
hood and sacramental meetings where spiritual uplift is engaged in.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



This condition is manifest in our missionaries who, after having de- 
voted all of their time to the spiritual, come home strong in spirit. 

We should be concerned for these young people who return from 
the mission field, because I find, or I think I find that sometimes we 
do not have a full sense of responsibility regarding their future welfare. 
It can be pictured to you in this statement. I heard a father say to his 
boy, who had just returned from the mission field : "Come on now, 
son, get off your good clothes and get into your old ones and get to 
work. You have been loafing long enough." 

Most of them don't loaf in the mission field, but we force them 
to loaf sometimes when they come home, because we fail to feed them, 
to give them that spiritual food that kept them active while in the mis- 
sion field. And so they die spiritually, and we wonder why. Don't 
blame them. It isn't their fault. It isn't their choosing. They would 
have it otherwise. 

Now, what of the future? I must not talk longer, but let me give 
just a little illustration that perhaps will show you what can be done. 
After the close of the past year, when bishops were sending their annual 
reports to the Presiding Bishop's Office, one bishop came with his, and 
as he turned to leave the office, he waved his hand to me. I returned his 
salute and beckoned him to come into the side office where I was, for he 
had a broad smile on his face and seemed unusually happy. He stepped 
to the door, and stated that he had no desire to disturb me. He just 
wanted to say "hello." I suggested that he seemed happy and asked 
how he managed to get that way, for it is unusual to find a bishop in 
that frame of mind at that time of the year. He answered that he was 
happy because the people over whom he was presiding were helping 
him. He stated that he had been bishop two years. He said : 

"When I started in to get acquainted with the people of my ward I found 
it was very difficult to make much headway with the older people. They were 
fixed in their habits. They were doing some church work, but not much. Most 
of them were willing to let someone else do the work. Their activity record 
was on a par with their spiritual condition. We decided to take up a labor with 
the younger people. We reorganized the Aaronic Priesthood quorums, conferred 
with those who were active, and they helped us outline a campaign to encourage 
greater activity. We sent them out to bring in those who were inactive. They 
responded with such a spirit of good will that soon every boy who held the 
Aaronic Priesthood was in attendance at meetings. We decided to take up 
as our first major activity a campaign for the year on tithing. Our first duty 
was to convert ourselves. Every phase of the subject was discussed. All agreed 
to work with a desire to have every person holding the Aaronic Priesthood a full 
tithepayer. We gave quorums credits based on numbers. Some complained 
that we were bribing them, in offering credits for the payment of tithing, but 
nevertheless it was a means of encouraging them. They brought in their five 
cents, their ten cents, their twenty cents each week as they earned money. After 
a while the parents gave more thought to their tithing, and last year t when I 
came in with my tithing settlement, we had double the tithing of the year before 
and more than double the number of active members, due largely to the activity 
of these young men whom we taught to observe this principle. And this year 
we have increased the tithing of our ward just as much as we increased it 
last year and the ward members are responding to every call, and that is why 
I am happy to come in here with my final report."

I could mention many such experiences. 

My brethren and sisters, what of tomorrow? Tomorrow may 
never come, to some of us ; but may the blessings of God rest upon 
us today, that we may be touched with the power and influence of his 
Holy Spirit. May we have power to see clearly the purpose of this great 
work; may we see clearly the niche in which we belong, that we may 
fit in and do that which is required of us to the best of our ability, for 
there is work for all to do. We belong to the most wonderful organiza- 
tion in all the world. Men are called to positions of responsibility, 
and after a time are released, and take their places in the ranks that 
others may gain experience through leadership. There are no hard 
feelings, jealousy, or contention, for men serve wherever they are called 
to serve. They do not seek honor, and serve with fear and trembling, 
happy to be engaged in such a noble cause. 

May we continue in that spirit. May we have love in our hearts 
for each other. May we work for each other, and to the end that God's 
purposes shall be brought about, and when the time comes for us to 
lay down the part we are called to play, I sincerely trust it will be said 
of us: "Well done, thou good and faithful servant. Enter into my 
rest." May God bless us, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

I trust that the few moments I occupy I may enjoy the Spirit that 
comes from our Heavenly Father, that gives to us power to think, to 
reason, and to teach. 

This Conference has been one of great interest to me. My mind 
has been directed toward so many things that pertain to our work. I 
have been making notes during the entire period of our meetings, 
up to now, notes that I trust I may use to refresh my mind when I 
am in the conferences of the Church, because very many times a sug- 
gestion or an idea directs to a portion of the scripture, and when we 
read it it sounds a little different from what we thought it did, because 
it has been a long time since we read it, perhaps. 

A BLESSED PEOPLE 

We are a blessed people. I know of no other people in the world 
who have more reason to be grateful than we. We have all that the 
world has in the way of information, education, culture, refinement ; 
and besides that we have an understanding of the purpose of life: 
we have the privilege of being identified with the Church of the Lamb 
of God. 

We are wonderfully blessed in the assurance that the Lord gives 
to us of eternal life, and when we compare the information that we 
have obtained with that which many of our Father's children in the 
world have, we are made to realize that much will be expected of us, 
because unto us much has been given.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



It is unique these days to belong to a church, wherein those who 
are members believe that the Lord speaks through their leaders. When 
we are instructed by the President of this Church, we believe he 
tells us what the Lord would have us do. To us it is something" more 
than just the advice of man. We believe that, and it searches our souls, 
and we are prompted to renew our determination to be what God would 
have us be. 

I have rejoiced in the fine testimonies that have been borne, in 
the instructions that we have received. I have had pleasure in shaking 
hands with many of my brethren and sisters here. These things give 
me joy, and help to make my life worth living. 

While Brother Kimball was speaking of the prophecies of his 
father, I thought how many men there have been in this Church who 
have listened to the voices of the prophets of God, and who have lived 
to see the fulfilment of those prophecies. No other organization that 
I know of, in the world, lays claim to any such gifts or blessings. 

INVESTIGATORS IN THE MISSIONS 

I have just returned from the Northern States Mission where I 
had the pleasure of visiting a number of our larger branches. The 
development there is very pleasing to me. I have never been in the 
Northern States before when we had so many comfortable chapels as 
we have now that have been dedicated to the Lord, and I have never 
been there before when there was as great a percentage of investigators 
in the congregations as at this time. 

The people of the world are becoming alarmed, but the alarm is 
only just beginning. Unless the men and women of this nation, and 
of all nations, turn unto the Lord and keep his commandments, they 
cannot hope to continue in his favor ; and if his favor is removed from 
them, then the adversary will do his work. I rejoiced in my visit in 
the East, to find so many people investigating the Gospel, people who 
after meeting would say : "I have never attended one of your churches 
before, but I thought I would like to come, and have enjoyed the 
service." I have in mind a woman and her husband, who came up 
after the meeting in Detroit. They had never before attended a Latter- 
day Saint meeting. This woman was delighted to find that there were 
people on the earth who believe as we do. She listened to the humble 
missionaries bear their testimony and preach the Gospel, not with great 
learning, but with the power that is more potent than university training, 
the witness of our Heavenly Father that they spoke the truth. 

We cannot hope to convince the world of the truth of the Gospel 
if we depend upon the book-learning that we obtain in schools, but 
we can obtain all that they possess, and then if the Lord continues to 
bless us we can go on, reaching higher points, understanding greater 
things that are not understood except by the power of the Lord. 

THE PARABLE OF THE WEDDING FEAST 

I have opened to the twenty-second chapter of St. Matthew's 
account of the Savior's teaching, and will read this particular parable : 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 



67 



"And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and said, 
"The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made a marriage 
for his son, 

"And sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding : 
and they would not come. 

"Again he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which are bidden, 
Behold, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and 
all things are ready: come unto the marriage. 

"But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his farm, another 
to his merchandise : 

"And the remnant took his servants, and entreated them spitefully, and slew 
them. 

"But when the king heard thereof, he was wroth : and he sent forth his 
armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city. 

"Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they which were 
bidden were not worthy. 

"Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall' find, b|id 
to the marriage. 

"So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as 
many as they found, both bad and good : and the wedding was furnished' with 
guests. 

"And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which 
had not on a wedding garment : 

"And he saith unto him, Friend, how earnest thou in hither, not having a 
wedding garment? And he was speechless. 

"Then saith the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take 
him away, and cast him into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and 
gnashing of teeth. 

"For many are called, but few are chosen." 

OUR MINISTRY 

How much this is like the world today ! God has restored his 
Gospel. He has sent his servants into the world. They have called 
all men to repentance, as far as they could reach them ; have not reviled 
them or been unkind, but have invited them to come into the wedding 
feast that the Lord has prepared, and in many cases they have been 
ignored. People have been too busy to hear the message. The in- 
vitation meant nothing to them. They didn't believe in what was 
being done, and in some cases they have ill-treated those who had come 
to them in kindness and love. 

The Gospel of Jesus Christ is a gospel of peace. It is not a 
gospel of contention. We are instructed by the Savior to go into all 
the world and teach this Gospel unto every creature. That command- 
ment has been given to the Church in this day. We do not go out in 
our own name or in our own strength, but we offer to our Father's 
children these precious truths, that are essential for them to understand 
in order that they may gain the blessing that our Heavenly Father 
intends. 

Thousands of our sons have gone into the world. Many have been 
kindly received, and they have explained the truth, and this mission 
is still going forward. The feast has been prepared. Our Heavenly 
Father has provided what is necessary: it has not been done by the 
wisdom of man. He has sent us, his representatives, into the world, 
not to drive or coerce, but to invite. "Come follow me," is what the 



68 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Savior said, "And I will give you peace." That is what the Gospel 
teaches, and that is our ministry. 

WITHOUT A WEDDING GARMENT 

But I am thinking of another group. Here was a man who came 
into the wedding feast, and when the time came the king or the master 
saw that he didn't have a wedding garment on. He had ignored the 
importance of it, apparently. He had come in, not prepared, expecting 
to participate. He had come to the feast — they had all been bidden to 
the feast, but I assume that they were supposed to know that only 
those would be admitted who were properly clothed, and this man was 
amazed when the question was asked him why he was there in that 
condition. 

The world seems to think that they can come whenever they are 
ready. Our Father's children do not understand that there is some 
preparation to be made. The adversary has so deceived them as to make 
them believe that no preparation is necessary, anything will do, but 
in this message that the Savior gave in a parable to his associates we 
are informed that there must be some preparation, and without that 
preparation no one will be permitted to partake of the more precious 
gifts of our Heavenly Father. That applies to the membership of 
this Church who have an idea that because they have been invited, 
and because their names appear upon the record among those who have 
been called, there is nothing more for them to do ; men who have been 
blessed in a financial way ; women who have become prominent in social 
life. They have forgotten the Lord and are not preparing for the 
feast to which he has invited them. 

NECESSARY PREPARATION FOR THE FEAST 

Our Heavenly Father intends that we shall prepare for the wedding 
feast or we will be excluded. He expects us to continue to store our 
minds with the truth, and to disseminate that truth as opportunity 
offers among all his children. The fact that our names appear upon 
the Church records is no guarantee that we will find our place in the 
celestial kingdom. Only those who live worthy to be members of that 
kingdom shall find place there. 

In the midst of the unsettled condition, the uncertainty that is 
in the world, if there ever was a time when we should examine ourselves, 
to find out if we are doing what the Lord would have us do, it is today ; 
if there ever was a time when we should be sure that we are in the 
pathway of eternal life, it is now. We can't slight these opportunities. 
God will not be mocked. When he has offered to us a gift, when he has 
placed within our reach a blessing, when he has invited us to partake of 
a feast and we ignore it, we may be sure that we shall suffer the distress 
that will come to those who refuse the blessings of the Lord when 
they are offered. 

ONLY BY KEEPING THE COMMANDMENTS 

This is a good time for the membership of this Church to be 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 



69 



examples to all the world, for the humble among us to seek the Lord, 
and for those who lack humility to cultivate it. It has been made very 
plain to us, and there was no distinction made whether men were in the 
Church or out of it. It was the Savior who taught that, "Unless you 
are as humble as a little child ye shall not see the kingdom of God." 
We desire to see that kingdom, don't we? This group of men and 
women here today, who represent the Church, desire to see and to 
inherit the kingdom of our Lord, and there is only one way whereby we 
may obtain that priceless gift, and that is by keeping all the command- 
ments of our Heavenly Father. He does not differentiate ; he does not 
select any particular group of commandments ; but he teaches us that 
we must keep all of his commandments. 

I say that there is need in all Israel today — there is need for this 
man addressing you to examine himself — there is need for every one 
of us to look about ourselves and see wherein we are neglecting our 
privileges and our duty, for tomorrow may be too late. Today is the 
acceptable time of the Lord. Let us set our houses in order. Let us 
love one another. Let us sustain these men whom God has raised up 
to preside over us. Let us bless them, not only by our lips, but by 
assisting in every possible way to carry this burden that rests so heavily 
upon their shoulders. Let us honor these presidents of stakes and these 
bishops of wards. Pray for and bless them and help them. Let us 
love one another, that our Heavenly Father may be able to bless us, 
and he will bless us if we love one another and do good to all his 
children. 

TESTIMONY 

I know that God lives. I know that our Heavenly Father has 
spoken in this day and age of the world, that his Gospel is upon the 
earth, and while I would not compel any soul to accept it, I pray that 
we may have power and wisdom and strength to reach out after 
these neighbors of ours who do not understand the truth. Let us do 
our duty, and draw them into the fold of the Master, that they, with us, 
may know that he lives. 

Again, I bear my testimony that I know that Jesus is the Christ. 
I know that Joseph Smith was a prophet of the Lord. I know that 
the Gospel for which these gave their lives is the power of God unto 
salvation, and the only means whereby we shall obtain a place in his 
celestial kingdom. 

That we, with those we love, and as many as we can contact with 
and influence, may take advantage of our blessings, and accept the 
invitation to the marriage feast, and when we arrive there be properly 
clad, that we may go in thereat, that we may rejoice with those who 
have kept the commandments of God, and enjoy eternal life in his 
celestial kingdom, I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I failed to read one brief statement of statistics in my opening re- 
marks. There have been two changes in Stake Presidents : Elder David

Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock this afternoon. 

SECOND DAY 
AFTERNOON MEETING 

Conference was resumed at 2 p. m. 

The hymn, "Prayer is the Soul's Sincere Desire," was sung by 
the congregation. 

Elder Clarence E. (Smith, President of the Bear River Stake, 
offered the opening prayer. 

The congregation sang the hymn, "Redeemer of Israel." 

ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

"For behold, my soul delighteth in plainness unto my people, that they may 
learn." 

These kre the words of an ancient Hebrew prophet, addressed 



ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE 



71 



to the people whose leader he was, commissioned and appointed o'f 
God. 

The spirit of plainness has characterized the addresses of this 
conference so far, and if I speak plainly unto you at this time I 
trust you will understand that I speak under the same spirit that 
impelled Nephi in the utterance cited. 

WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH THE WORLD? 

We do not believe in treating ourselves with gratulation to the 
extent that we feel because we are the covenant people of God — ■ 
and we boldly proclaim this fact — that all is well with us and that we 
are right in the sight of God to the extent he would have us be. 
Gentle but firm admonishment has been given in earlier addresses. 
Well deserved commendations have been made of the good that our 
people have accomplished and are accomplishing, and the question of 
what is the matter with the world, which occasionally we see in bold 
headlines in newspapers and magazines, has been touched upon. 

The great trouble with the world today as I understand it is 
that it has become idolatrous. We read of idolatry and think of it as 
a practice or series of practices in the past. This is an idolatrous 
generation, defying the commandment written by the finger of God — 
"Thou shalt have no other gods before me," and an idolatrous gen- 
eration is an adulterous generation. 

IDOLATRY AND ADULTERY 

Have you never pondered over that remark of the Savior to those 
who came seeking a sign at his hand, when there were signs all 
about them? They had seen the sick healed, the lame made to walk, 
the deaf made to hear, the blind made to see, the dead raised to life, 
and still they came asking for a sign; and he answered them as be- 
fitted their hypocrisy: 

"An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign." 

I ask, have you ever considered the connection between the awful 
sin of adultery and that godlessness that made those curiosity-seekers 
come asking for a sign? The word "adultery" and the word "idolatry" 
were originally one, that is, they sprang from the same root, and mean 
essentially the condition of being false to a solemn covenant. 

The Lord compared himself — though in terms of rebuke — to the 
Israelites of old, as their husband. "I am married unto you," he said ; 
and further, in effect: "O recreant Judah, backsliding Israel. I am 
married unto you. I love you as a husband loves his wife, and yet 
you go after strange gods and desert me, with whom you have made 
covenant." 

LIVING SCRIPTURES 

That was adultery and idolatry, and such is characteristic of the 
world today. How far does it affect the Latter-day Saints? Let 
Vis consider later. But first I cite you to a bit of ancient scriptural 



71 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



history, and as introductory to such citation, I take the opportunity 
of saying that every dispensation of the Lord's dealings with mankind, 
from the Adamic down, has been characterized by living scriptures. 
The accumulated scriptures of earlier dispensations were quite essential 
to the people lest they would dwindle in unbelief. These ancient records 
are the world's treasures ; but ancient scripture is not enough. In 
every dispensation there have been oracles of God empowered to speak 
the will and the word of the Lord, and what they spoke became 
scripture, technically after it was written ; and these scriptures are 
preserved for our guidance. 

A BIT OF ANCIENT HISTORY 

Here is the historic instance I would cite to you. Call to mind 
the history of King Nebuchadnezzar, whom the Lord used as a scourge 
unto the covenant people because they had gone astray. Aye, because 
they had deserted him, their husband, and had fallen into the ways of 
idolatry and adultery, he sent Nebuchadnezzar to scourge them. The 
pagan king led Israel captive. He went so far as to take from the 
temple in Jerusalem the sacred vessels of gold and silver that has been 
used in the ceremonies- and ordinances of the holy house. Eventually 
Nebuchadnezzar was brought to see the power of God and rendered 
praise unto him. 

His successor, Belshazzar, referred to by historians as the son 
or the grandson of Nebuchadnezzar, was lifted up in the pride of his 
heart, and on the occasion of a great feast he called for the vessels that 
had been brought from the temple that he might display before his 
people his power and proclaim anew the captivity of Judah. 

You know the story. As he and his lords with their wives and 
concubines there in the court were drinking from those vessels, a 
mystic hand appeared, writing upon the wall. None of the king's 
sooth-sayers or wise men could interpret the writing. Belshazzar was 
greatly frightened. Then Daniel was called, he who had interpreted 
the dream of Nebuchadnezzar, and he spoke plainly, for his soul 
delighted in plainness. He recited the troubles that had come upon 
Nebuchadnezzar, and then added : 

"And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thine heart, though 
thou knewest all this ; 

"But hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven; and they have 
brought the vessels of his house before thee, and thou, and thy lords, thy wives, 
and thy concubines, have drunk wine in them ; and thou hast praised the gods 
of silver, and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, 
nor know : and the God in whose hand thy breath is, and whose are all !thy 
ways, hast thou not glorified." 

Then did he interpret the divinely cryptic writing, part of which 
interpretation made clear to Belshazzar that he had been weighed in 
the balance and found wanting, and his kingdom was to be taken 
from him. 



ELDER JAMES E. T AIM AGE 



73 



PRESENT DAY APPLICATION 

Ancient history, you say, yes but is it not applicable to conditions 
in the world today? Men are praising the gods of silver and of gold 
and of all the other valuable commodities that make up wealth, and 
the God in whose hand their breath is and whose are all their ways 
they will not recognize. Do you wonder that wickedness and crime 
have increased to terrifying proportions under those conditions? The 
prophets of old foresaw it. They spoke of the days of wickedness and 
vengeance immediately precedent to the second coming of the Lord, 
which I reiterate, for it has been spoken before, is near at hand. 

Now, O Israel, ye Latter-day Saints, how far do these conditions 
exist among us as a people, laying claim even to higher title than that 
of which Israel of old were so proud? There were certain signs by 
which that ancient people were known among their pagan contem- 
poraries. I mention three, as many as time will permit. 

SIGNS OF THE COVENANT PEOPLE 

The Israelites were distinguished in the first place as worshipers 
of a living God, -a personal God, in whose image they had been created 
and made. No other nation on the face of the earth recognized the 
living God. That was a sign by which the covenant people, descendants 
of Abraham, through Isaac and Jacob, were known. Another sign 
was this, they observed every seventh day as the Sabbath of the Lord 
their God ; and the Lord had said : This shall be a sign between thee 
and the nations : The}' shall know that ye are my people, because ye 
observe my Sabbaths. And the third sign I mention is that they were 
tithed of all they possessed. Those were set forth prominently as the 
banners of Israel, by which all nations should know that they were 
the covenant people of God. 

Now I repeat, in every dispensation living scriptures are given. 
The history of the past is of value, but the great principles are restated, 
the fundamental laws are reenacted. Christ came to fulfil and supersede 
the law of Moses, and yet with his own lips in the flesh he restated 
every commandment in the Decalog, giving it to the new dispensation. 
He cited prophecies of the past, connecting up the earlier dispensations 
with that in which he lived and at the head of which he stood in a 
particular sense, not only as the head of all dispensations, but in the 
sense of his being there in mortality. 

Where do we stand with respect to those signs ? Are we worship- 
ing the true and living God, or are we going idolatrously after the 
gods of gold and silver, of iron and wood, and brass, diamonds and 
other idols of wealth? Are we worshiping our farms, our cattle and 
sheep ? Who is our God ? To whom are we yielding homage, allegiance 
and worship? Not worship by means of words only, in ritualistic form, 
but worship in action, devotion, and sacrificial service? 

COMMENDATION AND ADMONITION 

I feel it is the duty of those who stand as your presiding servants 



74 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



and your leaders to call attention to the defects of the people as well 
as to praise their good deeds ; and I say that we are not fully living 
up to those signs characteristic of the Lord's covenant people. Where 
are you spending your Sabbaths? Are you tithed? No other people 
on the face of the earth is making such a record, and I believe no 
other people in past ages have made such a record as the Latter-day 
Saints are making, in the matter of the payment of tithes. But col- 
lectively we are about a fifty per cent tithe-paying people. Are we 
in the habit of leaving our tithing settlement until the end of the year 
and then making some donation or gift, calling it tithing, trifling with 
the word of God and his law? I doubt if there be one man in fifty, 
perhaps not one in a hundred, who leaves the payment of his tithing 
until the end of the year who pays a tithe. Unless he keeps his books 
with all the care that a bookkeeper in a great business corporation 
could give he does not know what he has to tithe. But the Lord would 
have you tithed as his people of old were tithed, paying when they 
received. 

I know that this people are the people of the Lord, that they are 
acceptable unto him, but we are not reaching fully the requirements 
that the Lord has made upon us ; and too many Latter-day Saints are go- 
ing after strange gods, setting their hearts on their hay and their corn, 
their bonds and stocks, their automobiles and the luxuries of the world, to 
the neglect of their duties in the Church. Though I would be no 
prophet of evil, of disaster, or of calamity, I feel to say that if the 
Latter-day Saints do not obey the law that God has given with respect 
to the tithes, they will have less and less to tithe, this in the Lord's 
own time. 

EXHORTATION TO GREATER EFFORT 

Let us lift the banners of Zion, the banner of the true worship 
of the living God, the banner of Sabbath observance, make it a holy 
day for the service of the Lord, not a day of idle rest and sleep and 
inactivity, but a day of activity in the Lord's important service. This 
he has required of us, and he never has modified the requirement by 
the slightest amendment. Keep flying the banner of the sacred tithe 
for the Lord. He would have his people tithed that the land may be 
sanctified unto them. It is for our good that the law of the tithe has 
been given. We cannot advance in the knowledge of God and the 
things pertaining to exaltation in the kingdom of God unless we have 
that training. 

I can join with full heart and soul with my brethren and sisters 
in that joyous hymn, "Zion prospers, all is well." But I remember 
also the words of the Lord given unto the Nephites of old : "Therefore, 
wo be unto him that is at ease in Zion ! Wo be unto him that crieth : 
All is well !" It depends upon how we say it and how we sing it. Zion 
is prospering and will continue to prosper in spite of you, my brother, 
you forty per cent Latter-day Saint; in spite of myself, whatever 
my rating may be, and I am trying to attain the one hundred per cent 



ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE 75 

standard. Zion will prosper in spite of me, if I am not faithful. But 
wo unto him who sits down in idle complacency, neglecting the com- 
mandments of God. 

I pray that we may be what we profess to be, in the name of 
Jesus Christ, Amen. 

PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAWSON 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

My brethren and sisters, man in his creation is a dual being. 
There is a spiritual side to his nature and there is a temporal side, and 
with respect to this matter I desire to give expression to the thought 
that is in my mind. 

THE DUAL NATURE OF MAN 

If you will pardon me for being personal, I will say that for the 
last seventy-three years I have been partaking of food, and every time 
I sit down to a meal of victuals, if I address myself to the occasion 
with a good appetite and the food is properly prepared, I enjoy it. 
It contributes to my body. It is pleasant, refreshing and healthful. 

Now, the elements that were in the food that I have partaken of 
are about the same, and yet when the food is prepared in a variety 
of different ways and made inviting to the taste it accomplishes the 
purpose. If I refrain from taking food into my mortal body, the body 
will die. 

What I have said of the body is equally applicable to the spirit. 
We come to meeting and sit down at the table of the Lord, so to speak, 
and partake of spiritual food. We have had a most wonderful spec- 
tacle in this General Conference. Yesterday the people assembled in 
great numbers and sat and listened with rapt attention to what was 
said. Why did they come to the meeting? They came in order to 
get spiritual food, and they appeared to enjoy it and to be well satisfied 
at the conclusion of the services. It almost appeared from their 
attitude that they were indeed perfectly satisfied and would require 
no more of such food. But here they are again today, the same people, 
with an appetite for more food to strengthen their spiritual natures. 

This seems wonderful to me, but it is comprehensible and it is true. 

THE GOSPEL EVERLASTING AND EVER-INTERESTING 

Now, with respect to the Gospel of Jesus Christ, we have been 
listening to the preaching of the Gospel for an hundred years. It has 
not changed in principle, or theory, or practice, one iota in all that 
period of time. We are led to believe, and we surely do believe, that 
it will never change. It is an everlasting Gospel, and yet when these 
glorious doctrines such as faith, repentance and baptism, the laying on 
of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost, and other principles of the 
Gospel — I say when they are presented to us from different viewpoints, 
combined with the particular characteristics of the speakers, their 



76 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



manner of delivery, etc., we become interested, and what we hear seems 
to be new to us and is acceptable and pleasant. And yet, as I have 
already said, there isn't any change at all in the scheme of salvation. 

It may be, my brethren and sisters, in my remarks this afternoon 
that I shall touch upon some principle or principles that have been 
emphasized in this Conference. If so, I hope to approach them at a 
little different angle from that which you have heard, so that you will 
not become weary and tired, but may be profited. 

A SACRED VOLUME OF SCRIPTURE 

I have in my hand the Pearl of Great Price, which is a sacred 
volume of scripture. It is one of the standard works of the Church, 
and in its teachings, it is in perfect harmony with the Holy Bible. 
The title page reads as follows: 

"The Pearl of Great Price — selections from the revelations, translations 
and narrations of Joseph Smith, the first prophet, seer and revelator to the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints." 

So, in part, what is found in this book, is a veritable pearl of 
great value. It was translated by Joseph Smith the Prophet from 
parchment, or papyrus, which came down from ancient times and was 
found enclosed with a mummy. It is a record which is well worth 
the careful attention of the world. 

AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT WORK 

In this book there is a sentence which has already been quoted 
in our Conference and which I am disposed to repeat, wherein the Lord 
says : 

"This is my work and my glory — to bring to pass the immortality and 
eternal life of man." 

Brother W hitney, I think, emphasized these words, and others have 
referred to them. Well, now, brethren and sisters, let me say to you 
that in my opinion the work thus referred to is the greatest and most 
important and most vital work in which God is engaged. Why is it 
so extremely important that he should bring to pass the immortality 
and eternal life of man? It is for this reason: God himself is eternal, 
God is the "Father of the spirits of all flesh." Our earthly parents 
furnish our bodies, and our Heavenly Parents furnish our spirits, and 
the spirit and the body joined together constitute the soul of man. 
Hence the children of men are living souls. It so appears from the 
very beginning, at the time of man's creation. The record says : "God 
created man of the dust of the earth and breathed into him the breath 
of life, and man became a living soul." He was never a living soul 
until that moment. What was he? A living spirit — whose habitation 
was in heaven. But when the body was created from the dust of the 
earth God put the spirit into the body, and man became a living soul, 
a child of God. It is not to be wondered at that God is interested in 
man. It is not to be wondered at that he desires his salvation. 



PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAWSON

SAVING PRINCIPLES 

Now, God is a pure and holy being, and in order that man might 
be saved it is highly essential that he should become like God. And 
if that be the case, it is imperative that man should repent of his sins 
and do works of righteousness, and until such time as this is brought 
about man cannot be saved. No impure or unholy thing can come 
into the presence of God and dwell there. This emphasizes powerfully 
the importance of the doctrine of repentance. 

And then if you put forth the saving principle of repentance there 
must be something to go with it. It is not complete in itself. It is 
not sufficient that a man shall repent of his sins. There still remains 
the weight of sin upon his soul. There must be some way to remove 
the weight of sin from his soul. God has provided the means, and it 
consists of baptism, baptism by water, by immersion, in the name 
of Jesus Christ, administered by one having authority, for the re- 
mission of sins. All conditions being equal, when the man comes forth 
from the water of baptism, his sins are washed away absolutely. If 
they are not washed away baptism is a mockery in the sight of God. 
If it does not accomplish this purpose there is nothing to it. But we 
maintain that it does, and the effect of baptism properly administered 
is apparent at once. That is, mark you, if it is a complete baptism, 
and it is not complete if it has to do with the water simply and nothing 
further. 

A NEW BIRTH 

Baptism, like many other things, is dual in character. There are 
two vital features connected with it. There is the baptism by water, 
or the birth by water, as Jesus said to Nicodemus, and there is the 
baptism of the Spirit, or the birth by Spirit. What kind of baptism 
is the baptism by the Spirit? the Christian world might ask. Do yon 
not know, ye men of the world, ye ministers of the Gospel, do ye not 
know what the birth of the Spirit is? If you do not let me enlighten 
you and say that it is the gift of the Holy Ghost, which comes upon 
a man by the laying on of hands of one having authority, and the gift 
is transmitted to the baptized believer. He is enveloped, buried as it 
were, in that spirit and power, the power of the Holy Ghost, the Spirit 
of truth, that brings to his memory things present, things past, and 
things to come. 

This is a complete baptism and it is described by the Savior as 
a new birth. We are born into the world. That is the first birth 
with which we have to do. What a wonderful thing that is ! What a 
tremendous privilege, that we were permitted to come into the world 
and take upon ourselves these bodies. And so now if we are to come 
into the Church and Kingdom 'of God it must be by some such means 
as birth. We must be born into the Kingdom of God. We cannot 
walk into it ; we cannot run or jump into it, or drop into it, or grow up 
into it ; we must be born into it. We must go through the door, and 
the door is baptism. 



78 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



SALVATION IN NO OTHER WAY 

You see that there is reason and logic in this great principle that 
is treated lightly by some people in the world, some people who say, 
"yes, yes, that is very well, if you want baptism you may have it; 
some of the churches will give it to you if you want it. If you do 
not want it you are at liberty to let it alone. You can have it or not as 
you please." But the Latter-day Saints say it is a vital principle of the 
Gospel and it cannot be set aside and must not be ignored. And so 
surely as the sun shines and truly as we live, no man or woman can 
come into the Church and Kingdom of God and be saved in his presence 
without passing through the door. 

FULFILLING AN IMPORTANT OBLIGATION 

Having passed through the door of baptism into the Kingdom 
this is just the initial step. We simply have the means, the blessing 
and the gift to become acquainted with the things of God, to grow in 
understanding, in knowledge and wisdom. And let me tell you of one 
thing — there are many things of course — but one very vital principle I 
would like to emphasize for a moment before I sit down. It was 
brought to my mind as I left the meeting this morning. 

I met a good sister who offered her hand and said to me : 

"Brother Clawson, don't you recognize me?" 

I said to her, "Yes, of course I recognize you, but for the moment 
I am unable to call your name. Your face is familiar to me." 

"W)ell," she said, "Brother Clawson you might forget me but I 
shall never forget you, because you once presided over me and over my 
people in the Box Elder Stake. My name is so-and-so." 

I said : "Surely it is, I recognize you now perfectly. How is your 
health? You are looking very fine, in fact, you have quite a youthful 
appearance." 

She said : "Brother Clawson, my health is very good, and do you 
know, I have had quite a family of children." 
"How many have you had?" 

She answered : "I have had twelve children and they are all living." 
Then I said to her : "Are they doing well ? Are they good children ?" 
She said, "Yes." 

I said to her : "You are very fortunate, you are a blessed woman, 
because you have given heed to that first great commandment that was 
given to Adam in the garden of Eden, when God said unto him and 
unto Eve, 'Be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth.' That 
was the obligation put upon Adam, and that is the obligation that 
rests upon his children." 

A PARTNERSHIP WITH GOD 

Then I said to her, "Do you know what that means? It means 
you have met this obligation, that you have fulfilled this great duty in 
life. It means that you have entered into a partnership with God 
Almighty. Now, that seems like strong language to use, to say that a 



PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAW SON 



79 



mortal man, or a mortal woman, has entered into partnership with 
the Lord. But it is true, for the Lord is the Creator of the souls of 
men, and it takes the spirit and the body to make a soul, a living soul. 
You and your good husband have created mortal bodies for twelve 
beings, twelve souls. That is your work, and God has contributed 
twelve living, eternal spirits and put them into those bodies. So you 
have become a partner with him. You occupy a very different position, 
entirely different to many of those grand ladies in the world, so de- 
nominated, so thought to be, with their wealth and their culture and 
their opportunities. These grand ladies seem to be satisfied and 
content to put their affections, and the affections of the human heart 
are very wonderful, upon the lower animals — dogs, cats, and monkeys." 

I said, "I have wondered many times what would be the feeling 
of these people that I am speaking of who are blessed with mortal 
bodies, when they appear before the bar of God and stand there con- 
victed of not having been willing to meet the great obligation of mar- 
riage which was instituted to people the earth." 

ADVICE CONCERNING MARRIAGE 

Now, brethren and sisters, this is an extremely interesting and 
important matter because the Latter-day Saints, and particularly the 
authorities of the Church, favor marriage. We advise our young 
people to marry when they have reached a proper and suitable age. 
Young ladies are marriageable at eighteen, nineteen, twenty, twenty-one 
and twenty-two, and later on. Young men at twenty-two, twenty-three 
and twenty-four, twenty-five and later on. It is their duty to go forth 
and honor this law of God. We say to them, be very careful and keep 
yourselves pure and undefiled. We say to the young men of Israel, be 
careful in selecting your companions. Make it a subject of prayer 
and much thought. Seek women of faith, women of pure lives ; and 
then be sure, be very sure that you are in love with the women you 
espouse and hope to marry. I would not say to love them with all 
your heart and soul, because that belongs to God. That duty is to 
him alone. But be sure you love the young woman sincerely and truly, 
and be sure that she is a good woman. Then, we would say to the 
young woman in making her choice : Be ye equally careful. Be sure 
the young man is of good character, pure in his life, that he is a young 
man of faith; and after all be very sure that you love him. Without 
love there could be no lasting happiness between husband and wife. 
Love is very binding in its nature and will help to hold them together. 

FOR TIME ONLY OR FOR ETERNITY? 

Then I should ask a couple if I were advising them, "What kind 
of marriage are you contracting? Is it a civil marriage or a temple 
marriage?" If a civil marriage, I should say: "Well that is a good 
marriage, that is legal. The United States of America stands behind 
the civil marriage. It is not the best marriage for you, however. There 
is another marriage that is far superior, and it is the Temple marriage. 



80 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



The Temple marriage is very different in character to the civil mar- 
riage." I would say to them : "You must remember, if you are married 
by the law of the land the contract holds good only until death, at 
which time the bond is broken. On the other hand, if you are married 
in the Temple the contract holds good for this life and the life to come, 
and you will have a claim on each other in that future life that cannot 
be had by the civil law." 

The young man or young woman might say : "Well, Brother Claw- 
son, I have heard that people who are married by the civil law, members 
of the Church, when they come up in the resurrection, will find the civil 
ceremony to be of no virtue or force. Is that true?" I would answer, 
"Yes, it is absolutely true." 

The girl might then say, "Well, I cannot subscribe to that idea. 
I cannot believe God would be so unkind as to separate me from my 
husband. I love him. He loves me. We love our children. Surely 
God will not separate us, will he?" 

And I would say, "No, of course the Lord won't separate you. 
No, he is too kind and merciful for that. You have separated your- 
selves. God would bind you together by his law, but you will not 
permit it, so that vou have already separated yourselves for the other 
world." 

She might persist in saying, "I do not believe it." 

Well, now, in conclusion I would say to her: "Let me refer you 
to a paragraph in the one hundred and thirty-second section of the 
Doctrine and Covenants (the thirteenth verse)." God, in speaking to 
Joseph Smith, his prophet, said : 

"Everything that is in the world, whether it be ordained of men, by thrones, 
or principalities, or powers, or things of name, whatsoever they may be, that are 
not by me or by my word, saith the Lord, shall be thrown down, and shall not 
remain after men are dead, neither in nor after the resurrection, saith the Lord 
your God. 

"For whatsoever things remain are by me ; and whatsoever things are not 
by me shall be shaken and destroyed." 

I would say to the young lady, "Mark it well. The Temple marriage 
is of God and therefore it is one of the things that cannot be shaken 
or thrown down." 

Let all the young men of Israel, and all the young women of 
Israel, whether they are married or single, remember that the Temple 
marriage will stand in the eternities to come when no other marriage 
will stand. 

God bless you, in the name of Jesus, Amen. 

The assembly arose and sang the first verse of "America." 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

As always happens in our Conferences we do not have as much 
time as we would like. We have a surplus of speakers, figuratively 



PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAWSON 



81 



speaking, but not enough time to hear from all. I will request the re- 
maining speakers this afternoon to watch the clock, and I would like 
them not to take more than fifteen minutes each. 

ELDER JOHN WELLS 

Second Counselor in the Presiding Bishopric 

I have been blessed with the privilege of performing a short mis- 
sion to Europe, having been appointed by the First Presidency. I was 
very glad, indeed, that this privilege came to me, for I have never been 
on a foreign mission. My labors as a young man while in England 
were quite extensive, though necessarily restricted to a branch in 
Nottingham and its nearby towns and villages. When I was asked 
to go to my native land for a short time, I was very happy about it, par- 
ticularly when a similar call came to my dear friend, Arthur Winter, 
who spoke to you yesterday forenoon and gave you some general 
ideas concerning our duties and the conditions in Europe. 

It might interest you to know that Brother Winter and I were born 
in the same town, played together as children in the same streets, went 
to the same school, and worked together in the same office. He heard 
and accepted the Gospel and labored assiduously with me month after 
month teaching me its wonderful principles and bearing constant testi- 
mony to its truth. Arguments, scriptural and otherwise, did not seem 
to affect me, but at last I asked the Lord to give me light and under- 
standing. When I did this fervently, I began to understand the Gospel 
and accepted it. Twenty-five years ago Brother Winter and I had 
the privilege of returning to our native land where we enjoyed a 
brief stay. Wjords cannot express our thankfulness to the Lord 
for the Gospel, for the marvelous opportunities that have come to both 
of us because of the blessings we enjoy, and for the privilege of 
coming to this goodly land where we had the opportunity to be trained 
and educated in the Gospel, and now after twenty-five years, we 
again return from England full of thankfulness to our Heavenly 
Father for all the Gospel has done for us. 

The First Presidency instructed us to report to President Widtsoe 
and to labor under his direction. During our voyage to Europe we 
received a radiogram requesting us to go on to Basel, Switzerland, 
instead of landing at Plymouth. At Basel we attended the closing 
session of the conference of European Mission Presidents. A day 
was spent with President Widtsoe who outlined what he would like 
us to do when visiting the missions. These instructions were carried 
out as far as time and circumstances would permit. Our work was 
mainly this : to reduce the clerical labor in the mission offices, to 
simplify and reduce, if possible, the labor of district presidents and 
secretaries, to encourage the organization of branches with the local 
priesthood in charge, to develop local self-government in the branches. 
President Widtsoe placed upon me the special duty to work out the 
organization, duties and functions of the Aaronic Priesthood, the 



82 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



law of tithing, the proper use of the tithes for mission purposes, the 
care of the poor, etc. 

It was very refreshing indeed to be in the company of President 
Widtsoe, with his splendid powers of administration and his wonderful 
grasp of the needs of the missions of Europe. Since he has been 
released as president of the British Mission, he is laboring night 
and day to organize and systematize the work of the various missions 
of Europe. 

Basel is the headquarters of the Swiss and German Mission. 
There we found a fine body of Latter-day Saints. There were many 
large branches of intelligent members, and by the time we had visited 
this mission and the German-Austrian Mission, we had a very high 
opinion of the German people. They are refined and educated and 
have very high ideals. 

Our next stay was in Geneva where we met with the President 
of the French Mission, who has a fine group of young elders. They 
are trying to allay prejudice and want the privilege of giving the 
French nation a fair opportunity to hear the Gospel. President Woolf 
has moved headquarters to Paris where he expects to organize a branch 
and to gather in quite a number of Latter-day Saints who are taking 
special courses in the great universities in science, art, and literature. 
There are some members of the Church who are residing in Paris 
permanently. 

On leaving Geneva we visited Oberammergau where we saw 
the great Passion Play. It is a wonderful production, but if I had my 
choice, I would rather see our own great pageant. I felt the influence 
of our own pageant more than that of the Passion Play. In saying 
this, however, I do not wish to belittle the marvelous work of the 
village folks of Oberammergau. 

From there we went to Czecho-Slovakia where we met a number 
of elders in the city of Prague. They are happy and optimistic as 
to the future. I believe the English language is spoken more in that 
city in proportion to its inhabitants than in any other foreign city. 
The elders were preaching to crowds of people in English. They 
found they were not making progress in acquiring the Czech language, 
so they resolved to speak only the Czech language among themselves. 
They are now prepared to go out into the country districts. I believe 
there is a great future in this land. The reformation started in the 
city of Prague. It was the home of John PIuss. I was gratified to 
hear that the people were thankful for what the United States has 
done for them in securing their liberty, and they are naming streets 
and other places after great men of the United States. 

From Prague we went to Dresden and found that President Ed- 
ward P. Kimball had been released because of the illness of his wife. 
He was just getting started in the work, introducing ideas for the 
development of the missionary work in the German-Austrian Mission. 
While there we attended the great health exhibition. The Latter-day 
Saint exhibition typified the words, "By their fruits ye shall know 
them." The exhibit stressed the Word of Wisdom and its results 



ELDER JOHN WELLS 



83 



on the people in Utah. A table had been provided in the room upon 
which were small folders called "The Word of Wisdom," and one 
hundred and twenty thousand of these folders had been taken. We 
then went to the former home of Karl G. Maeser in Meissen and stood 
in reverence before the house, discussing the life and labors of that 
great man. One of the brethren said, "What a marvelous work 
Brother Maeser did for the Church." He was answered by another, 
"Yes, and what a marvelous work the Church did for Brother Maeser." 

From there we went to Berlin where we met with a number of 
elders. That city has a fine body of Latter-day Saints and a splendid 
troop of Boy Scouts. We met with the branch members one night. 

The next stopping place was Copenhagen which has been one of 
the most fruitful missions of the Church. It is claimed that more 
people have embraced the Gospel in Denmark in proportion to its 
population than in any other country. A beautiful mission home 
and chapel are being erected there. The buildings are a credit to 
the community, and these two fine buildings will serve notice to the 
Danish people that the Latter-day Saints are there to stay. 

In Stockholm we were very cordially received. Several days were 
spent in office work. We met with the saints in their meetings on 
two different occasions. We also met with the local priesthood and 
with the missionaries; in fact, this was our policy everywhere we 
went. The people, as well as the missionaries, accorded us royal 
treatment, and when we left, a large body of the saints were at the 
station to bid us farewell and sang two of the songs of Zion, much 
to the astonishment of the passengers on the train. 

We continued our journey to Oslo where we attended to the 
business of the Church. We visited one branch forty-five miles south, 
met with the elders, and during our stay there the old folks' annual 
party was given. I noticed many elderly people who, under ordinary 
circumstances, will never have an opportunity to come to Zion, and 
yet they are full of faith and devotion. 

Our next visit was to Rotterdam. We met with the President and 
his staff and with the saints in Rotterdam and Utrecht. A special 
meeting was held with the elders in Utrecht at which there were 
thirty elders present out of the fifty in the mission. 

After that we went to Birmingham in England, which is now 
the headquarters of the British Mission. There we had the pleasure 
of meeting a large body of elders. After attending to routine and 
clerical work, we enjoyed the hospitality of President Lund and his 
wife. A few days later we met with all the district presidents along 
with President and Sister Widtsoe. 

Liverpool was our next destination. We reported to President 
Wlidtsoe our labors in the missions and to Sister Widtsoe we reported 
Relief Society, M. I. A., and Primary matters. In England we found 
a large number of Latter-day Saints out of work. Poverty is very 
closely related to the unemployed, but through the efforts of branch 
organizations, some are obtaining employment, and I am pleased to 
say that no Latter-day Saints are suffering for the necessities of life. 



84 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Many have inquired, "How did you find conditions in England, 
Germany, etc.?" We found serious business depressions and much 
poverty. We thought we noticed the demoralizing effect of the "dole" 
system in both countries. In most of the countries we visited there was 
a disposition to ignore religion. Some said, "What is the use of 
religion? It did not stop the war." We said in several cases that had 
the Gospel of Jesus Christ dominated the Christian nations, war would 
have been impossible. 

Some of the countries of Europe are still unsettled politically, 
as well as economically, and it is probable that during the next few 
years there will be serious changes in their forms of government. 

All the elders seem enthusiastic. They are developing remarkably. 
They are the finest body of men I have seen outside of Utah. I was 
delighted with their poise and intelligence. The captain on one of 
the ships said to me, "I am always glad when there are Latter-day 
Saint missionaries on my ship. They are the cleanest, best behaved, 
best mannered people that travel. I am always glad to have them. 
Tell your people that from me." 

As to the indifference of the peoples of Europe to religion, I 
am wondering. There is a reaction against all kinds of religion. The 
result will be, I believe, that in the near future honest men and women 
will look for a worth while religion, and I hope when that time comes 
such honest people will listen to the message of this Church. 

May the Lord bless the Latter-day Saints. May we sense deeply 
our responsibility to preach the Gospel and warn the world. May the 
quorums of High Priests, Seventies, and Elders rise to their responsi- 
bility and cooperate with the bishops so that the widow's son or daughter 
may have the privilege of going into the mission field. If each of the 
five hundred Elders' quorums, one hundred and fifty Seventies' quorums, 
and one hundred and four High Priests' quorums would make up their 
minds to support one missionary, the number on missions could be very 
materially increased. I pray the Lord to bless us all so that His will 
may be done and righteousness established in the earth. I ask these 
blessings in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER RULON S. WELLS 

Of the First Council of Seventy 

When the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ was restored and his 
Church again established upon the earth and endowed with power 
from on high a tremendous responsibility was placed upon it. This 
responsibility was twofold in its nature. First, the proclamation of 
that Gospel unto the inhabitants of the earth. As to how well the 
Church has discharged itself of that responsibility — and it is still en- 
gaged in it — these great gatherings of the Latter-day Saints upon 
the occasions of our General Conferences, bear eloquent testimony. 

Missionaries are sent to every part of the world, carrying the 
glad tidings of great joy, declaring unto the nations that God has 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS 



85 



spoken again and restored that Gospel which has within it the power 
of God unto salvation, making known unto the inhabitants of the 
earth the plan of life and salvation. What a wonderful work that is! 

These missionaries numbering two thousand and upwards, at the 
call of the Church, cheerfully leave their homes and their loved ones, 
oftentimes under most trying circumstances, pay their own expenses, 
even buying the literature which they use, and devote some two or three 
years of their time or as many more as may be required of them in the 
promulgation of the Gospel. Surely the first phase of this responsibility 
is being fairly met. Why all this noble endeavor, this great sacrifice, 
this hearty response which would be impossible under any ordinary 
circumstances? And why such devotion? Why was it necessary to 
restore the Gospel of Jesus Christ to the earth ? Because it was nowhere 
to be found among its inhabitants or as the Prophet Amos prophesied, 
there was a "famine in the land, not a famine for bread nor a thirst 
for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord." 

The other phase of that responsibility is the perfecting of the 
saints. Why have we come up to the mountain of the Lord, to the 
house of the God of Jacob? The scriptures tell us "that we might learn 
of his ways and walk in his paths." 

What was the matter with the earth that all this should be neces- 
sary? What was the condition that prevailed? The prophet Isaiah clearly 
saw in vision what the difficulty was. Said he : 

"The earth is defiled under the inhabitants thereof because they have 
transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, and broken the everlasting cove- 
nant." 

That was the condition that prevailed in the world, and to a very 
large extent it still prevails. With the restoration of this Gospel our 
duties are clearly outlined in the revelations that have been given through 
the modern prophet, Joseph Smith. Let me quote a few words from 
the Doctrine and Covenants as they are found in Section 88: 

"The spirit and the body are the soul of man. 

"And the resurrection from the dead is the redemption of the soul. 

"And the redemption of the soul is through him that quickeneth all things, 
in whose bosom it is decreed that the poor and meek of the earth shall inherit it. 

"Therefore, it must needs be sanctified from all unrighteousness, that it may 
be prepared for the celestial glory." 

Here it is very plainly pointed out, the great problem that we 
have before us. This world that is defiled under the inhabitants thereof 
must be called to repentance. They must turn unto the Lord. They 
will not all do it, but those who have accepted of that glorious message 
and have been brought into the fold of Christ are expected to lay hold 
of eternal life. 

From these passages we learn that these souls of ours are consti- 
tuted of a spirit and a body, the spirit which came from God, begotten 
of him in the spirit, and a body which we receive from mother earth. 
That spirit and that body in combination constitute the soul of man.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



How are we going to sanctify this earth from all unrighteousness ? 
Merely by sanctifying the souls of those who inhabit it. This earth 
that "is denied under the inhabitants thereof" for the very simple 
reason that they had transgressed the laws and are still transgressing 
them, for the very reason that they have changed the ordinances, broken 
the everlasting covenant, the covenant of the Gospel of the Lord Jesus 
Christ, that new and everlasting covenant that is designed, given and 
revealed unto the children of men for the express purpose of sancti- 
fying their souls from all unrighteousness — that is why it has been 
revealed from heaven. It has within it the very power of God unto 
salvation unto the sanctifying and purifying of our souls. 

W!e have heard during the sessions of this Conference of many 
things that we can do. There is the wonderful activity that is going 
on to spread a knowledge of this Gospel among the children of men. 
After we have received the Gospel and have come up and identified 
ourselves with the people of God are we sitting supinely by and think- 
ing that the Lord will do the rest of this work ? We read in these passages 
that the redemption of our souls will be through him who quickeneth 
all things, him who made and fashioned the universe, who made every 
living thing; through him who gave us life, original life — who causes 
the grass to grow upon the earth, the insects to creep, the birds to fly, 
the fish to swim, the beasts to roam upon the field. Through him 
who quickeneth all things, and created man in his own image — even our 
Creator. Through him is this redemption of our souls to take place and 
not through any act of ours. He will redeem us. From what ? From 
death and the grave. But there is something for us to do. He is 
our Redeemer. He also died not only that we might be redeemed 
from death and the grave, but that our own sins might be blotted out 
on the condition, however, of our obedience to his plan. Even God 
could not save and redeem us from our own sins unless we repent of 
them, unless we do our part and sanctify and purify our souls. There- 
fore it behooves us that we shall do our part that our souls may be 
redeemed from the consequences of our own sins. 

To sanctify and purify our souls from all unrighteousness or in 
other words, the perfecting of the saints, is the second phase of this 
great responsibility. How is this to be accomplished? After hearing 
the words of the Lord and believing on him, and ceasing the trans- 
gression of his laws, restoring the ordinances that have been changed to 
their primitive purity, and again renewing that "everlasting covenant" 
that has been broken, let us go on to perfection. How? Let me 
enumerate a few of the things which have been revealed for this express 
purpose : 

1. The law of tithing has been mentioned in this Conference. 
Avarice is a soul-destroying vice; it is the love of money that lies 
at the root of all evil. Obedience to this law lays the axe at the very 
root of all evil. Observe it then as a means of sanctifying your soul 
from all unrighteousness. 

2. Remember the Sabbath day and attend your sacrament meetings 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS 



87 



as a means of spiritual growth and with clean hands and pure hearts 
partake of those sacred emblems which testify to our faith in him who 
died upon the cross. If you do this, you are eating and drinking eternal 
life into your very souls. 

3. A Word of Wisdom designed for the health of the body 
wherein may dwell the Spirit of God. A sound mind in a sound body 
or as the Latin philosopher puts it: "Mens sana in corpore sano". It 
was given as a warning against present day evils, clearly shown to the 
Prophet Joseph in prophetic vision, and also with a promise of immunity 
against the destroying angel. 

These subjects have all been discussed by various speakers during 
this Conference. Let me call your attention to one more requirement 
which if properly met, will surely sanctify our souls and prepare us 
for the celestial glory. I refer to prayer. The Lord has commanded 
that we shall pray without ceasing. Does he really mean that? Most 
assuredly he does. The Lord gives us no commandment that he does 
not mean. Of course he does not intend that we shall always be 
on our knees nor unceasingly speaking words of prayer, and yet he 
does intend that we shall pray without ceasing. Then what is prayer ? 
"Prayer is the soul's sincere desire, uttered or unexpressed," as we 
sometimes sing and have sung during this Conference. The real 
prayer, the true prayer is a condition of the heart. When we bow the 
knee and offer up our verbal petitions, we are giving expression to 
prayer and this should be done at frequent intervals, every morning 
and every night, but the prayer itself is in the heart and must be 
constant and unceasing. It follows, then, if our prayers are to be 
effectual we must be deeply concerned over the condition of our hearts. 
What is lurking there? Watch and pray. Are our desires pure and 
holy? or are we praying for the sordid things of this world, for the 
gratification of our evil desires? Be sure of this that whatever those 
desires may be, whether good or evil they will surely find expression, 
for "out of the fulness of the heart, the mouth will speak." Be careful 
then, as to what you harbor in your hearts. 

Prayer is a daily exercise in the fundamental principles of the 
Gospel. It is practicing faith, drawing nigh unto God that God may 
draw nigh unto you; it is practicing repentance, for when you turn 
to God of necessity you 'turn away from evil. When you pray you 
confess your sins to God and seek forgiveness, the very thing for which 
baptism has been provided in the plan of life and salvation, and surely 
we seek to obtain God's Holy Spirit, even the gift of the Holy Ghost, 
which has been sealed upon our heads by the laying on of hands. 

The Lord has taught us how to pray. Pray for your enemies and 
those that despitefully use you. Do you do that? I don't know what 
effect your prayer will have on him who thus despitefully uses you but 
I do know it will do you good if you will sincerely pray for him. 
How? It will cast all hatred out of your heart and make you a better 
man or woman, and aid you in keeping that great commandment: 
"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." But how can I love my 



88 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



wicked neighbor who mistreats and cheats me and otherwise despite- 
f ully uses me ? Well, the Lord didn't say you should only love your 
good neighbor but: irrespective of whether good or bad, love him as 
you do yourself. Let me ask : Do you love yourself because you are 
good? Not so! The meaner a man is the more he loves himself. And 
that's exactly what makes him so mean. Some people say their prayers 
are not answered. Perhaps not exactly as we offer them. What an 
unfortunate thing it would be if all our prayers were answered in 
precisely the way we pray. What confusion and dismay ! It would 
completely upset the plan of the Almighty. Let me say, however, every 
true prayer offered in sincerity will be answered in blessings on our 
heads. "Ask and ye shall receive." 

Then let us pray to our Father in heaven for the triumph of Zion, 
that his kingdom may come and his will be done on earth as in heaven ; 
for our daily bread or the things we stand in need of day by day ; for the 
forgiveness of our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against 
us; (how vain will be our prayer if we do not forgive others) that 
we be not led into temptation but delivered from all evil. Let this be 
the unceasing prayer in our hearts and as sure as the day follows the 
night shall our souls be sanctified from all unrighteousness, and being 
thus sanctified we shall be saints in very deed and be prepared for the 
celestial glory. 

The Lord has permitted us to be called "Saints." Are we that? 
Yes, if we have the Spirit of God. What is a saint? A saint is a 
sanctified being. Then let us cultivate the gift that is within us which 
we received by the laying on of the hands of the Elders of this Church, 
and if we obtain and retain this gift even the gift of the Holy Ghost, 
it will surely lead us into the presence of God, to dwell with him and 
his Son, to whom be all the praise, for his is the kingdom and the power 
and the glory, forever. Amen. 

ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 

Of the First Council of Seventy and President of the Temple Block 

Mission 

As I reflect on what has been said at this Conference, I feel more 
deeply than ever before that communion with God is the greatest fact 
of life. All our words, all our activities, all our ideals find their 
meaning here. The spirit of religion is not the burden of duties that 
makes life prosaic, but it is a personal mystical union with God, to 
be attained each man for himself. It is a knowledge of the nearness 
of God. The chief characteristics of the Gospel of Jesus Christ are 
its divine truth and beauty. In Keat's Endymion is this lovely thought : 

"A thing of beauty is a joy forever: 

Its loveliness increases. It will never pass into nothingness ; 
But still will keep a bower, quiet for us and a sleep 
Full of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing." 

The Gospel of our Lord is a message of beauty, and a joy forever. 



ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG

It teaches us that the way of true life is not the world's way. The 
Prophet Joel tells us in sublime words that "Ye shall know that I 
am in the midst of Israel, and that I am the Lord your God, and 
none else : and my people shall never he ashamed. And it shall come to 
pass afterward, that I shall pour out my spirit upon all flesh ; and your 
sons and your daughters shall prophesy; your old men shall dream 
dreams, your young men shall see visions." 

What the Christian world needs today is to know Christ; and the 
world can only know Christ by its coming to know the" living, personal 
God, the Creator of heaven and earth and all things therein. He is 
our Heavenly Father, and in his image man is created. Jesus Christ 
came to redeem us, and to teach us the divine truth of eternal life. 
Turning to the American scriptures, the Book of Mormon, which in 
the years to come will be more widely read and better understood, I 
read these words as recorded by the prophet Nephi : 

"And now it came to pass that there were a great multitude gathered together, 
of the people of Nephi, round about i:he temple which was in the land of 
Bountiful ; and they were marveling one with another, and were showing one to 
another the great and marvelous change which had taken place. 

"And they were also conversing about this Jesus Christ, of whom the sign 
had been given concerning his death. 

"And it came to pass that while they were thus conversing one with another, 
they heard a voice as if it came out of heaven ; and they cast their eyes round 
about, for they understood not the voice which they heard; and it was not a 
harsh voice, neither was it a loud voice ; nevertheless, and notwithstanding it 
being a small voice it did pierce them that did hear to the center, insomuch 
that there was no part of their frame that it did not cause to quake; yea, it 
did pierce them to the very soul, and did cause their hearts to burn. 

"And it came to pass that again they heard the voice, and they understood 
it not. 

"And again the third time they did hear the voice, and did open their ears 
to hear it ; and their eyes were towards the sound thereof ; and they did look 
steadfastly towards heaven, from whence the sound came. 

"And behold, the third time they did understand the voice which they heard; 
and it said unto them : 

"Behold my Beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased, in whom I have 
glorified my name — hear ye him. 

"And it came to pass, as they understood, they cast their eyes up again 
toward heaven; and behold, they saw a Man descending out of heaven; and he 
was clothed in a white robe ; and he came down and stood in the midst of them ; 
and the eyes of the whole multitude were turned upon him, and they durst not 
open their mouths, even one to another, and wist not what it meant, for they 
thought it was an angel that had appeared unto them." 

The people heard and cleansed their hearts and understood. Then 
in the Holy Bible is the story of St. John concerning the resurrection 
of Christ. It is lovely in its simplicity; it is the comforting message 
of the ages. 

(Gospel of St. John 20:1-19). 

"The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it was 
yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre. 

"Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, 
whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away the Lord out of 
the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him. 



90 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



"Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple and came to the 
sepulchre. 

"So they ran both together; and the other disciple did outrun Peter, and 
came first to the sepulchre. 

"And he, stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes lying ; yet 
went he not in. 

"Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, and 
seeth the linen clothes lie, 

"And the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, 
but wrapped together in a place by itself. 

"Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the sepulchre, 
and he saw, and believed. 

"For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the 
dead. 

"Then the disciples went away again unto their own home. 

"But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping ; and as she wept, she 
stooped down, and looked into the sepulchre. 

"And seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the other 
at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain. 

"And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto them. 
Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid 
him. 

"And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus stand- 
ing, and knew not that it was Jesus. 

"Jesus saith unto her. Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? 
She supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou have borne 
him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away. 

"Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and, saith unto him, 
Rabboni ; which is to say, Master. 

"Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not, for I am not yet ascended to my 
Father : but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, 
and your Father : and to my God, and your God. 

"Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, 
and that he had spoken these things unto her 

"Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the 
doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came 
Jesus, and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you. 

Down through the ages, people have sought after Christ; some 
have found him. But the new contact with God came a hundred 
years ago when a little boy — a pure boy and filled with faith — went 
into the woods to pray for light and truth. God the father and Jesus 
Christ, the Son, came to him. Joseph Smith heard the message of 
the Father, and it was then that Jesus Christ became a living reality. 
Man had again been brought into communion with God. 

This fundamental truth is at the very foundation of the Gospel 
of Jesus Christ; and it takes this new revelation to understand life 
and immortality. When the world will open its heart to these three 
historic truths, mankind will again know that life has a meaning, and 
a meaning for good. Men will direct their lives in accordance with 
God's will, and come unto greater faith and more abundant life. 
Knowledge alone cannot solve our social and religious problems ; but 
knowledge with faith in God can. This thought is beautifully ex- 
pressed by George Santayana of Harvard University: 

"O world, thou choosest not the better part, 
It is not wisdom to be only wise. 



ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 



91 



And on the inward vision, close the eyes; 
But it is wisdom to believe the heart. 
Columbus found a world, and had no chart, 
Save one that faith deciphered in the skies ; 
To trust the soul's invincible surmise 
Was all his science and his only art. 
Our knowledge is a torch of smoky pine 
That lights the pathway but one step ahead 
Across a void of mystery and dread. 
Bid then, the tender light of faith to_shine 
By which alone the mortal heart is led 
Unto the thinking of the thought divine." 

God lives; Jesus Christ is the Son of God and the Redeemer of 
the world. The beauty of his message will always appeal to the 
children of men, for in it they will discover that there is an infinite 
power in each and every child that leads him to the meaning of life. 
A new era opens before us, and if we will pursue the path that has 
been mapped out by Christ our Lord, we will grow unto perfection 
through service and our spirits will take flight to more distant summits 
from which we can become a light unto mankind. May we as a people 
take new courage ; may our faith in the message of the Lord increase 
and deepen from day to day. Amen. 

After the singing by the congregation of the hymn, "High On the 
Mountain Top," Elder William T. Jack pronounced the benediction, 
and Conference adjourned until Sunday morning. 



THIRD DAY 



MORNING MEETING 

Every seat in the great auditorium and galleries of the Tabernacle 
was taken, and every available space in the aisles was occupied Sunday 
morning, October 5, 1930, when the hour for beginning the fifth session 
of the Conference arrived. Many people who could not get inside 
the Tabernacle found seats in the Assembly Hall and others remained 
on the Tabernacle grounds, where they listened to the services as they 
were broadcast by radio. 

President Heber J. Grant called the meeting to order promptly at 
10 o'clock, and announced that the Choir and the congregation would 
sing the hymn, "We thank thee, O God, for a Prophet." 

After the singing, prayer was offered by Elder Arthur V. Watkins, 
President of the Sharon Stake. 

A duet and chorus, "An Angel From on High," was rendered by 
Cyril Martin and Ida Hepworth, and the Choir. 

ELDER REED SMOOT 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

I want to express my thanks to my Heavenly Father for the priv- 
ilege I have of attending this great Conference. If the people of the 
world, who think that Mormonism, so-called, is losing its force or its 
membership, could but stand upon this platform and look into the faces 
of this magnificent audience, their doubts or apprehensions — or wishes, 
in many cases — would be expelled. 

I know that this is the Church of the living God. I know that the 
Church, as established in this latter day, is the Church spoken of by 
the prophets of old, and I know that the destiny of this Church shall 
be as prophesied, and all the requirements made of the people belonging 
to this Church will be fulfilled. Men holding the Holy Priesthood, men 
holding responsible positions, from the President of the Church down, 
will fulfil every requirement, and the Gospel of Jesus Christ shall be 
preached to all peoples of the earth, before the end shall come. 

INDIFFERENCE OF THE WORLD TOWARD RELIGION 

There is an indifference manifested, I think, throughout the world, 
toward religion. That indifference, it seems to me, is growing; I am 
quite sure it is among many of the people that I am called to associate 
with. They deny the power of God. They deny the power of the 
Priesthood. They deny even the work of the Savior and his mission 
here upon this earth. 

My brethren and sisters, when we think of the fact that the Gospel 
has been established upon this earth for a hundred years, and thousands 
and tens of thousands of missionaries have been sent to nearly all parts 



ELDER REED SMOOT 



93 



of the earth, bearing testimony that God has revealed his mind and 
will and has established his Church again upon earth, the headway 
that we have made in that one hundred years may seem small to some, 
but the seed has been planted, the authority of God has been conferred 
upon man, and his Church organized ; and I haven't the least doubt 
that every revelation that has been given concerning it, concerning its 
work, concerning the peoples of the world, will be fulfilled. 

Many times in my conversations with public men, they deny, 
without hesitation, that there is a God. They deny that it is possible 
to receive a revelation from God, the source from which we claim to 
receive revelations. 

"believe the works" 

I often think, my brethren and sisters, of the time when Jesus 
himself was upon the earth, and of the statements that were made by 
him to the Jews as to his coming, his mission, his authority. They 
were ready to stone him; and we find the Savior answering, upon an 
occasion of that kind, as follows : 

"If I do not the works of ray Father, believe me not. 
"But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works : that ye may 
know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in him." 

So say I to the world. If you don't believe that the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has the authority to speak for God 
or for man, believe in the works of its members; see what they have 
accomplished; see what character of men and women the Church is 
composed of. 

If it were possible I would like to have such men upon this platform 
today and let them look into the faces of this magnificent audience, see 
and hear the faith expressed by the servants of God. I would like 
them to understand that every one within the sound of my voice will say 
"Amen" to the testimonies that have been given during this Conference, 
and have faith that the predictions that have been made will be fulfilled. 

Have you noticed — I certainly have — that active members in the 
Church seldom apostatize? That is natural. They are interested in 
the work. They know that it is God's work, and being active in it, 
they obey the commandments. They never cease to pray themselves. 
They never cease to have family prayers. They never cease endeavor- 
ing to live so that men, seeing their works, can at least believe that the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ has an influence upon their lives. 

One of the best ways in the world to preach the Gospel is by 
example, and many times you can reach people in that way of preaching 
that you could not in any other way. So we boldly say to the world : If 
you do not believe in the professions and testimonies made by us as to 
this being God's Church, his power made manifest in the organizations 
and through the individuals of the Church, believe the works of this 
people ; compare their labors and works with those of any other people 
upon earth; compare their honesty with that of any other body of 
people on earth; compare their loyalty to our government, with the 
loyalty of any other people on earth. 



94 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



SOMETIMES A LACK OF FAITH 

My brethren and sisters, we believe and we know that the Gospel 
of Jesus Christ, when it is manifested in the life of an)' man or woman, 
makes him or her a better citizen, and makes him or her more loyal, 
no matter where it may be. Sometimes some of us may lack faith. 
I think perhaps that is rather natural, for as I read the scriptures I 
find that men in the favor of God himself sometimes waver a little 
in their faith. 

May I call your attention to the case of Gideon. Gideon, a servant 
of God, holding the priesthood of the living God, having a mission to 
perform, knowing it to be a mission, had doubts ; for don't you re- 
member he asked of God, so that there could be no doubt in his mind, 
that a sign be given to him, namely, that a fleece of wool which he 
would place upon the floor, should upon the morrow be wet with dew 
and the earth all about it be dry. And through the goodness of God 
the manifestation was made to him. Even then Gideon was not satis- 
fied, for in order to be sure that the requirement was one for him 
to undertake, he then requested : "Please, Heavenly Father, let the wool 
be dry and upon the ground let there be dew." And with all patience 
it was so granted unto him. "Oh ye of little faith !" 

OUR GREAT MISSION 

I want to say at this time, my brethren and sisters, that I feel 
just as sure as I live, that every requirement made by our God has been 
made for a purpose, and it is our duty to live to the requirements made 
by this Church ; and I am positive that the God of heaven will bless 
those who fulfil these requirements. 

Of course, we all know that there is a change in attitude toward our 
people. I am thankful to my Heavenly Father that this is the case, 
but I do want to warn the people that if, through the goodness of 
God, that change has come, and we, through that fact, become slackers 
in his Church, it would be a great loss indeed. Oh, how little interest 
there is in religion today ! I mean a religion such as the Latter-day 
Saints possess. How many people are there in all the world, outside of 
the Church, that will testify that there is a living God, and that Jesus 
is the Christ? Not many of them. 

So, my brethren and sisters, we have a great mission to perform. 
The time must come when this Gospel will be preached to every kindred, 
tongue and people upon the earth. I have often wondered how that 
could be done, but modern science has solved that. President Grant 
can stand upon this platform and testify and his voice will carry to the 
farther ends of the earth. Who knows but that God will provide that 
means of transmission of the testimonies regarding God and his work 
upon this earth, in order that the Gospel may be preached to every 
living creature. God never made a requirement of any people in any 
age of the world, unless he provided a way for the fulfilment of that 
requirement. 



ELDER REED SMOOT

BLESSINGS THROUGH OBEDIENCE 

The greatest gift of God is eternal life. Is it worth living for? 
Is it worth sacrificing some of the pleasures of life for? To me it 
seems that it is worth everything — eternal life ! 

God has established his Church in this dispensation. He has made 
promises to his people, and among them is the one that if they obey 
his commandments, if they live according to the teachings of the 
Master, if they fulfil all the laws of God while living upon this earth, 
they are entitled to the promised blessing's of God. 

May God's blessings ever attend his Church. May it grow and 
increase in power and in numbers, and may our lives be such that 
people who come in contact with any member of the Church will know 
at once that there is something in Mormonism different from any other 
religion. A thorough investigation will reveal that this difference 
lies in the fact that we are members of the Church, that we believe 
in its principles ; and those principles are the ones that will give us 
eternal life if we will live them. 

May the people of the Church live in such a way, and may we all 
labor to the end that every prediction made by the prophets of God, 
as to this last dispensation, shall be fulfilled. God grant us eternal 
life, God grant us wisdom while we remain upon this earth, and God 
grant that his Church may grow in power and in strength and in in- 
fluence, and reach the hearts and souls of all honest men and women 
in the world, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

PRESIDENT CHARLES W. NIBLEY 

'Second Counselor in the Eirst Presidency 

I rejoice in the work of the Lord. I know that every command- 
ment that he has given to this Church, through the Prophet Joseph 
Smith makes for righteousness, for right living, for better citizenship ; 
makes better husbands, better wives, better children. There is not a 
single thing, a single thought or idea, in all those commandments, 
but what is uplifting and for the bettering of humankind. 

I would like to read a few verses from (Solomon, the wise man, 
contained in the first chapter of his Proverbs, commencing at the 
twenty-fourth verse. These verses of scripture seem to cover the situ- 
ation today as though they were spoken concerning this generation : 

"Because I have called, and ye refused, I have stretched out my hand, 
and no man regarded ; 

"But ye have set at naught all my counsel, and would none of my reproof ; 

"I also will laugh at your calamity ; I will mock when your fear cometh ; 

"When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a 
whirlwind ; when distress and anguish cometh upon you. 

"Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me 
early, but they shall not find me; 

"For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the Lord. 

"They would none of my counsel; they despised all my reproof. 

"Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with 
their own devices.

"For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of 
fools shall destroy them. 

"But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from 
fear of evil." 

IN A CHANGED WORLD 

The old order changeth ; the new world is upon us. We live today 
in a changed world from even thirty years ago. At the beginning of 
this century — take, for example, one item — there was scarcely an au- 
tomobile seen anywhere in the United States at that time. Only thirty 
years, within the memory of all of us, and yet today the building of 
automobiles, the opening of gas stations, with stores upon every street 
for accessories and equipment, employs, I suppose, probably four or 
five million men. That is to say, the old order has so changed, just in 
thirty years, that four or five millions of men are employed in a new 
occupation, which was not known, or scarcely known, thirty years ago. 
So rapidly do we move in these days. Necessarily all that affects our 
conditions of life. It affects our expense account. Automobiles have 
now become necessities. We are almost compelled to have them. 
Indeed, the working man goes to work now in a cheap automobile and 
can well afford it to save time going from his home to his work. 

These changes affect employment. Especially do they affect em- 
ployment when an industry of that kind, going at full blast, stops all 
at once, or practically stops ; the demand ceases. It is a great calamity 
come upon the nation — maybe it isn't a calamity at all, but a providence 
of the Almighty to stop our mad rush of speculation, in which stocks 
go tumbling to the bottom, and men who were rich, almost beyond 
compare, yesterday, are practically penniless today. And so industry 
stops, and men are thrown out of employment. They are not idlers. 
I would not plead for the idler, for one of the revelations through 
the Prophet Joseph Smith says, in these words : 

"The idler shall not eat the bread nor wear the garment of the laborer." 

THE UNEMPLOYED NEED HELP 

We do not approve of idleness. In our Church industry is one 
of our principal doctrines : "Work out your salvation in fear and 
trembling before the Lord." But I do plead for those who are out of 
employment at this time. There is not time to go into a discussion very 
fully regarding these changes that come about so quickly, but here they 
are; they confront us; they demand solution. The best we can do, 
temporarily, is, as the President of the United States has pointed out, 
for our municipalities, our counties, our states, and civic organizations, 
to do everything they can to put in motion some work, that men who 
are willing to work may find employment. 

The Lord tells us, in another revelation, that men ought to be 
diligently engaged in a good cause, without being commanded. We 
ought not to wait till the bishop asks us, or till the President of the 
Church asks us to do something to help relieve this situation, to try to 
help our neighbors and our friends. 



PRESIDENT CHARLES W. NIBLEY 



97 



Whoever can do anything in the way of providing employment 
for this poor person who has no work, ought to do it without waiting 
to be asked; for "He who waits," the Lord says, "to be commanded 
in all things, the same is a slothful and not a wise servant." 

Let every man and every woman who can do anything do so. 
We nearly all can contribute something towards relieving this situation ; 
and let me say, even the poor can help, for after all is said and done, 
it is the poor who help the poor, generally speaking ; it is not the rich. 
Brethren and sisters, let us try to do what we can to see that employment 
is furnished for those who are out of employment, and who perhaps 
are in absolute, abject need. They should be taken care of some way. 

NATIONS PERPLEXED 

Now, I have probably spoken as long as I should. I feel a great 
concern in respect to this matter. I see changes coming upon the 
face of the earth. I see the perplexities of nations. England is per- 
plexed today over this situation ; so is Germany ; Our own country, too. 
War is still extant ; there is one at this moment in China ; an uprising 
in India, and also in Turkey. Wars are going on upon the face of 
the earth. We may think that wars have ceased, that peace is here. 
But not so. There is perplexity of nations. This is one of the signs 
of the end, of the coming of the Son of Man. The warning is that 
"Nations should be in commotion and perplexed" because of the sit- 
uations arising which the wisest of statesmen can scarcely solve. 

The scripture I read at the beginning says: "The prosperity of 
fools shall destroy them. But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell 
safely and shall be quiet from fear of evil." 

However, we can help to solve our own little affairs by keeping 
the commandments of the Lord, by being kind to each other, by con- 
sidering our neighbors. My brother, my sister, I have sympathy, and 
we should have sympathy, and do have, I am sure. 

HOW TO HELP THE POOR 

The Lord help us to build up the kingdom of God, to sustain it, 
to pay our tithes and our offerings. If we would just pay our fast 
offerings once a month, if the five hundred thousand of our people in 
the United States would only pay thirty cents a month per capita on 
fast day, that alone would be $150,000 a month, or in ten months 
$1,500,000. With that we would have abundance to give to the poor 
whose necessities are demanding attention. 

Now let us, my brethren and sisters, keep the commandments of 
the Lord, and build up his kingdom. Let us love the Lord our God, 
seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all things 
needful shall be granted unto us. Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

We will be pleased to hear next from Elder J. Reuben Clark. 
Brother Clark has just been appointed Ambassador to Mexico. All 
Utahns are proud of the honor that has come to one of our citizens.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ELDER J. REUBEN CLARK 

My brethren and sisters, it is indeed an honor to be asked to say 
a few words to you this morning. I recall a statement that was made 
by the great Dr. Karl G. Maeser. He said : ''There are two occasions 
in a man's life when it becomes him to say little. The one is at the 
beginning of his work, and the other at the end of it." I stand at the 
beginning of my new work. 

I am proud and grateful for my ancestry. I am proud and grate- 
ful for my association with you. I am grateful for the testimony 
which has come to me of the truth. I pray that always there shall 
be with me the Spirit of God. 

As President Grant has said, I am to be appointed American 
Ambassador to Mexico. I have had some residence in that country, 
and I have come to have for that people a sympathy and a love I have 
not felt for any other people. 

Mexico is our neighbor. We should treat Mexico as a neighbor. 
The great Mosaic law which had in it the doctrine, "An eye for an eye 
and a tooth for a tooth," taught also : "Thou shalt love thy neighbor 
as thyself." On that great day in the Temple, during the last week 
of the Savior's mission on this earth, when they were trying to tempt 
him into some kind of a confession upon which they could base a 
prosecution, a lawyer asked him what were the great commandments, 
and he replied: 

"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy 
soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind, and thy neighbor as 
thyself." 

James, in his epistle, speaks of the law, "Thou shalt love thy 
neighbor as thyself" as the "royal law" and while we are accustomed 
sometimes to think that nations do not deal one with another on such 
a basis, I may be permitted to say that the fundamental principle of 
international conduct, international relationship, and law, is that you 
shall ask the other nation to do nothing which you are not yourself 
willing to do, and that you shall complain about nothing which the 
other nation does and which you yourself do. 

When John Adams went to Paris to assist Franklin and Jay and 
Lawrence in the negotiation of the treaty of peace with Great Britain 
at the end of our Revolutionary War, he found them involved in a 
discussion as to whether or not they should pay the debts that were due 
to the Tory colonists. When the matter was presented to him he said 
that he wanted the Tories paid, that he had "no notion of cheating 
anybody." 

What we thus said in our pride as a young, new-born nation surely 
we can say now that we have the power and the strength that has come 
to no other nation during the whole history of mankind. 

God grant that there comes to me in my work — for I go to it with 
something of a knowledge of what it means — his Spirit to guide me, that 
I may represent the people of the United States adequately in my life, 



ELDER J. REUBEN CLARK

in my attitude, in my work. God give to me the faith and the prayers 
of you, my brethren and sisters, that I may be able to perform my 
mission honorably, I ask this in the name of Jesus, Amen. 

Upon request of President Heber J. Grant the Choir and con- 
gregation arose and sang the first and last verses of "America." 

ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 

Presiding Bishop of tthe Church 

I regret, my brethren and sisters, that through some trouble that 
is not yet discovered, the amplifiers on the public address system are 
not serving satisfactorily this morning. The technicians are working 
actively to try to discover just what the trouble is. Apparently, the 
cables leading from this building to the panel have been affected by 
steam in the tunnel, and there has been some short circuit which has 
interfered with the effective transmission of the energy. 

I rejoice with you in this splendid Conference, and I am tre- 
mendously impressed with the sight of this magnificent audience. 1 
hope that I may be able to speak in such a way that I can be heard. 
I rejoice in my membership in the Church. I appreciate the considera- 
tion and kindness shown me by the First Presidency, the other General 
Authorities, presidencies of stakes, bishoprics of wards, mission presi- 
dents and the members generally in my labors. 

DESTINY OF THIS WORK 

I have absolute confidence in the destiny of this great work. 
What is that destiny? It is, as I see it, to bring to the people of the 
earth, everywhere, living faith in God and to promote righteous- 
ness, truth and peace. Yet there are people who, for some unknown 
reason, seem to fear that the fulfilment of the destiny of the Latter-day 
Saints would threaten the welfare of other peoples. Can there be any 
question as to the fact that, if the destiny is as I have stated it, it is 
only for the advancement of mankind generally? There is in the 
heart of every Latter-day Saint nothing but the best of feeling toward 
all men. For we are all desirous that, as we have received the light 
and message of the Gospel, others also may receive it ; even as many 
as are willing to listen thereto, and to receive of the blessings which 
follow acceptance and observance thereof. 

WELFARE OF CHURCH MEMBERS 

We have been favored with splendid instructions by all those who 
have spoken in Conference thus far. There have been discussed various 
problems that affect the welfare of this people; and not only of this 
people but of mankind. I want to say to you that I am sure, because 
I have occasion to have some contact with them, that the First Presi- 
dency are vitally concerned with the welfare of every Latter-day 
Saint, and, for that matter, of mankind everywhere; and that they 



100 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



are concerned, not only with the spiritual, but also with the temporal 
and material progress of the Latter-day Saints. 

MATERIAL AFFAIRS, PART OF OUR RELIGION 

Understanding, as we do, that we are eternal beings, and that 
we have come upon this earth for an important purpose, and that in 
our mortal state we must live, eat, wear clothing, and partake, to 
some extent, at least, of the comforts and conveniences of life, we 
appreciate the fact that material and temporal, as well as spiritual, 
things are a part of the Gospel. This is particularly so if we cultivate 
in our hearts the idea that all that we obtain, all that we have, all 
that we do, we are doing and using with an eye single to the glory 
of God, and to the advancement of his work. If we can get that 
spirit in our hearts and minds, we shall realize the fact that material 
and temporal things are a part of our progress and development, 
while here upon the earth in preparation for eternity. 

INJUNCTION TO WORK 

One of the problems that is confronting us at the present time, 
in common with the rest of mankind, is that of unemployment and 
the decrease in industry. From the earliest history of mankind, we 
learn that in the days of Adam the Lord gave him this injunction : 
"In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread." Later on, in the time 
of Moses, the Lord declared to his people, in regard to the Sabbath 
Day: "Six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work, but the seventh 
is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God. In it thou shalt not do any work." 

WORK DAYS PER WEEK 

So, since there was one day for rest, there were six days for 
labor. In the meantime, with the growth of industry, many of those 
engaged therein have gotten the idea at times that seven days per week 
are necessary for work. Consequently, many industries have been 
working regularly seven days a week, and preventing their employees 
from enjoying the fruits of the Sabbath Day, when, as a matter of 
fact they could, in many instances, limit their work to six days. 
But nowadays, with the increased development in mechanical ap- 
pliances and equipment, men are coming back to the realization that 
six days a week is sufficient, and that even a five-day week may be 
advantageous. Thus, men may be able to earn enough in five days 
per week, due to improved conditions in industry, when they are 
working properly; so that they would have two days for leisure 
and for worship. 

NECESSITY OF WORK 

Now, I say, the importance of work has been stressed not only 
in previous ages of the world's history, but, also, more extensively in 
this period. The Lord has revealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith, 
as contained in the Doctrine and Covenants, the instruction that labor 
is necessary for mankind, as one of the fundamentals in our progress 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 101 



in this life and throughout eternity. The Lord has specifically de- 
clared: "Thou shalt not be idle; for he that is idle shall not eat the 
bread nor wear the garments of the laborer." That involves physical 
and mental labor, and it involves also labor in a spiritual sense. 

VALUE OF WORK 

Thomas Carlyle declared: "Blessed is the man that has found 
his work. Let him ask no other blessedness." Again, J. H. Patterson 
says : "It is only those who do not know how to work that do not love 
it. To those who do it is better than play ; it is religion." A certain 
artist says, regarding success: "The greatest single element in any 
one's career is work. This is the despot that escorts you to the winning 
post." Another writer declares — "Work! Thank God for the might 
of it, the ardor, the urge, the delight of it. Thank God for a world 
where none may shirk, thank God for the splendor of work." I am 
sure that every one of us who has labored, and does labor, has ap- 
preciated the value of work and the importance of it ; that it is a part 
of our lives; that it develops us. It develops our physical strength. 
It develops our mental keenness. It gives us courage. Stimulates 
desire for achievement. It inspires in us consideration for our fellow 
men. Every one of us is expected to labor, to learn the value of 
labor, to appreciate the joys of achievement, and the benefits that 
come therefrom. 

RESULTS OF LABOR 

When we consider the tremendous results that have occurred 
through the ingenuity of mankind, and through the application of 
that ingenuity to the production of commodities that make for progress 
and development, and provide comforts and conveniences, we can ap- 
preciate the wonderfully beneficial results of labor from the material 
standpoint. I am reminded, by the way, when we speak of ingenuity 
and inventiveness, that we, in America think we are in the forefront. 
I noticed, however, recently, that America stands only about seventh 
or eighth in the matter of inventiveness. The little country of Switzer- 
land stands first of all the nations in inventiveness, Germany next, 
France next, and so forth. 

RIGHT TO WORK 

Now, as it is necessary that men should work, and as they have 
been enjoined to labor, as idleness has been condemned as being un- 
fruitful and tending to degradation and demoralization, at the same 
time, it follows that there ought to be the opportunity to work. Every 
man has the right to work, and some provision should be made whereby 
he can obtain work. In earlier days men were able largely to provide 
their own employment. In ancient days people lived simply, choice 
land was freely available, men had their flocks and herds, and they 
cultivated the land to the extent that they found it necessary in order 
that they might draw therefrom a sustenance. 



102 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



SPECIALIZATION 

Nowadays, with the complexity of civilization, it is not so easy 
always for men to secure employment. With this increase in com- 
plexity of industry and of civilization men are learning special trades 
and professions. It is a day of specialization. One of the Brahmanist 
proverbs says, with regard to trades and the importance of them: 
"The parent that does not teach his child a trade, teaches him to be 
a thief." Whether that be true or not, the fact is that with present 
conditions the learning of trades and the application of those trades 
to industry is of great importance. 

man's stewardship 

If those who labor have in their minds appreciation of the fact 
that that which they do and the opportunity that is given to them 
to work is, in fact, a blessing from God ; that of the things that they 
acquire, since they are only tenants here upon the earth, part at least 
really belongs to the Lord ; and if they cultivate that appreciation, they 
will then be willing, if they are taught the principle, to observe the 
law of tithing which has been discussed this morning, and at other 
times during this Conference, which means the giving of one-tenth 
of the product of one's labor and of one's increase to the Lord, for 
the promotion of righteousness, truth and faith. Where people observe 
that principle they receive blessings. 

TIT HEPAYERS AND EMPLOYMENT 

In connection with that, and this question of unemployment, I 
am reminded of a statement made by President William R. Sloan, 
of the Northwestern States Mission. He stated, the other day, that 
through a careful investigation made in his mission, it was shown 
that in the case of every full tithepayer, there was not one who had 
lost his job in the midst of this depression. Every one of those who 
were paying full tithing has been able to retain his work. Is that, 
to you, any evidence of the benefits that come through the observance 
of tithing? That is not, however, the primary purpose of tithing. The 
primary purposes are to train us in obedience, to help us to overcome 
selfishness, to give of our service and our means to the building up 
of the work of God, and to the extension of these things which make 
for the welfare of mankind. 

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS 

I need not discuss with you in detail the present economic con- 
ditions. We realize what they are. Our staple industries in this state 
and in other parts of the country are depressed tremendously because 
of the low prices of those products. Wheat, wool, sugar, and the 
metals, which affect us directly, are low in price. They are affected 
by over-production, decrease of demand, and lack of proper distribu- 
tion. The result is depression and resulting unemployment. It has 
been suggested, and it seems to me a very desirable thing, that there 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 



103' 



should be provision made by the government for the registration 
of all those who are not employed, and special efforts made to try 
to provide employment for them. There are positions and jobs open, 
in some instances, that might be filled by those who are most worthy, 
if their names and the kind of work that they are able to do were 
available. 

STIMULATION OF INDUSTRY AND CONSTRUCTION 

It is, of course, a very desirable thing that industries should be 
stimulated in this locality and other localities, where possible, to take 
the raw materials and to produce manufactured goods therefrom that 
are in demand. In connection therewith, any possible construction that 
can be done at this season of the year and during the winter time, in 
order to save trouble and suffering to those who are out of employment 
at the present time, would be very helpful. I want to indorse the recent 
editorials in the Deseret News and in the Salt Lake Tribune, with 
regard to the urging of construction work that can properly be under- 
taken during this fall and winter, by the cities, counties, and states, to 
the end that those who are out of employment may be able to get some 
help, at least, in that direction. 

HOW THE CHURCH CAN HELP 

How can the Church help in this respect? The Church has been 
charged with being materialistic. Now, the Church is not in a position, 
as it used to be when it practically occupied this community entirely, to 
undertake public works. But it can help in trying to put members of the 
Church in contact with opportunities for jobs. There can be no ob- 
jection, surely, on the part of any one to that. We should not undertake 
to open employment offices for people generally, because that is not 
our function, but we are justified in trying to contact with those who 
need employment, among the members of this Church, and to help them. 

HELP MEMBERS TO HELP THEMSELVES 

It is our business also, as bishoprics of wards, to see that no one 
suffers. The Church is carrying a heavy responsibility to see to it that 
none of the active members of the Church suffers for the necessities 
of life. But in all of this, the effort of the Church authorities, the 
bishops, presidents of the stakes, and relief societies, is to help people 
to help themselves. The policy is to aid them to become independent, in 
order to be able to serve and to help to build up the Church, as well 
as the community, rather than to have to depend upon the Church 
for assistance. Yet in times of need, — and there are such times that come 
to many people — the Church properly steps in and undertakes to help 
them, and to bring into action other agencies which can help to promote 
better conditions and the avoidance of suffering. 

EMPLOYMENT BUREAU 

I want to call your attention to the fact that there have been 
suggestions made whereby, in every community throughout the Church 



104 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



where there is unemployment, conditions can be improved. In this 
city the presidencies of the six city stakes, and the bishoprics of the 
wards have organized the Deseret Employment Bureau, — a central 
head — where members of the Church in these stakes can come to seek 
employment. They are first registered and the necessary information 
obtained regarding their addresses, qualifications, references, and mem- 
bership, and then those in charge seek to find employment for them. 
The result has been that out of about 1800 men who have registered 
there for the nine months of this year, about 1200 have secured some 
employment. Also, the General Board of Relief Society, which has 
an employment bureau for women, has done at least as much in the 
way of getting employment for women and girls during the same 
period. Surely, that is a very helpful thing. 

EMPLOYMENT PLAN 

But that is not all. These six city stakes and the wards included 
therein have undertaken not only to provide a control employment 
bureau as a place of final reference after local efforts have been ex- 
hausted, but they have undertaken to organize in each ward an em- 
ployment committee, consisting of a high priest, a seventy, and an 
elder, together with a relief society member, under the direction of 
the bishopric. This committee's function is to seek out those in the 
ward who are out of employment, list their names, addresses, and 
qualifications, and then in connection with all the priesthood members 
in the ward, to try to place them in contact with employment. If 
the priesthood are unable to get employment for them, then they are 
recommended to the control bureau, which represents the stake agency. 

RESULTS IN MAR VISTA WARD 

In this connection, I want to just briefly tell you what is being- 
done in one of the wards in California, which is carrying out this 
very thing. Brother Orson Hewlett told this story of the Mar Vista 
ward in Los Angeles. They have a committee of this kind. Every 
Tuesday evening, when they hold their priesthood meeting, those who 
are out of employment are asked to raise their hands, their names and 
addresses are taken, and the kind of work they can do noted. Then 
if there is any one there who can suggest any opening for them — 
and there are often opportunities that men know of right there in that 
meeting — they are referred to those places. After these names are 
taken, this committee and others of the priesthood undertake to try 
to find them employment. The report is that splendid results have 
been obtained. Not only that, but the complete census of that ward 
has been taken and, in connection therewith, there have been listed, 
in type-written form, the names, addresses, and kind of work that 
those who are out of employment can perform. The result is that 
they are making headway and helping in that way to relieve suffering 
and avoid trouble and distress. I am sure that, if the priesthood 
quorums throughout the various wards of the Church will carry out 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 



105 



this plan wherever unsatisfactory conditions prevail, a great improve- 
ment will be manifest. 

BENEFITS TO THE PRIESTHOOD 

We notice from the Deseret Employment Bureau reports that 
the applications for employment in the last few months have decreased 
somewhat. Whether or not that is due to the fact that employment 
conditions are improving, I am not prepared to say. However, I 
want to say to you that if all the wards and stakes, where any unem- 
ployment is found, will organize these priesthood committees for 
welfare work and for employment, and if the relief societies will 
also organize for this purpose, as is being done in many of the wards, 
that a great deal of trouble will be overcome. The priesthood quorums 
throughout the Church will help materially in putting the man in con- 
tact with the job, thereby providing gainful effort, and overcoming the 
necessity of providing charity. In addition thereto, the indirect benefits 
accruing therefrom to the various priesthod quorums will produce 
a finer social atmosphere, develop a greater cooperative spirit, promote 
brotherly love and fraternal fellowship, increase attendance at priest- 
hood meetings, increase tithes and offerings, and produce splendid 
brotherhood. 

I appreciate the blessings and privileges of the Church. I realize 
the fact that there is divine guidance through the inspiration given 
to those who lead this Church. I pray that we may sustain them, 
and labor together diligently, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

There are four brethren who have returned from missions who 
have not yet reported — Brother Andrew Johnson from the Swedish 
Mission, Brother J. A. Cahoon from the Tongan Mission, Brother 
Hyrum W. Valentine from the German-Austrian Mission, and Brother 
Edward P. Kimball from the German-Austrian Mission. We will 
ask these brethren if they are here to come to the stand and address 
us, occupying not more that ten minutes each in their remarks. Brother 
Valentine will be the next speaker after the Choir sings the first hymn 
in our hymn book, entitled, "The Morning Breaks, the Shadows Flee." 

This hymn occupies a place of honor in our hymn book, and I 
think, justly. Brother George Careless, a former leader of the Choir, 
composed the music. As there are only twenty lines to the hymn, I 
am going to take the time to read it all. 

"The morning breaks, the shadows flee ; 
Lo ! Zion's standard is unfurled. 
The dawning of a brighter day, 
Majestic rises on the world. 

"The clouds of error disappear 
Before the rays of truth divine; 
The glory bursting from afar, 
Wide o'er the nations soon will shine. 



.106 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



"The Gentile fulness now conies in. 
And Israel's blessings are at hand ; 
Lo! Judah's remnant, cleansed from sin, 
Shall in their promised Canaan stand. 

"Jehovah speaks ! let earth give ear, 
And Gentile nations turn and live ; 
His mighty arm is making bare, 
His covenant people to receive. 

"Angels from heaven and truth from earth 
Have met and both have record borne ; 
Thus Zion's light is bursting forth, 
To bring her ransomed children home." 

The Choir then sang- the hymn, "The Morning Breaks, the Shadows 
Flee." 

ELDER HYRUM W. VALENTINE 

Former President of the German- Austrian Mission 

My brethren and sisters, I can assure you that I feel that this 
is a very signal honor for me, but I feel tremendously weak and 
most humble in this responsible position. 

I have enjoyed exceedingly the spirit of this Conference. I 
have been thrilled with the messages that have been borne in upon 
us, and I give myself willingly over to the inspiration of the Lord, 
that I too may be the means of adding to or emphasizing the messages 
that we have already received. 

I thank the Lord for my membership in this Church, and I 
have been made to say frequently and recently that I believe the time 
has long since passed when we should speak of the duties and obli- 
gations that rest upon us, as members and workers in this great and 
glorious service ; for I believe that it is not so much a duty, and not 
so much an obligation that is resting upon us, but it is a divine privilege 
and opportunity to be a member of this Church ; and the greatest 
blessing that can ever come to us in this world or in the world to come, 
is to be called upon to render service in this great and glorious cause. 
I thank the Lord for such a testimony in my heart, and I pray that 
he may give me the power to take advantage of the opportunities 
and blessings that are afforded me in this divine work. 

We will not know the divinity of this work except by participa- 
tion therein. I have often said, and I desire to repeat, that of all 
people in the world we are the six or seven hundred thousand who, 
if the opportunity were given, and if it were made possible for all to 
speak with one voice, would be able to rise upon our feet and say, 
"I know this is the work of God" — a literal fulfilment of the promise 
of the Savior of the world, when he said: "They that. do the will 
shall know of the doctrine." And I say the six or seven hundred 
thousand people that we have as members of this Church can rise 
and say that they know of themselves that this is the work of God. 



ELDER HYRUM W. VALENTINE 107 



May we press on, and may we realize that there are specific things 
that we must do, and not only be members of the Church, in order to 
realize the growth, the progress, the opportunity, the blessings that are 
ours in this great work, through our activity and participation. Where 
in all the world is there such an opportunity for work and service for 
boys and girls, little children, adults, and those who are advanced in 
years, as in this the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints? 

This organization has sometimes been compared with the German 
army. It should not be compared with any army or any navy, but it 
should be contrasted. This is the Church and Kingdom of God, the 
perfection of an organization for growth, for progress, for develop- 
ment, for construction; whereas an army, a navy, is an organization 
that may be effective, it may be efficient, but if it is it is effective and 
efficient for destruction and disintegration. And for that reason the 
two cannot be compared, but contrasted. 

Thank God for our membership! Thank God for our leaders! 
Thank God for the divinity that is characterized in every activity of 
this work ! May the Lord help us to be faithful and true and diligent 
and energetic, grasping our opportunities, I pray in the name of Jesus 
Christ, Amen. 

ELDER EDWARD P. KIMBALL 

Former President of the German- Austrian Mission 

I am deeply appreciative of this honor, although I face this re- 
sponsibility with timidity, realizing that the time of the General Con- 
ference is so valuable. However, if I may have the Spirit of the Lord 
to aid me in expressing some of the things that have been in my heart 
during the sessions of this Conference, I sincerely hope that the few 
minutes I occupy will not be wasted. 

Naturally, when one returns from the mission field, his thoughts 
are on missionary work, and mine are on missionary work, particularly 
during this Conference. I have rejoiced in the admonitions that I have 
heard the brethren give with regard to better missionary work. 

I should like to make a plea this morning in behalf of the at least 
thirty-eight thousand Saints who are in the European missions. These 
are the only people I know in the mission field. I realize that if we 
could take our charge more seriously, if we could begin earlier in the 
preparation of our missionaries, we could bring a great blessing to 
those people. This thought was never brought home to me as directly 
and emphatically before as it was about one year ago, in a city in 
Germany. 

In the German-Austrian Mission we are doing missionary work 
in ninety-one fields. In these ninety-one fields there are seventy-two 
organized branches, and thirty-three of these organized branches are 
entirely in the hands of the local priesthood. President Widtsoe is 
laying great stress upon the desirability and the advisability of giving 
our brethren and sisters in those missions the same opportunity for 



108 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



development which has been given to us by activity in the quorums and 
organizations. He is pointing out to the missionaries and to the Saints 
that all the officers and the leaders of this Church have been men and 
women who have come up from the ranks, who have come up from 
the common people. 

W!e are beginning to realize in those missions that it is not possible 
for all to come to Zion. I rejoiced when a letter went out from the 
First Presidency of the Church a year ago, urging the mission presidents 
and missionaries to encourage our people to remain in the missions, 
to develop themselves there, and to build up the Church. In reading 
the revelations of the Lord I have been thrilled to find that it was never 
the intention that the Saints should all come here. I have come to a 
conclusion that it is not intended by the Lord that there shall be two 
types of Latter-day Saints — one type in the missions, who are under 
certain restrictions, and a different type here at home. 

I maintain, my brethren and sisters, that when a group of men 
and women who have accepted the Gospel in the same way we have are 
ninety per cent faithful in the payment of their tithing ; when they are 
more than that faithful in the keeping of the Word of Wisdom ; when 
they are ninety-five per cent faithful in attending their meetings, the 
promise which was made by the Lord in the 133rd section of the Doc- 
trine and Covenants will become operative in their behalf, namely, that 
in the days when the missionaries should be sent out, the people of the 
world should hear the fulness of the Gospel in their own tongue, by 
those who are ordained to this work — not necessarily men who are sent 
from the center stakes of Zion. 

About a year ago we called one of our fifteen young, full-time 
German missionaries upon a mission. He comes from a large branch. 
His father has been in the Church about thirty-five years, and has 
borne the Melchizedek priesthood for probably twenty-five years. 
The young man was born in the Church. I had the opportunity, six 
months after he went into the field, of visiting a conference in the 
branch from which he comes. His father naturally was interested to 
know what kind of a record his son was making, and when I told 
him that the boy was measuring up in every manner to the responsibility 
of missionary work, he replied something like this : "Why shouldn't he? 
Before you call our boys on missions they must have a testimony of 
the Gospel. They must keep the commandments, including the Word 
of Wisdom, the law of tithing. They must attend all their meetings." 

Now, my brethren and sisters the day of the make-shift, temporary, 
front trench organization in the missions is past, at least it is in the 
European missions, and the mission from which I come is moving 
rapidly toward permanency. We desire soon to put before the Au- 
thorities of the Church a building program. We desire that our Saints 
there shall have the same privilege of worshiping in desirable places 
that you have. I don't believe that the Lord is a respecter of persons, 
either in or out of the Church. I don't believe that he intends that you, 
here in the shadow of the temples, shall worship in marble palaces, 



ELDER EDWARD P. KIMBALL 



109 



and that our brethren and sisters over there shall always worship in 
stables and vacated factory buildings. 

The thing that we are trying to do now is to develop them along 
the lines of self-government, and I am proud to testify to you that in 
the thirty-three branches where the local brethren have charge of the 
work we are making marvelous progress. I say to the credit of my 
predecessor, Brother Valentine, that we have built upon the sure foun- 
dation which he laid. 

• The Doctrine and Covenants says : "To some it is given by the 
Holy Ghost to know that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, and that 
he was crucified for the sins of the world; to others it is given to 
believe on their words." And I believe that if the members of 
this Church went down into their own experiences, into their own hearts, 
they would find that their testimony has come to them more through 
believing on the words of those who do know. I maintain that it is 
possible for every man and woman to have a testimony. I don't believe 
that we should allow our young people to be converted to this Gospel 
through the flesh. It cannot be done. Give them all the education we 
want; give them all the logic and the science it is possible to get, the 
same as Paul ; but even Paul, when he was left merely to the workings 
of the flesh, was not a servant of the Lord. It was only when the 
finger of God touched his heart that he received his testimony. 

I believe that missionaries are made in the homes. I believe that 
our brethren and sisters should, in their lives, set an example of right- 
eousness before their children, so that by the time these children reach 
the age when our young people are ordinarily called on missions, they 
may not only know according to the flesh, according to the mind, the 
principles of the Gospel, but that their hearts shall be touched with a 
testimony which will lead them to go out into the world, seeking first 
the kingdom of God, desiring to know whether God lives and whether 
this work should come to all,_and knowing when it is given, that it is 
going to transform the lives of those into whose lives it has come, 
as it has done in hundreds of thousands of cases. 

I bear my testimony to the Saints that there is no desirable or 
honorable profession or business in this world in which a man cannot 
reach the utmost heights and still remain a Latter-day Saint. I thrilled 
when I heard that a full-souled, converted Latter-day Saint had been 
appointed Ambassador to Mexico. I thrill when I think that an Apostle 
of the Lord, on an equal footing with every other citizen in this land, 
stands at the head, practically, of the influence in the Senate. 

I tell you, as I look over the Church and as I look at the missionary 
work today, the work of the Lord needs the best brains, the best heart, 
and the best testimony that can be had. If we are gaining in respect 
in the eyes of the world, there is a greater responsibility upon us. 
Roosevelt spoke a powerful truth, a few years ago, when he said : "The 
greatness of the fathers becomes to the children a shameful thing if 
they use it only as an excuse for inaction, instead of as a spur to effort 
for nobler aims."

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Now, my brethren and sisters, we of the younger generation, let 
us not sell our birthright for a mess of pottage. Let us rise, and raise 
the standard, and show those who have gone before us that even in our 
days of affluence, even in our days of plenty, even in our days of ease, 
it is still possible for a testimony to burn within the heart of a Latter- 
day Saint in this day, as in the days of the other generations that have 
gone before us. 

Let us not live in the past. That is what is the matter with the 
nations and the churches of the world today. They are living in the 
past. We have done wonders in the last hundred years, but if we 
want to know what the Church is going to arrive at in the next hundred 
years, I can give you the key : Look now into your own hearts ; look 
into the lives and the testimonies of your boys and girls, and you shall 
see what the Church is going to accomplish in the next hundred years. 

God give us the power and the disposition to train our boys and 
girls into a knowledge that the work of the salvation of mankind has 
been committed to the Church of Jesus Christ as an organization 
God grant this, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER HYRUM G. SMITH 

Presiding Patriarch of the Church 

I desire, my brethren and sisters, to have the Spirit and blessings 
of the Lord, to express my gratitude for your faith and prayers, and for 
the mercy and blessings of the Lord that I am able to be present 
upon this occasion, to enjoy in a degree the blessings of health and to 
enjoy the teachings and testimonies of my brethren. I am pleased to 
see this house filled with those who are not here to be seen of men, 
but to serve the living God, and to receive further strength and en- 
lightenment to honor him in the work that is sacred and important in 
this day and time. 

HAPPINESS THROUGH BLESSINGS OF THE GOSPEL 

For some reason or other there has never come into my life that 
happy privilege which has come to many of the missionaries of going 
into the world and seeing people hearken unto their testimonies and 
come from a world of darkness into a new world of light and under- 
standing. But it has come to my heart to be happy when I hear the 
testimonies of my brethren, for I realize that joy has come to their 
hearts through the blessings of the Lord upon their humble words 
in defense of truth and righteousness. So I share with them the 
great joy of seeing our brethren and sisters accept the truth and come 
out of the world — all the nations and kindreds and tongues of the 
world — fulfilling the great promises of our Lord in gathering his 
children to the truth. 

STRIVE FOR PEACE 

I am grateful for the peace that exists in the Church today. It 
has always been my pride to he a peacemaker, and to abhor contention 



ELDER HYRUM G. SMITH 



111 



and strife. I would like to bespeak for the Church a greater degree of 
peacemaking. Wje should all be peacemakers, every one of us, first 
with ourselves, in our homes, and then with our neighbors. I bespeak 
for you, my brethren and sisters, a further degree of energy and dili- 
gence in the preparation for peace in our own homes and in our own 
hearts. Then the strength of our testimonies, through our works, 
will continue to grow and bear fruit, even in spite of the fact that war 
and contention may be around us. 

MAKING A PROPER USE OF OUR AGENCY 

I realize also that it is our right to do as we please ; in other words, 
we have our agency. The Lord has never taken it from us, and I 
am of the opinion that he never will, so long as we do as we please in 
a manner that will not interfere with any one else in his right to do as 
he pleases. Yet we should be wise, prudent, and careful in the use 
of our agency. We are naturally prone to do the things that we know 
how to do and the things that we like to do. We get into the habit 
of doing things, sometimes in spite of the fact that we know better 
than we do. We know 'we should do better. We know we should 
do differently than we do, yet we know we have our agency. There- 
fore, I sincerely admonish my brethren and sisters to strive more dili- 
gently to do the thing's they know best to do, and then strive to do 
better all the time the right thing. 

I have heard it said and preached that there are many among us 
who pray: "Oh Lord, help us to be right, for our minds are already 
made up." That is largely due to the fact that we are in the habit 
of doing about as we please. I hope, my brethren and sisters, when you 
go to your homes, after this Conference, that you will do very much as 
you please, but please be more careful, more prayerful, more humble, 
and more willing to do the things you have been taught, the things 
you know are better than your own way, even better than you have 
ever done in the past. By this means we will all grow in the spirit 
of brotherly love, in the spirit of the Lord, and in the spirit of peace. 

THE WORK OF THE LORD 

I realize that the time is well spent, but this is a glorious privilege 
to stand here and look into the faces of thousands of my brethren and 
sisters who 'I am sure know as well as J do that this is the work of 
God, a marvelous work and a wonder. There is nothing in all the 
world today more wonderful than the work of the Lord, especially 
the work which has been entrusted to the hands of the Latter-day 
Saints. 

Every part of my body, every bit of strength that I possess, every 
atom of my being, bears testimony that this is the work of the Lord. 
In fact, I know nothing else in all the world so well as I know that 
this is the work of God. I pray for greater strength, greater courage, 
a ■ greater degree of obedience, that I may go forth with you, my 
brethren and sisters, and live in such a manner as to enjoy the blessings 
the Lord has in preparation and in store for us. 



112 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



BLESSINGS THROUGH KEEPING COMMANDMENTS 

I assure you, my brethren and sisters, through the spirit of testi- 
mony that fills my soul, that the Lord is not going to leave us, nor 
this people, without his blessings. If you will use your agency in 
honoring him, through keeping his commandments, he will bless you 
in your homes, in your stores, in your fields, in your places of business. 
He will bless your herds and your cattle and your folds. He will bless you 
in all your righteous endeavors to do good ; he will open up the way be- 
fore you, that you may have a greater desire to share with others, and to 
prepare your sons and daughters to go upon missions in defense of his 
work, in a spirit of true unselfishness. I know that the blessings of the 
Lord are rich in preparation for the faithful of Israel, both scattered 
and gathered, and I pray that his Spirit and blessings may continue 
to grow in your hearts and be at your hand, that you may serve and 
honor him and be in very deed what you profess to be. 

I bless you and promise, my brethren and sisters, that in whatever 
capacity you are called to labor, whether at home or abroad, peace, 
contentment, and a greater degree of courage will come to you in your 
work. 

THE NEEDY AND UNEMPLOYED 

I pray also that the Lord will bless those who are unemployed, 
that through a spirit of willingness to work and to share they may 
enjoy the spirit of peace and the opportunity to provide their necessities. 
I pray the Lord to bless all the needy, and leave none to suffer unjustly 
or unnecessarily. As his servant, I bless the Church to this end, that 
in the Church, through using the powers which God has given us, we 
may not suffer nor allow our neighbors to suffer unjustly, nor un- 
necessarily. 

May the Lord bless us all and continue to inspire those whom 
he has called to lead Israel, from his servant, the President of the 
Church, down to the least and last one called, whether in the priesthood, 
in the auxiliary organizations, in the temples, in the schools, in the 
fields or shops, in the offices, or wherever they are called to labor. 

I bless the Church and those who are working honestly and willingly 
to honor and serve the Lord in righteousness and truth, that in their 
hearts peace may abide, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

There appeared in the Deseret News last night, occupying nearly 
an entire column, a list of influential citizens who are engaged in 
marking Utah Pioneer trails — landmarks along the trails. We would 
like all of our people to take interest in this matter. It is something" 
that every citizen of Utah should be interested in, without regard to 
creed or religion. We are pleased to see many of the most influential 
men of the City and State engaged in this movement. 

We would like every one to remain in this building after the

benediction until the Choir has withdrawn and become stationed in the 
place where they are to sing for the Movietone News. Their singing 
is to be heard probably by about thirty million people through the 
instrumentality of the talking pictures. The Fox Movietone people are 
here to take the picture. 

I wish to say that we are obtaining most marvelous and wonderful 
response from the broadcasting by radio of the singing of the Choir 
and the renditions on the Organ every Monday afternoon. We have 
received letters from all oyer the country giving expressions of delight 
regarding these recitals. The broadcasting company that has charge 
of this work has written to us expressing delight and appreciation. 
It is no small thing for our Choir and our Organ to be heard all over the 
United States. This advertises Salt Lake City in a most remarkable 
way. We are grateful to the radio broadcasting people for giving 
us this privilege. We are grateful for the loyalty of our Choir and 
our organists for giving their services in these special recitals. We 
are thankful to the employers of Choir members for releasing them 
to come here and give those broadcasts, and I say without fear of 
contradiction that they are one of the greatest advertisements for Salt 
Lake City that could possibly be had. In fact we know that other cities 
(I won't mention the names of any of them) are complaining and 
asking for the same privilege, but they do not happen to have the 
Mormon Tabernacle Choir nor do they have the great Tabernacle 
Organ. But they would like to advertise their own towns. 

An anthem, "The Song of the Redeemed," was rendered by the 
Choir, led by Evan Stephens, the former leader of the Choir and 
composer of the music to this anthem. 

The benediction was pronounced by Elder John F. Bowman. 

Conference adjourned until 2:00 p. m. 



THIRD DAY 
AFTERNOON MEETING 

The closing meeting of the 101st Semi-Annual Conference was 
held Sunday, October 5, 1930, at 2 o'clock, President Heber J. Grant 
presiding. 

The Tabernacle was crowded to capacity and thousands of people 
listened to the radio broadcast of the services, in the Assembly Hall 
and upon the Tabernacle grounds. 

The Choir and congregation sang the hymn, "Come, Come, Ye 
Saints." 

Elder Henry H. Rolapp offered the opening prayer. 
The Choir and congregation sang "The Spirit of God Like a Fire 
is Burning."

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ELDER CHARLES H. HART 

Of the First Council of Seventy and President of the Canadian Mission 

It has been a pleasure to share with you, my brethren and sisters, 
the instruction and inspiration of these Conference meetings. Some of 
the meetings have not been broadcast, some of the best. Last evening, 
for instance, we had very wise and rich instructions from the Presiding 
Bishop of the Church and from the Presidency of the Church, each 
of those four individuals, and again this morning at the Assembly Hall 
at the M. I. A. gathering where our President spoke under the in- 
spiration of the Lord and was very greatly blessed. 

I had the opportunity of attending the Canadian missionary re- 
union last evening, and I was a bit late in getting around to the As- 
sembly Hall meeting this morning, but did get there in time to hear 
President Grant. He spoke of the wonderful instruction contained in 
the Era, particularly some of the short editorials. I read one a short 
time ago entitled "The Disappearing God." That title is one that had 
been used in an article published in Scribner's for June, in which the 
author, Mr. Henswood Ward, in his concluding sentence said: 

"The God that used to hear my prayers is disappearing, is being nebulized 
out of existence by the Holmes, the Ameses and Millikins." 

Mr. Ward refers to a book written by a former minister and now 
the editor of a Christian magazine and says : 

"After I have read it I can think of nothing but the massacre of God that 
is being made by the best religious thought of the day." 

The editor of the Era goes on to say that a great educator from 
California, standing near the Seagull Monument and listening to the 
story of how the seagulls saved Utah, remarked : "I can believe that 
the Almighty intervened to save a people as prayerful as were the 
pioneers." 

Then he went on to say : 

"The trouble with the world today is that to be considered educated a man 
must know all about the gods of mythology, but he need know nothing whatever 
about the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the true and living God." 

And so the world today does not believe very strongly in a personal 
God, although there are some Christians who are coming to believe 
in a personal Deity. There are too many of them that believe in that 
God expressed by the Russian poet Derzhaven : 

"O Thou Eternal One whose presence bright 

All space doth occupy, all motion guide; 
Unchanged through time's all devastating flight! 

Thou only God — there is no God beside! 
Being above all beings ! Mighty One, 

Whom none can comprehend and none explore, 
Who fill'st existence with thyself alone — 

Embracing all, supporting, ruling o'er; 

Being whom we call God, and know no more." 



ELDER CHARLES H. HART 



115 



Not the God of the Old Testament, nor the God of the New Test- 
ament. Not the God of John, as recorded in his first chapter: 

"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the 
Word was God. 

"And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us," etc. 

It is not the God of Paul, as described in the first chapter of 
Hebrews, first three verses : 

"God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto 
the fathers by the prophets, 

"Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath ap- 
pointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds ; 

"Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, 
and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself 
purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high." 

Paul is considered even a little "off" by some modern Christians. 
It was an eye specialist to whom I took one of our missionaries for 
special treatment who characterized Apostle Paul as a neurotic — Paul, 
of whom it was eloquently said by Bossuet: "He went into polished 
Greece, the mother of oratory and philosophy, and there established 
more churches than Plato had acquired disciples, by an eloquence that 
was thought divine. He pushed his conquests still further. Rome 
even listened to his voice. He brought the majesty of the Roman fasces 
to the feet of Jesus in the person of a proconsul ;" then the declaration 
is made that the day would yet come "when her citizens would deem 
themselves more honored by an epistle of St. Paul addressed to them 
than by all the far-famed harangues delivered in the forum by Cicero." 

In stopping at the home of Daniel Webster while passing through 
a part of our mission territory, in the State of New Hampshire, I 
found this sentiment being distributed, a declaration of the man who 
is voted by Harvard, the oldest university in America, as being one 
of the seven great orators of the world : 

"I love to dwell on the tender recollections, the kindred ties, the early 
affections, and the touching narratives and incidents which mingle with all I 
know of this primitive family abode. 1 weep to think that none of those who 
inhabited it are among the living ; and if I ever fail in affectionate veneration for 
him who reared it and defended it against savage violence and destruction, 
cherished all the domestic (virtues beneath its roof, and through the fire and 
blood of seven years revolutionary war, shrank from no danger, no toil, no 
sacrifice, to serve his country, and raise his children to a condition better than 
his own, may my name and the name of my posterity be blotted forever from 
the memory of mankind." 

So if our Brother Kimball takes just pride in doing honor to his 
distinguished father, we can understand that that is a sentiment which 
the American people approve as shown in purchasing at a high price 
the few lines from the great orator which il have just read to you. 

Joaquin Miller, the poet of the Sierras, paid one of the finest 
tributes to the Latter-day Saints that has been paid to them, in his 



116 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



"Roundelay of Salt Lake," and apologized for some disparaging 
words that he had written against them in earlier years. He said of 
the pioneers of the middle west : 

"But I say to you there is nothing in the pages of history so glorious, so 
entirely grand, as the lives of these noble Spartan fathers and mothers of 
Americans, who begot and brought forth and bred the splendid giants of the 
generation that is now fast following the setting sun of their unselfish and all 
immortal lives." 

I thought this morning in the M. I. A. gathering when I witnessed 
those splendid young people coming forth from that meeting, and 1 
knew there were many thousands more in the Church of like people, 
of what Professor Roswell H. Johnson said concerning us. Among 
the many good things that were given to us during the past year or 
two, he said this in reference to our Church : 

"The eugenic situation in Mormonism is better than in other cults, because 
the Church has made, in its young people's organizations, a definite and system- 
atic effort to teach better mate selection. This effort is superior to that of any 
other cult known to me. 

"The Church is extraordinarily solicitous to provide buildings largely for 
the joint social use of the young men's and young women's societies, and to 
promote outdoor activities, to foster such companionship. In fact, in the 
Mormon Church every young person is provided a wider acquaintance with 
eligibles of the other sex than is to be found in any other cult known to me." 

So last evening in meeting those splendid young missionaries I 
thought what a happy mating it would be if some of those young people, 
now that they had completed their missionary work, would begin mating. 
The young men would be assured of very noble and pure women and 
the same thing on the part of the young women, they would be assured 
noble men. I have congratulated some of those young people who 
have married since they returned. 

We in the Canadian Mission are happily very close to the real 
shrines of the Church. I have often thought what other sects would 
do if they had a spot where the prophet of the living God was born 
and one where a sacred record was delivered to him, his boyhood 
home and the sacred grove where the Father and the Son appeared to 
him. 

These young people in assembling at Vermont where we met in 
conference for the first time this year were very greatly exhilerated 
by the beautiful spirit of peace and of love which pervaded those places 
which are recorded as sacred precincts. The grounds are very beautiful 
and well kept by Brother Smith and his family, and the neighbors from 
surrounding places came there and listened attentively and respectfully 
to the things that were presented. The reactions that we got from our 
missionaries in having the privilege of going to the place where they re- 
alize that the prophet of this dispensation was born, the grove where he 
offered the prayer that brought to him the Father and the Son, the 
sacred hill where a volume of scripture was brought forth, and the 
place where that record was translated, all those things help to impress 
the testimony of the Gospel upon our young people. 



ELDER CHARLES H. HART 



117 



I must not talk longer. I might read you some of the expressions 
of these young people who had the privilege recently, of visiting some 
of these places. We held conference for the first time at the monument 
in Vermont. They all testify of the strengthening of their testimonies 
and thank the Lord that they have had the privilege of standing on 
what they regard as sacred ground. 

I know there are other shrines of other denominations within the 
limits of our territory, but I know of none of them that claims the 
distinction of having a place where a prophet of the living God was 
born or where an angel of God appeared or where God the Eternal 
Father and his Son Jesus Christ appeared. May we treasure these 
sacred memories, I ask in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I asked for a list to be furnished me of people prominent in the 
Church who had passed away since our last Conference. I am sur- 
prised to find that the name of P. Rulon Christensen, president of the 
French Mission, was omitted. He filled a very splendid mission and 
we are grateful for his fine labors. We extend our sympathy to his 
family. 

I am also surprised that I myself did not think of one of the 
general officers of the Church, one of the assistant historians, Brother 
Junius F. Wells, the instrument in the hands of our Heavenly Father, 
by direction of President Brigham Young, of traveling all over the 
Church and establishing the Young Men's Mutual Improvement As- 
sociation. It fell to my lot to be one of the officers of the first Mutual 
Improvement Association of the young men, organized by Brother 
Wells. Three of the four officers are living today, Counselor B. Morris 
Young, Hyrum H. Goddard, the Secretary, and myself. Henry A. 
Woolley, the President, has passed away. 

I was intimately associated as a partner in business and in a 
church capacity with Junius F. Wells, nearly all of my life. I never 
heard him speak an unkind word of anyone. If he could not speak 
good of people he said nothing. He did us honor and credit wherever 
he traveled at home or abroad. He was a worthy son of a worthy 
father. His heart and soul were wrapped up in Mutual Improvement 
work. He gave to that work the very best that was in him. It is a 
source of regret to me that I could not be present at his funeral. May 
the blessings of the Lord attend his family. 

PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 

First Counselor in \the First Presidency 

Before beginning my remarks I desire to express the gratitude 
I feel this afternoon that my life has been prolonged and the privilege 
granted me of meeting again with this vast congregation of Latter-day 
Saints, these people of American birth, people of English birth, people 
from the 'Scandinavian countries, people from that wonderful nation, 



118 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Germany, people from France, and from the islands of the sea. It is a 
miracle of the ages that these representative people are gathered to- 
gether, baptized into one faith, bound together by a single brotherhood 
where the prejudices of the past may be forgotten, and they have 
become one in the service of the Lord, looking steadfastly forward 
for the coming and establishment of the kingdom of Christ his Son. 

I have opened the Bible at the scripture to which Brother J. Golden 
Kimball called our attention at the beginning of the Conference. The 
Lord here tells us that when a man speaks in the name of the Lord, 
if the thing follow not nor come to pass, it is evident that the man 
spoke presumptuously and without authority. It conversely follows 
that if a man prophesies and the words which he uttters come true 
he is a true prophet. 

NEWSPAPER HEADLINES 

A few weeks ago, unfolding the morning paper, as it is my custom 
to do before going to my daily tasks, I read the following headlines : 
"Jobless Fire Idaho Forests ; idle men start blazes in order to procure 
work; one thousand acres of timber on fire." "Rebels begin rule in 
Argentina, after battle in streets. Government quits after rebellion 
takes many lives. Argentine Army and Navy mutiny." "Santo Do- 
mingo made shambles by storm. Deaths near two thousand. Damage 
set at twenty millions of dollars." 

The following morning the paper reported four thousand bodies, 
victims of the tornado which had swept the city, had been cremated. 
The same paper contained a map designating the parts of Brazil, 
Argentina and Peru which were in open rebellion to their governments, 
in South America, and told us that nearer home, in Illinois, a party 
of American men and women, returning from an evening spent at a 
theater were held up and robbed of one hundred and thirty thousand 
dollars. 

On my desk, at the same time was a local paper which gave notice 
to the people of the city and state that a defaulting employee who had 
been arrested, charged with having embezzled one thousand dollars 
from his employer, was released by the police department, after the 
gamblers of the city, to whom he had lost the embezzled money, had 
been assessed and returned the money which the defaulter had lost to 
them, with the threat that if they refused their gambling dens would 
be closed. It logically follows that if they complied with the demand 
made they would receive protection and be permitted to continue their 
nefarious occupation. 

signs of Christ's coming 

Contemplating these occurrences and those of the past six months, 
since the last General Conference of the Church was held, my mind 
reverted to the words of Christ our Lord uttered just prior to his be- 
trayal, trial and crucifixion. As Jesus came out from the temple at 
Jerusalem his disciples called his attention to the manner of construe- 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W,. IVINS 



119 



tion of the buildings and the great stones which the workmen had placed 
in the walls. The Redeemer answered them saying: 

"Seest thou these great "buildings? There shall not be left one stone upon 
another, that shall not be thrown down." 

Passing on to the Mount of Olives his disciples spoke to him 
privately saying: 

"Tell us when these things shall be? And what shall be the sign of thy 
coming, and of the end of the World? 

"And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you. 
. "For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive 
many." 

And then he went on to tell them that it would be at a time when 
they would hear of wars and rumors of wars, that nation would rise 
against nation, and kingdom against kingdom ; that there would be 
famine and pestilences and earthquakes in divers places. 

He declared that Jerusalem would be trodden down by the Gentiles 
and her people scattered, but with the assurance that at a period desig- 
nated as the latter days, when the times of the Gentile nations would 
be fulfilled, they would be gathered again and restored to the heritage 
promised by the Lord to their father Abraham. 

He declared that prior to his coming to assume dominion over the 
earth upon which we dwell the fulness of the Gospel which he taught 
and exemplified in his life, would be restored to earth and carried to all 
nations, kindreds, tongues and people; that those whom he would call 
would go into all the world, calling the people back to faith in a living- 
God, and service to him who created the heavens and the earth, the 
sea and the fountains of water, and warning them that the hour had 
come when the righteous judgments of an offended God, whom they had 
ceased to serve, whom they defy, and whose holy name they blaspheme, 
had come. ; 

He declared that after testimony of the restoration had been borne 
by the faithful witnesses whom he would choose, he would speak to 
the people of the world by the voice of thunderings, and the voice of 
lightnings, and of tempests and the waves of the sea heaving themselves 
beyond their bounds, and earthquakes which would cause men to fall 
to the ground and not be able to stand. It was to be a time of com- 
motion which would bring perplexity and distress to the nations, such 
as the world had never known. "And then shall they see the Son of 
Man coming in power and great glory." 

Nearly twenty centuries have passed since the declarations to which 
I have referred were made. It cannot be claimed by critics, as is so 
often the case, that there is an error in dates, and that the declarations 
were made after the events referred to had occurred. 

FULFILMENT FOLLOWS 

Now, what of the fulfilment ? 

The spot upon which the temple of Solomon was to be erected 



120 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



was designated by the Prophet Gad. It was built at Jerusalem, upon 
Mount Moriah, said to be the place where Abraham built the altar 
upon which Isaac was to be offered a sacrifice to the Lord. At least 
150,000 men were employed in the construction of the temple. It was 
without doubt the most expensive, elaborate and richly adorned edifice 
erected up to the time of its construction, about a thousand years before 
the birth of Christ. Gold was used lavishly in its adornment, at least 
seven million dollars' worth as we count values. 

The temple was desecrated and a large portion of its priceless 
adornment carried away by the armies of Egypt and the kings of Israel, 
after the Ten Tribes had revolted. It was finally destroyed by Ne- 
buchadnezzar, the great king, at the time the Jews were carried into 
captivity to Babylon, about 600 years before the birth of Christ. The 
Bible tells us that he carried away all the treasures of the house of 
the Lord and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold which Solomon the 
king had made in the temple of the Lord. 

It was about eighty-seven years later, after the fall of the Baby- 
lonian kingdom to the Medo-Persian armies, that Cyrus, the Persian 
king, issued a proclamation granting permission to those of the Jews 
who desired to do so to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the temple 
which had been destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar. 

A large number of Jewish families availed themselves of this op- 
portunity and under the leadership of Zerubbabel and others returned to 
Jerusalem, rebuilt the temple and restored the ritual which had been 
established there by King Solomon. 

After the conquest of the Medo-Persian kingdom by Alexander of 
Macedon, known as Alexander the Great, the Greek general Artiochus 
Epiphanes, took the city of Jerusalem by storm, put many of the 
inhabitants to death, profaned the temple, and dedicated it to the idol- 
atrous worship of Jupiter Olympus. 

Forty years before the birth of Christ, Herod the Great became 
king of Judea. He was an Idumean or Edamite by birth, a descendant 
of Abraham through Isaac, being descended from Esau, his eldest son, 
and was not in sympathy with the Jewish people, or their religion, 
but through the influence of Rome had become the titular king of 
Judea. It was this man who ordered the slaughter of the children, after 
the birth of Christ, in order to remove one whom he feared might seek 
to succeed to the throne which he occupied. 

He undertook the restoration of the temple on a far more elaborate 
plan than any builder who had preceded him in so far as size and sub- 
stantial construction were concerned, but not with the priceless em- 
bellishment which Solomon had lavished upon it. He declared that he 
would build it so strong that it would never again be destroyed. This 
construction was in progress at the birth of Christ, and was finished 
during his ministry. 

During the war of the Maccabees, when the Maccabaeus brothers, 
Jonathan, Judas and Simon sought to throw off the yoke which the 
government established by Alexander the Great had fastened upon 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IV INS 



121 



them, ambassadors were sent to Rome with a petition to the senate 
asking for support in their wars with the Greeks. 

The petition was regarded with favor, and a treaty entered into by 
which Rome pledged herself to come to the aid of the Jews, and the 
latter agreed to assist Rome against her enemies in case of need. Rome 
notified Greece that if her oppression of the Jews did not cease at once 
she would make war upon her both by land and by sea. The text of this 
treaty, which is available, was written upon plates of brass, and sent 
to Jerusalem. One of the few instances where a message was written 
upon metal plates in ancient times. As a result of this treaty Palestine 
became a Roman province, and remained so until after the birth and 
crucifixion of our Lord. 

This was the condition at Jerusalem at the time Jesus made the 
statements regarding the destruction of the temple to which I have 
referred. 

Jewish and Roman thought were incompatible, and in A. D. 66, 
thirty years after the crucifixion, a general revolt against Rome oc- 
curred, and the Jews took possession of Jerusalem. 

Vespasian and his son Titus were sent with a Roman army to bring 
them back into submission, and after a siege which continued about 
four years, one of the most frightful and atrocious sieges of history, 
characterized by unspeakable horrors, the city was taken by Titus, who 
burned the temple, leveled the city to the ground and scattered the 
Jewish people to the four corners of the earth. Historians tell us 
that the very foundation stones were dug up by the Romans in the 
hope that treasure might be found buried there. 

THREE CENTURIES LATER 

It is said that the Roman emperor, Julian, three centuries later, in 
his hatred of Christianity, which had become the dominant religion of 
his country, seeking to restore the pagan worship, sought to rebuild the 
temple at Jerusalem, but met with so many obstacles, some of which 
appeared to be supernatural, abandoned the undertaking and returned 
to Rome with the statement: "The Nazarene has triumphed." 

I have gone briefly over the history of the past in order to bring 
before you, my brethren and sisters, the undeniable evidence that the 
words uttered by Christ our Lord, in which he declared the destruction 
of the temple at Jerusalem and the scattering of the Jews have been 
literally fulfilled. 

SIGNIFICANCE OF SCRIPTURE 

You may ask, what relationship to us has this scripture to which 
I have called attention? We who are assembled here, members of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, gathered in conference 
nearly two thousand years after the events referred to occurred. 

It has very great significance, my brethren and sisters, and it is 
for that reason that I have called your attention to it. It tells us how 
unchangeable and certain is the fulfilment of the words of the Lord 
as he has uttered them through his servants the prophets. 



122 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



The fulfilment of prophecy came in the past and generally comes 
through such natural means that we hardly observe it or know that it 
is coming. And so I feel that there are many others of the declara- 
tions of the prophets to which I might turn, the fulfilment of which 
is before our very eyes, and almost without our knowledge or attention. 

LIGHT AND KNOWLEDGE 

Seventy years have passed away since I became a member of the 
Church by baptism. During that period of time there has radiated 
from the presence of God our Father a dispensation of light, increasing 
knowledge and intelligence, which is the glory of God, to a degree 
never before known, nor even dreamed of by our fathers. 

WHth these increased conveniences and blessings which have come 
to us, there should have been manifested in our lives both by example 
and precept, greater faith in and service to our Father who is in 
heaven, who is the author of all these blessings. 

I ask you, my brethren and sisters, and with you I ask the 
Christian world at large, has this been the case? Are we a better 
people in our morals ? Do we observe with greater reverence the Sabbath 
day to keep it holy? Do we revere the name of the Lord and hold it 
more sacred because of his increased blessings? Have we become less 
selfish and grasping after wealth? Do we think more of the poor and 
unfortunate, or do we in our hurried struggle of life forget them and 
leave them to suffer while we live surrounded with abundance? Do 
we love and serve our country more, and more devotedly honor its laws ? 

I leave you to answer these questions. 

VISIT TO ST. GEORGE 

A short time ago, in company with President Grant, I visited my 
old home at St. George. Early in the morning before it was light, I 
rose and walked out to the little cemetery and stood by the graves of 
my parents. As the light increased I walked down the narrow streets 
and read the inscriptions on the tombstones. I remembered every one 
of the men and women whose names were inscribed upon them. T 
thought of them all and could remember something in their lives — 
every one from the humblest to the most honored — which had led me 
to love and honor them. 

I knew these men as I have known no others. I knew the sacrifices 
which they had made, that they had given all they had to give- for an 
ideal. I had seen them face danger with the courage of Spartans, 
and perform acts of mercy with the gentleness of women, and when their 
mortal race was run and they were face to face with death, meet it 
with the sublime resignation of martyrs. 

They had been my teachers, the guardians of my youth. They 
taught me faith in a living God, that he is the same good Heavenly 
Father that he ever was, and will watch over and bless all those who 
put their trust in him. They taught me that birth into this life was not 
the beginning of my existence nor death the end of it. They taught 
me to defraud no man, though the thing may be small, They taught 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W[ IVINS 123 



me to love virtue and refrain from any habit which, when my record 
is read from the house top, as it will be, would bring the blush of 
shame to my cheek. They taught me to love my country and honor 
and obey its laws ; that the government under which it is my privilege 
to live is a God-given heritage, and that it was my duty to defend it 
against all enemies, be they foreign or domestic, if necessary at the 
cost of life itself. 

A SILENT PRAYER 

As I stood there in the gray dawn, in that silent city of the dead, 
I breathed a silent prayer of thanksgiving to my Father in heaven 
that my lot had been cast with these humble, God-fearing men and 
women, and prayed that as I had been with them and served them in 
mortal life, so might I be with them for service in the life to come. 
And I knew that if I proved my devotion to the truth as they proved 
theirs that my prayer would be answered. 

I desire to say to you, my brethren and sisters, that had I been 
brought into any other cemetery within the boundaries of this state 
and walked there and communed with the people who have given their 
lives for this same ideal I would have found exactly the same condition. 

EARLY DAY FIDELITY 

I could not refrain, and that was what led me to quote from 
these daily papers as I did in the beginning of my remarks, from draw- 
ing the contrast between the conditions which existed at the time when 
the example and influence of these men dominated the politics of this 
State and those which exist today, if we are to believe the reports which 
come to us through the daily press of the country. 

I do not remember an instance where an innocent man was con- 
victed of wrongdoing, or where a known criminal escaped punishment. 
There were no men in the State prison who had violated the trust re- 
posed in them by their fellow citizens who had elected them to office, 
nor men out of prison who, if justice were administered, would be inside. 
Men were taught that public office was a public trust and must be ad- 
ministered with fidelity and honor, and they did it. I wonder what their 
reaction would be if they were here today to witness the changed 
conditions which exist in this modern world of ours, a world so different 
from that in which they lived that it can scarcely be recognized as 
belonging to the same planet upon which they lived. 

GOOD MEN NEEDED IN OFFICE 

I have no desire to go back to that day, to exchange automobiles 
for ox teams, which I have driven, nor to exchange our wonderful 
harvesting machinery for the cradle with which I have harvested grain, 
and the flail with which I threshed it. But I do appeal to you, my 
brethren and sisters, to return to the old paths of virtue, honor and 
integrity which your fathers trod. No matter what the development 
of science or of invention may bring to us these virtues remain the 



124 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



same. They are eternal truths and the advancement of our so-called 
civilization cannot change them. 

No one will deny that we are living in perilous times. No one 
who is familiar with the Scripture will deny that we are living at. the 
time when our Lord says his glorious appearance is near. 

Only the day before yesterday the press advised us that one 
million dollars was being subscribed by the lawless element in Chicago 
for the purpose of removing from office the Commissioner of Police 
because of his activities in the suppression of crime. 

If it is true that organized crime has fastened its tentacles upon 
our own city and state, as reported in the quotations which I made in 
the beginning of my remarks, is it not time that we arouse from the 
lethargy of indifferent citizenship and demand reform and see to it 
that good men and wise men are selected to control our public affairs? 

There are such men, equal to any of the past. They are to be found 
in all political parties. They are not confined to any religious or- 
ganization, but are all around us in every vocation of life. Such men 
now represent us in political life, in national, state and city affairs. 
As I know many of these men I cannot think of others for whom 
I would desire to exchange them. I regret that I cannot feel so toward 
all. 

I make no plea for any candidate, for any political party, or any 
church. But I do plead with all the people, and particularly the church, 
and I refer to all Christian people, to unitedly resolve that the sacred 
heritage bequeathed to us by our fathers be sacredly preserved, that 
this country of ours may continue to be a light to the world, reaching 
out its hands to all people, guaranteeing to all men liberty under the 
law, but license to do wrong to none. I regard it as my duty and the 
duty of every other professed Christian to assume this attitude if our 
country is to be rescued from anarchy, violence and chaos. 

My brethren and sisters, I have studied the history of the past. 
I know the story of the rise and fall of Rome, of Babylon, of Egypt, and 
of other great nations, and the one outstanding thing that brought that 
about was the corruption of the officials who were placed in charge 
of affairs of state. I do not wish to continue to quote scripture in order 
to demonstrate that we are living in a time when the Lord has said that 
these very things shall exist. But he has warned us against them. 
He has declared the destiny of this nation and of all other nations. 
I wish simply to say that if they are to persist, if they continue, it will 
be when the people return to the Lord God of heaven and in justice 
and righteousness serve him, both in civil and ecclesiastical affairs. 
And if this shall fail these very elements that have resulted in the de- 
struction of the civilizations of the past, if they shall be permitted by 
us to persist, will eventually bring to us perplexity, confusion and final 
chaos. 

God bless you, my brethren and sisters, and may he help us all to 
magnify our callings, to stand righteously for that which is right and 
immovably opposed to that which is wrong, is my prayer, and I ask 
it through Jesus Christ our Lord, Amen.

The Choir rendered the anthem, "That Sweet Story of Old," 
solo part by Cannon Lund. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

We have as usual — and this you have heard before — more speakers 
than we have time. We would like to hear from all mission presidents. 
We have the authorities to present, and we would like to hear from 
our sisters. But there is only one way we can do it, and that is to 
pull the coat tails of those who do not look at the clock, as we will 
have to limit each of them to five minutes. 

ELDER SAMUEL O. BENNION 

President of the Central State's Mission 

I have been greatly impressed during the past summer in reading 
the History of the Church which has recently been compiled by Presi- 
dent Brigham H. Roberts, and in finding therein the expressions of the 
leaders of our Church who have long since passed away. 

I commend to the men and women of this Church, especially 
the youth, the reading of that history. I hope that it may be found 
in all the homes of the people. 

Those men bear witness, and the history of them gives evidence, 
that they were in reality servants of the living God. No one could 
accomplish what Brigham Young did, and those mighty pioneers who 
were with him in the beginning of this great work in this western 
country, unless God had been with. I think we ought to become 
more familiar with the work of our people, that we may realize what it 
cost to establish the Church of God in this land. The Lord has pro- 
vided a background of history that will refute any charge that could 
be brought against this people. The historical record is wonderful 
and the doctrinal record is just as certain. The Lord selected mighty 
men, and according to the Prophet Joseph Smith, they were chosen 
before the foundations of this earth were laid, to establish his work in 
the day and age in which we live. I believe, my brethren and sisters, 
that things do not happen by chance; but that the Lord provides for 
all the things that have come to pass. Then he has placed the responsi- 
bility on his people to do their best to carry out his purposes. He gave a 
revelation in which the free agency of man is referred to as follows : 

"Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do 
many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness ; 

"For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves. And 
inasmuch as men do good they shall in nowise lose their reward." 

I bear testimony to you, my brethren and sisters, that the men who 
have stood at the head of this Church in this land from the days„of 
Brigham Young until now have been men of God and have exercised 
the privilege that God gave them, and that the Church has been sta- 
bilized and led just as though our Eternal Father had been here. For 



126 



GENERAL 'CONFERENCE 



I am convinced that Jesus Christ, who gave his life for the children 
of men, has never at any time since the organization of this Church 
been very far from it. I bear my testimony to you in the name of 
Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER JAMES H. MOYLE 

President of the Eastern States Mission 

My brethren and sisters, I am pleased to say that the missionaries 
in the Eastern States are in exceptional good health, and are perform- 
ing a splendid work. 

There is probably nothing that indicates this more, in view of the 
distressing shortage of employment, than the fact that the number of 
tithe-payers has materially increased, with about twenty-four per cent 
increase in the amount of tithing paid. In confirmation of what has 
been already said, none, so far as I know, of those who pay tithing, 
is unemployed, with one exception, and he lost his temper and quit 
his job. 

In confirmation of what President Grant has said, I can testify to 
the fact that there is a marked change taking place in the sentiment 
of the people of the country toward our people. The Church is really, 
as he said, coming into its own, and I can conceive of nothing, unless 
it be the providences of God, that has made the marvelous change 
that has taken place. Naturally, no doubt, for I believe that is the 
way the Lord works. I am sure that the organ recitals from this tab- 
ernacle have performed a marvelous work in softening the minds of 
the people and helping to bring them to a realization of the fact that 
such music does not come from a low, uncultured and base people, but 
rather those with high, noble and pure conceptions. The work too on this 
temple block, at the Bureau of Information, I believe is being very 
helpful in changing the attitude of the many travelers and tourists who 
come to Utah. They meet our people and become acquainted with 
them and their accomplishments. They constitute a great auxiliary 
force in refuting the scandalous stories that have been so frequently 
circulated about us. These people frequently manifest their friendli- 
ness toward our missionaries, as they very frequently report in our 
conferences. 

One of the most notable developments in the Mission is the changed 
attitude which has taken place toward us, particularly since the Cen- 
tennial celebration. We have comparatively little trouble in getting 
notices into the papers. They treat us well. Many of them will 
publish much that we want them to do. We gathered something over 
a thousand clippings and some of them splendid, lengthy articles, deal- 
ing fairly with our people, concerning the Centennial celebration. 

I am sure the periodicals and daily newspapers are ready to publish, 
if prepared in the right way, the most important and interesting facts 
relating to our organization, the culture "Mormonism" is developing, 
our accomplishments in matters of health, superior methods of training,

ELDER JAMES H. MOYLE

educating and developing the young; our unparalleled missionary sys- 
tem and method of developing preachers which enables the Church 
to carry on without a paid clergy, and which insures the highest per- 
centage of all church-going attendance without a paid preacher; a 
charity system, which is equally unique, not only in its completeness, 
but which is carried on so as to insure one hundred per cent of the 
money contributed gping to the charity for which it was contributed, 
without anything being deducted for collection or distribution. I know 
of no other organization in which that is accomplished. 

These are of the utm,ost interest to all thinking people interested 
in the development and progress of human welfare, and when once 
understood arouse interest in learning what is behind it all ; in other 
words, the material benefits or "fruits of Mormonism" once known 
arouse a desire to know why and from whence they come, and induce 
a study of the principles of the Gospel. 

During the last five months we have developed preaching the 
Gospel, as predicted in the Book of Mormon, from the house tops, 
or more literally over the radio free of charge in a number of large 
and prominent cities in the Mission. This is being done by young in- 
experienced missionaries. They write their own addresses and deliver 
them, first submitting 'them to us for revision. But in only a few 
cases has there been any substantial revision. Young men coming to 
the Mission at nineteen and twenty years of age. One, and I think 
the one who has led most successfully in obtaining this privilege, came 
to the Mission only twenty years of age. At first we were given only 
ten or twelve minutes in which to speak, the balance of the half hour 
to be devoted to music. Oh, if we could have more missionaries who, 
could sing! If you will furnish us with singers we will secure the 
radio for preaching the Gospel free. It was not long before the time 
was extended to a full hour in some cases, a half hour for preaching 
and a half hour for singing and music. And in all cases the time to 
preach has been extended. 

I would like to call attention to one other very interesting develop- 
ment. We are now exhibiting Mormonism in the fairs and large 
exhibitions, in which we lay special stress upon the. Word of Wisdom 
and its benefits upon our educational system, our training of the young ; 
and our charity system. We are calling attention notably to the fact 
that not a dollar is expended in collecting and distributing" funds for 
charitable purposes. 

This affords unexampled opportunities for Gospel conversations 
and the distribution of tracts by the tens of thousands. More than 
five thousand were distributed by half a dozen missionaries in one 
day from our booth in the great Eastern States Exposition recently 
held at Springfield, Massachusetts. 

The best feature of it all is the presentation of a few of our finest 
missionaries, whose very presence attracts attention and radiates the 
spirit of the Gospel of our Redeemer. 

My time is up. May the Lord help us to appreciate the great work 
in which we are engaged, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ELDER MILES L. JONES 

President of the F<ast Central States Mission 

I am very pleased, my brethren and sisters, to have the opportunity 
of visiting with you upon this occasion. I have had the privilege 
of attending every session of the Conference and I have enjoyed them 
to the fullest extent. 

I heartily endorse what was said by President Grant and President 
Moyle, also by President McMurrin, in regard to two or three items. 
President McMurrin referred to the shortage of missionaries. I was 
asked today by one brother if volunteers would be accepted. I want 
to say, brethren and sisters, if you have volunteers they should be 
recommended and called in the regular way. We can use one hundred 
of them in the East Central States Mission. 

President Grant referred to the wonderful work that is being 
done by the Choir. I can bear testimony to that because in passing 
along the streets of Louisville and other cities we find every Monday 
afternoon that those programs are being broadcast so that even the 
people in the streets are able to hear them ; and they are doing a wonder- 
ful amount of good because they make many friends for us and give 
us an opportunity to talk upon the principles of the Gospel. 

Just a few days ago we held a series of meetings in one of the 
cities close to Louisville. The next morning after holding these meet- 
ings, as my wife and I were leaving the city, we met one of our local 
brethren who remarked that he had just been talking to one of his 
neighbors who belongs to another denomination. In the course of this 
conversation he said: 

"In our services last night our minister referred to a certain class of people 
in this manner : 'There is a little community of saints here that meet together 
as a family, and they are the best people in all the world, and they have a 
prophet to lead them'." 

I want to tell you, my brethren and sisters, there is a community 
in Bath County that meet together as a family. They are among the 
best people in all the world, and they have a prophet to lead them. 
And in practically every county in this nation there are similar com- 
munities, and they are led by a prophet of God, even President Heber 
J. Grant, who stands at the head of this Church today. I know of 
his integrity. I have traveled with him, I have eaten with him, and 
I have slept with him. I know that his heart and his soul are wrapped 
up in this work, and he is God's mouthpiece upon the earth. 

May our Father's choicest blessings ever abide with each and every 
one of us, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER ARTHUR WELLING 

President of the No^th Central States Mission 

My Brethren and Sisters : I bring you the greetings of the mis- 
sionaries and saints of the North Central States Mission, all of whom 



ELDER ARTHUR WELLING

are well and enjoying their work. That the drouth, unemployment 
and the low price of wheat have produced a lean year in the semi-arid 
states of Montana, the Dakotas, and the wheat producing Canadian 
provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba, you need not be told. Min- 
nesota has fared better. But our people are not complaining. They 
are holding their own. So far we have not fallen off in tithing paid 
nor in number of converts baptized. We hope our people will continue 
their good work until times shall mend, and everything be all right again. 

We are glad to testify of the changed conditions of friendliness 
toward our people already spoken of in this Conference. An illustra- 
tion of this friendly interest, arising largely, no doubt, from attention 
given tourists on this block, from radio sermons of leading brethren, 
and from the broadcast of Tabernacle Organ and Choir recitals, may 
interest you. Within the recent past two of our capable and charm- 
ing lady missionaries have been entertained at the home of the Gov- 
ernor of one of our States, where they were graciously and cordially 
received by "the Governor's wife, for whom they sang some of the 
songs of Zion, and at whose invitation they joined in prayer before 
leaving her home. This good woman was full of praise for leading 
brethren and sisters with whom she and her husband's party had been 
associated here. The more people know about you, the better they 
receive your missionaries abroad. To be a Mormon missionary from 
Utah is no longer a reproach, but a distinction. 

It must not be inferred, however, that this friendliness implies a 
very general acceptance of the Gospel as we teach it. Not so. Men 
applaud the perfection of our Church organization, the fact that "it 
works," and that it puts tens of thousands of its people to work. The 
financial system of the Church, tithing and fast offerings, are the ad- 
miration of some and the envy of others. Our missionary system, 
and the Word of Wisdom, etc., receive commendation of intelligent 
people everywhere. But there they stop. That God the Eternal Father 
and his Son, Jesus Christ, are real personages, capable of appearing to 
men as we affirm they did to Joseph Smith in the Sacred Grove in 
western New York in 1820, few men of the world believe. If Latter- 
day Saints were willing to abandon Joseph Smith and his claims to 
seership, throw overboard the first great vision with all that it implies 
as to the actuality, and the' reality of the personality of God, the rest 
of Mormonism could • be popularized over night. Stand by these 
declarations of divine origin for our religion, and the doctrine of Deity 
inherent therein, and you stand alone, your only consolation, if such it 
be, that you stand alone with God. 

Your missionaries in the field believe in and love to testify of "God 
the Eternal Father, and of his Son, Jesus Christ, and of the Holy 
Ghost;" and that Joseph Smith was a prophet of the true and living 
God. They also believe in good men everywhere, and are grateful 
for their growing friendship. Of you, here at home, they like to think 
as "The salt of the earth." "By their fruits shall ye know them" is a 
text they love. To you they look to vindicate what they proudly boast 
as "The fruits of Mormonism."

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



"Oh ye that embark in the service of God," your missionary would 
say to you if he could, "See that ye serve him with all your heart, 
might, imind and strength, that ye may stand blameless before God 
at the last day." 

God bless the youth of Israel and the missionaries of his Church 
everywhere in the world, we humbly pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

ELDER NOAH S. POND 

President of the Northern States Mission 

I pray in my heart that we may be able to take to our homes 
in the wards and stakes and in the mission fields the spirit and instruc- 
tion of this great Conference. 

Sister Pond and I are happy in the work in the Northern States 
Mission. The auxiliary organizations and the Aaronic Priesthood, I 
believe, are being properly supervised and more than ordinary progress 
is being made. As a Church and as missionaries representing the 
Savior in the mission field, we cannot but acknowledge the eternal 
fitness of these men, times and occurrence of things, just as Columbus 
was led to discover the new world, although his reward was the return 
to the old country in chains. Just as John Milton was led to the steps 
of the palace of Whitehall Chapel three hundred years ago with his 
plea for "Liberty of the press," although diplomacy drove him into 
seclusion and exile. A courtier at the court told him that one of two 
things would happen, he would either be locked up in the castle or 
lose his head. But the intellectual germ of Milton's "Plea" fell into 
the hands of Englishmen, Frenchmen, Germans, Scotchmen, Yankees, 
Turks, Japs and Russians ; and liberty and freedom were born and 
realized. Galileo, Luther and Washington are further examples of the 
eternal fitness of men and messages. 

Joseph Smith, God's great prophet, came in the right century and 
to the right nation and country. He could not so successfully have 
delivered his message in an earlier century or in another country. 
And these things are marvelous in contemplation, but we see our 
Father's regulatory and supervisory guidance of time and events for 
the benefit of his people. 

I am happy to testify of the truth of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. 
I am happy to have the privilege of testifying to the people of the 
earth. God bless our leaders today and all who follow. May we have 
that testimony of the Gospel, the richest gift of God, that will ultimately 
lead us into the kingdom of our Father and bring us eternal life, is 
my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER WILLIAM R. SLOAN 

President of the Northwestern States Mission 

Since our last Conference it has been my happy pleasure to go 
on the streets of Portland one evening and witness a street meeting 



ELDER WILLIAM R. SLOAN 



131 



being held by the missionaries there. Sister Ada Strong of Salt Lake 
City was speaking and gave a most excellent discourse on the divine 
mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith. A well-dressed gentleman walked 
into the crowd and stood right near my side. He said in an undertone 
voice, loud enough that I could hear what he was saying : "There they 
are, telling the same old story, and there is nothing to it." 

I wish that gentleman were here today. I wish that he could wit- 
ness this vast gathering of men and women, the cream of the earth, 
and I wonder if he could then make such a statement. I wish that 
he might hear this wonderful choir that we have listened to today with 
so much pleasure and interest, I wish he could hear this world-famed 
organ of ours ; and I wonder if he then could say there is nothing to 
this work. 

Is it possible, brethren and sisters and friends, that a young man 
such as Joseph Smith was, with five colleagues, one hundred years 
ago — these boys as they were, all under thirty-one years of age, six 
of them together in a room — could effect and establish an organization 
out of which has grown a Church that today stands the marvel of the 
world? It is ridiculous to think that, brethren and sisters, in the light 
that this man thought of it. So I want to give you that thought today. 

I am happy to contemplate the words of men like the grand old 
man known as the Dean of American Education, Dr. Winship, who 
said that Utah stands positively in the forefront of all the States of 
the Union in her activities for the saving of the youth. He said that 
he had praised Utah and the Mormons in every State of the Union, 
and had never had anything to apologize for. 

Dr. Nixon Carver said : 

"I have never found more sound and wholesome personal habits than among 
the Mormons ; I have never mingled with a people who showed fewer signs 
of dissipation; I have never studied groups of people who seemed better 
nourished and more healthful ; I have never known of a people who took greater 
pains to educate their children." "This gives a clue to the success of the 
Mormons as colonizers and Nation Builders." "I have studied the philosophy 
of the world, both ancient and modern, but the greatest of all philosophies 
is the philosophy of Mormonism." 

George Wharton James, an American writer, said: 

"The boy Joseph Smith was but a hundred years ahead of his time. Yet, 
he being dead yet speaketh. The work he began has never ceased. Who can 
explain Joseph Smith? What is their test? Is it not beyond all reason that a 
lad, born of poor parents, devoid of any save the commonest education, too poor 
to buy books, should have accomplished what he did in less than forty years, 
unless there was some great reason for it?" 

"Let anyone, even a literary genius after forty years of life, try to write 
a companion volume to the Book of Mormon and then almost daily fpr a 
number of years give out 'revelations' by the score that internally harmonize 
one with another, at the same time formulate a system of doctrine for a new 
church, introduce many new priniciples, resuscitate extinct priesthoods, and 
formulate a system of church government which has no superior on earth." 

"To deny to such a man wonderful power over the human heart and intellect 
is absurd. Only fanatical prejudice can ignore it. However he may be accounted 



132 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



for by the reasoning mind, Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet was one of the 
wonders of his time." 

Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the great novelist and spiritualist, said 
he believed that Joseph Smith was a true medium. 

Many of the notables whom I could mention are just as loud in 
their praise and have a true appreciation of this wonderful Church and 
its organization. 

I remember a year ago listening to the words of President Nibley 1 
when he said among other things, "Brethren, make sacrifices for mis- 
sions." I would like to tell you just one instance that has come to 
pass in my own observation. 

Two boys from a nearby Stake, brothers they were, both received 
calls to go on missions. Their father was in poor circumstances and 
had a heavy mortgage on his property. He was unable to even pay 
the interest that had accumulated for a number of years. These boys 
willingly accepted the call and came to Salt Lake City. One of them 
was called to the Southern States and the other to the Northwestern 
States. After they had attended the mission school for two weeks 
the older boy said : "Brother, we have only twenty dollars between us, 
not enough to take us both to our fields of labor. You take this money 
and go to the Northwest, and I shall go back home and help father on 
the farm." 

The younger brother said : "No, brother, you are the older, you 
go." But the older remonstrated, and said, "No, you shall go." And 
finally the younger boy took the twenty dollars and came to the North- 
west. The first thing he knew his brother had not gone home, but 
had gone to the Southern States. And these two boys are in the field 
today. Last year that good father not only was blessed by having 
two sons in the mission field, but his finances were such that he paid all 
of the back interest on the mortgage, and he was able to make a 
substantial payment on the principal of the mortgage on the property. 

God bless you. The missionaries in the Northwest, I think, are as 
happy as young men and young women could be. I want to say that 
the Lord has greatly favored me and blessed me in my association with 
the leaders of this Church, and I love, respect and admire them. And 
I am blessed in the wonderful companionship that I have with one of 
the sweetest companions in all the world. She too is enjoying her 
work in the mission. I pray God's blessings to be with you and with 
us, that we shall continue onward and upward with this work unto 
the perfect day, which I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

SISTER LOUISE Y. ROBISON 

President of the Relief Society 

In an address given by our dear President Grant in Relief Society 
Conference last Thursday afternoon, he said, "I have no fear for the 
Church .of Jesus Christ as long as the women of the Church are de- 
voted to its principles." This implies a great responsibility, also a 



SISTER LOUISE Y, ROB I SON

challenge to Us to analyze ourselves and find if we are meeting the 
requirements. 

Attention has been called most forcibly by speakers in this Con- 
ference to the disregard of law by the people of the United States. 
This should be the concern of every mother, and she should ask wherein 
she can help correct this situation. 

A simple suggestion would be to avoid criticism of any person 
in authority, either civil or religious, before our children. It is an 
easy matter to cause distrust in their minds. They have not the phil- 
osophy to reason things out and the world is insecure to them. Un- 
fortunately when we break down the confidence of our children in 
those holding authority, it is not long before the advice of parents is 
questioned. 

The cause of prohibition, in which we are so interested, is often 
weakened by the comments made in the home. If a parent, in whom 
the child has confidence, criticizes an enforcement officer or expresses 
the opinion that the law can never be enforced, the effect it must have 
on young people is soon apparent. Wje must remember that the men 
and women of the future will be only as strong as we help our boys 
and girls to be in our homes. 

Speaking of prohibition, only last summer I heard the Commis- 
sioner of Education of Idaho, speaking in defense of prohibition, 
declare that it is a mistake to say there is more drinking among business 
men now than formerly. He referred to a group of Union Pacific 
men who met in Nebraska less than twenty years ago, and before the 
first evening was over there were few men who had not been drinking. 
Approximately this same group met in Denver within the last two years. 
Mr. Gray, the president, heard there were four men who were drinking. 
He found them, put them on the train and sent them homej dismissed 
from the company. 

I have a testimony that this is the Church of God, that the Prophet 
Joseph Smith really did have his mission given him by our Father in 
heaven. May all mothers have the Spirit of God to be with them that 
they may never say anything unlovely or unworthy ! May we, as 
Latter-day Saint mothers, ever be true to the covenants we have made, 
I ask in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

SISTER RUTH MAY FOX 

President of the Young Ladies' Mutual Improvement Association 

My brethren and sisters, last Sunday evening I attended a mis- 
sionary farewell. The young man was quite bashful and while he 
was getting up he heard a dog bark on the outside. So he opened 
his remarks by saying, "How I envy that dog!" 

I have been feeling that to be in a comfortable chair by the radio 
at home would be a very happy condition. However I realize that I 
am not standing before you because of any merit of my own, but I am 
here to represent my counselors and the young ladies of my board and 



134 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



about twelve thousand splendid officers in the Young Ladies' Mutual 
Improvement Association. 

I am very proud and happy to stand here and represent them. In 
that capacity I would like to remind the audience that one of the books 
on our reading course this year is "The Life of the Prophet Joseph 
Smith," written by our late Brother George Q. Cannon. ;We feel sure 
that if you will read it and encourage your family to read it your sym- 
pathies will be renewed for the founders of this Church and your faith 
will be increased. 

This morning as I sat in this great congregation I felt that it was a 
very great privilege and blessing to be one of the ten thousand who were 
here assembled. I testify to you that the words that have fallen from 
the lips of the brethren who have spoken from this stand have been 
verily the words of God, given to us by the voice of his servants, and 
so I think I cannot do better than to remind you of the Savior's words 
when he said : 

"Whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them, I will liken 
him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock; 

"And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat 
upon that house; and it fell not; for it was founded upon a rock. 

-"And everyone that heareth of these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, 
shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand ; 

"And the rain descended and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat 
upon that house; and it fell; and great was the fall of it." 

My brethren and sisters, you and I are building our houses upon 
the rock. May God help us to build them so strong that no matter 
how hard" the winds may blow or the rains descend our houses shall 
never fall. God grant it in the name of Jesus, Amen. 

SISTER MAY ANDERSON 

General Superintendent of the Primary Association 

This splendid Conference would not be entirely complete without 
reporting that the children of this Church are being cared for, that the 
children's organization, the Primary Association, has about one hundred 
thousand members, with about ten thousand women who are all striving 
to help in the work of prevention rather than the work of cure. 

The Church asks us to teach the children the principles of the 
Gospel, to take care of their leisure time activities, and to bear in mind 
that every boy and girl born in the Church has the right to a strong 
body, that he and she may make their way in the world as fairly as 
possible. 

For the religious instruction we are using the Articles of our Faith, 
and we think it the greatest code of moral conduct that was ever pro- 
duced. As we are using it we shall probably send into the homes of the 
people of the Church thousands of little cards bearing the Articles of 
Faith. 

For the supervision of the leisure time activities of the children 



SISTER MAY ANDERSON 



135 



we are providing safe and sane activities that will give them joy and 
pleasure, that will help them to be happy and good. 

In our labors for the health of the children of the Church we use 
that wonderful blessing, that divine revelation, that has been given 
to us, the Word of Wisdom. In our health program we include a 
hospital where we hope to take care of any boy or girl who needs med- 
ical or surgical aid and whose parents are not able to provide the 
necessary care. 

Now, how shall we connect up with you, my brethren and sisters, 
to put this thing over splendidly? I am happy for this opportunity 
to say that we hope the Bishops will stand with us in helping to get 
the boys ready for the Priesthood. We hope the Mutuals will stand with 
us in getting the boys ready for Scouting. We hope that every home 
in this Church will stand with us to provide the right foundation. We 
shall plead, and we hope not in vain, that there will foe no home in our 
Church where boys and girls will know anything about liquor. We hope 
there will be no home-made wine in any home in our Church. We 
hope there will be no coffee, no tea, no tobacco. We plead with you, 
my brethren and sisters, to make life safe for the fooys and girls. 
Prevention is eminently better than cure. There is nothing that is 
more favorable nor better than the home. We can only add to what 
you do. 

One other thing that we are doing and have been doing for a long 
time is to persuade the people of our Church that activities for boys 
and girls should be in the daytime and that there should not be any 
inducement offered to our youngsters to be out at night. Night is 
dangerous, and when boys and girls go out on the streets away from 
their fathers and mothers no one can tell what is happening. We hear 
some strange stories, and we are saying to you with all the ardor of 
our beings that we want you fathers and mothers to stand with us 
to make this world safe for our boys and girls. 

Let us live the Word of Wisdom in what we eat and what we drink 
and also in the way in which we take care of the time God has given 
us. That you will stand for the finest homes in the world, for the finest 
children from such homes, and that the Primary Association may be 
indeed a real help in the Church, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, 
Amen.

PRIMARY ASSOCIATION 



138 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



It has been remarkable. I am thankful for the rich outpouring of 
the Spirit of the Lord. I am grateful for the splendid singing that 
we have listened to and for all of the inspired remarks that have 
been made; particularly am I thankful for the splendid testimonies 
averaging from three to five minutes — all kept within the time. I am 
very grateful indeed for these testimonies. I wish we had time to 
hear them at greater length, but the simple declaration of a knowledge 
of the divinity of this work from the men and women who stand 
at the head of the missionary work and the auxiliary associations in 
this Church is a source of great satisfaction, and these testimonies 
cannot be denied. No matter whether people believe them or not, those 
of us who have the inspiration of the Spirit of the Lord know that 
they are true, because we have that same testimony ourselves. 

I did not make any remarks at the close of the last Conference 
because the time had expired. But I have made up my mind that in 
the future even if the time has expired I am going to say a" few 
things that are in my mind. 

APPRECIATION OF ELDER ROBERTS' WORK 

I want to express my gratitude, my thanks, my love and my 
blessing to Brother Brigham H. Roberts for the marvelous and inspiring 
energy that he has put forth in producing the six great volumes of 
the history of this Church. It is a monumental labor and he has 
worked at it day and night. I know of no man who has been more 
diligent in his labors for the Church, day in and day out, than Brother 
Roberts has been preparing this great history, and he has the gratitude 
of all the brethren of the Presidency and the Apostles for the diligence, 
the great care and attention that he has given to the production of these 
volumes. He is still busily engaged, more perfectly arranging the 
indexes, etc., for the history. I rejoice in this wonderful accomplish- 
ment. 

GRATITUDE FOR WORK OF CHOIR 

I was thrilled by the United States Marine band concert that was 
held in this building recently. I enjoyed it very much. But the real 
thrill came when I heard the two selections that were rendered by our 
Choir. I have never heard our sweet singer, Sister Laurinda P. 
Brewerton, who sang the solo part in "Inflammatus," sing better at any 
time than she did on that occasion. It seemed to me that she was 
inspired. I know that the band must have been inspired. 

I rejoice in the broadcasting. I repeat the gratitude of the General 
Authorities to the employers of the members of our Choir who are 
excused each week in order to participate in this broadcast. 

BLESSING AND TESTIMONY 

I wanted to say this much, and I want to leave my blessing upon 
all the General Authorities, the General Officers, the Presidents of 
Stakes, the Bishops of Wards, the Presidents of Branches, Presidents 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



139 



of Missions and all men and women in any place of responsibility in 
this Church. They have my love, my confidence and my blessing, also 
the blessing of my Counselors. I leave my blessing upon all Israel, 
and upon all honest people the world over. I thank God that I know 
he lives, that I know that Jesus Christ is the Redeemer of the world, 
and that Joseph Smith was a prophet of the true and living God, and 
all the doubt of all the world cannot change the knowledge that God 
has given to me and to the Latter-day Saints by the hundreds of thou- 
sands. May God's blessings attend you all, I ask, in the name of 
Jesus, our Redeemer, Amen. 

The anthem, "Worthy the Lamb," was rendered by the Choir. 
President Anthony W. Ivins pronounced the benediction. 
Conference adjourned for six months. 

Prof. Anthony C. Lund conducted the singing at all of the sessions 
of the Conference. Edward P. Kimball and Frank Asper played the 
accompaniments, interludes, etc., on the great organ. 

Stenographic reports of the discourses were made by Frank W. 
Otterstrom and Joseph Anderson.

All Students of the Book of 
Mormon 

WILL FIND THE BOOK 

An Introduction to the Study of 
the Book of Mormon 

By J. M. SJODAHL 

To be mighty interesting and illuminating 

"Some of the contents of the book has appeared in the IMPROVEMENT ERA and 
other Church publications during: the last ten years, and friends have been good 
enough to say, repeatedly* that they would be glad to have those contributions in some 
form more convenient for reference. Acting on their suggestion, I have collected 
some papers previously published and others that now appear for the first time, and 
respectfully submit them in this form to the public. In doing so, it is my sincere 
prayer that the testimony here offered may be of benefit to the reader, and especially 
to honest seekers after the truth."

"Time is the supreme test of a prophecy. He who undertakes to foretell 
events must know that Time in its merciless pursuit will find him out. Of all the 
pretenses of the false prophet, prophesying is the most hazardous. Religious impostors 
often display qualities of leadership in controlling the affairs of their followers. The 
more modest their pretenses, however, the more likely are they to escape detection 
and exposure. But when spiritual leaders assume to exercise the exalted function 
of prophecy, and have the courage to publish their prophecies, they place their reputa- 
tions before the bar of the world, and as the weight of Time presses out the vintage 
of the centuries they must sink to a deserving oblivion or be exalted to a place in the 
skies. Time is a foe of Fraud, but the never-failing friend of Truth." 

Now that the claims of Joseph Smith as prophet have been set up before the 
world for a century, it is proper that the verdict of Time should be ascertained. To 
disclose these findings, this volume is given out. Only a few of the well-known 
prophecies are here considered. 

All this is clearly set forth in

A veritable epic of empire -building 

The Life Story of 
Brigham Young 

By SUSA YOUNG GATES AND LEAH D. WIDTSOE 
WITH A FOREWORD BY HONORABLE REED SMOOT 

"This book presents the life story of a New England cabinet-maker, 
who, well into his thirties, entered upon a career that made him an empire- 
builder of the West; the founder of a hundred cities; the governor of one 
of the territories of the United States; and one of the outstanding figures 
of the nineteenth century." 

Thus does Senator Smoot begin his enthusiastic foreword to this 
notable biography. "A graphic, gripping story," he terms it, and every 
reader undoubtedly will agree with his definition of this life of the in- 
defatigable, indomitable Brigham Young, which was written by one of his 
daughters and her daughter. The entire record of the great Mormon 
leader is unfolded from his birth in a little Vermont town to his death at 
the age of seventy-seven as head of the church, the success of which was due 
to his courageous and arduous leadership.

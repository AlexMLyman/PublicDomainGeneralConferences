ONE HUNDRED THIRD 



(^Annual Qonference 

OF THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST 
OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS 



Held in the Tabernacle

April 6, 7, 9, 1933 

With Report of Discourses

A THRILLING STORY 

of Century One of 

CHURCH HISTORY 

ERE is a new story of "Mormpnism," told with a com- 
pleteness and charm that will thrill Latter-day Saints 
with a pride of achievement and at the same time 
win the admiration of the critic, be he friend or foe. In a 
COMPREHENSIVE HISTORY OF THE CHURCH, B. H. 
Roberts has done a masterful piece of research and has set 
down the record of Century One — 1830 to 1930 — in a bril- 
liant appraisal of momentous events. The reader with a 
sentimental interest will be fascinated with this narrative 
of truth stranger than fiction; the reader who approaches 
the new work with the critical vision of the historian will 
find it fair in statement, authentic in fact, copious in detail 
and sound in judgment. 

A COMPREHENSIVE HISTORY OF THE CHURCH was 
written by Elder Roberts at the instance of the First Presi- 
dency of the Church, with a commission to make it exhaus- 
tively complete, from the remotest beginnings to the close 
of ffie Centennial Conference of April 6, 1930. The final 
volume ends with an account of the Conference itself, mak- 
ing the history technically inclusive of all that happened in 
Century One of the organized existence of the Church. Thus 
it is a fitting commemoration of one hundred years of strug- 
gle and achievement. 

This monumental work is not to be confused with any former 
history, journal or chronicle. Though its nucleus is the his- 
tory of "Mormonism" published a few years ago in 
AMERICANA, running serially for six years through that 
magazine, yet this History is NEW — new in its wealth of 
material, new in method of treatment and new in its physical 
representation of the book maker's art.

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

It is a source of gratitude and thanksgiving to me that I am per- 
mitted to be with you today at this General Conference. I desire to 
extend to the Saints at home and abroad, and to many friends not of our 
faith, my sincere and heartfelt thanks for the many expressions of 
fellowship, good will and love that have been extended to me since my 
return home ; for the many letters that were written to me by the people 
of the Church, and those not of the Church, and for the many calls from 
friends while I was in the hospital. 

GRATEFUL FOR EVIDENCES OF FRIENDSHIP AND GOOD WILL 

I am grateful beyond expression for all of these evidences of friend- 
ship and good will, and particularly am I grateful to the Saints for their 
prayers and supplications to our Heavenly Father in my behalf during 
my illness. It is a source of a great deal of satisfaction to me to have 
received so many evidences of good will from people during my sickness. 

I believe there is no time in one's life when one feels and appreciates 
more evidences of friendship than when one is seriously sick, and I am 
pleased to say that some of the letters I received were altogether unex- 
pected, and many of the calls I had while in the hospital were also unex- 
pected. At times my room in the hospital almost suggested a funeral, 
because of the great quantity of beautiful flowers there nearly all the time 
I was in the hospital. 

WOULD SOLVE THE WORLD'S PROBLEMS 

I have been thinking very seriously of the wonderful condition that 
the world is in today during the great depression all over the globe, 
and I am convinced in my own mind, without shadow of a doubt, that 
a revelation, covering only one page, given by the Lord, the Creator of 
heaven and earth, to the Prophet Joseph Smith, would solve the problems 
of the world if it were obeyed by the inhabitants of the earth, not only 
solve the problems in our own country but in every country. In thinking 
of what I should say here today in my opening remarks I decided that I 
would read this revelation. 

There are a great many men and women, in fact the great majority 
of all the people in the world believe that Joseph Smith was a false 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT

prophet. When you contemplate the fact that this revelation was given 
a little over one hundred years ago and that it is recognized as scienti- 
fically true today, after investigations have been made by great scientific 
minds, it is remarkable that a young man should be able to give something 
so marvelous as this Word of Wisdom. So as a tribute to the prophet 
who gave it, who was and is and ever will be a prophet of the living God. 
I shall read it. All the disbelief of the world will never change that fact, 
because it is a fact. All the disbelief of the world cannot change the fact 
that this man was chosen of God and became the head of the Church of 
Jesus Christ, the Savior of the world. Disbelief does not change facts. 
The Lord's law of health: 

"A Word of Wisdom, for the benefit of the council of high priests, assembled 
in Kirtland, and the Church, and also the saints in Zion — " 

And I might add, and also for the people of all the world. 

"To be sent greeting; not by commandment or constraint, but by revelation 
and the word of wisdom, showing forth the order and will of God — " 

THE WILL OF GOP 

Many Latter-day Saints remark, "Well, it was not given by com- 
mand, therefore we do not need to obey it." No true Latter-day Saint 
is justified in saying that if the Lord reveals his will to man it is not his 
duty to obey it unless the Lord commands him to do so. The will of God, 
in what? 

" — in the temporal salvation of all saints in the last days — " 

And let me add, for the temporal salvation of all people in all parts 
of the world in the last days. 

"evils and designs" 

"Behold, verily, thus saith the Lord unto you : In consequence of evils and 
designs which do and will exist in the hearts of conspiring men in the last days — " 

And these are the last days, please remember. 

" — I have warned you, and forewarn you, by giving unto you this word 
of wisdom by revelation." 

"Evils and designs," When I see a sign upon which is pictured a 
man presenting a beautiful woman with an engagement ring on the top 
of a ring of cigaret smoke, I realize why the Lord saw fit to talk about 
the men who^ would have evil designs in these last days. I never see one 
of those signs but I think what an absolute crime it is that such a thing- 
can be permitted in a civilized country. 

"That inasmuch as any man drinketh wine or strong drink among you, behold 
it is not good, neither meet in the sight of your Father — " 

The Lord says it is not good, and all the legislatures and all the 
congresses and all the senators and all the officers in the kingdoms of the 
world can say otherwise, but that will not change the word of the Creator 
of heaven and earth. 



8 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

" — only in assembling yourselves together to offer up your sacraments before 

him. 

"And, behold, this should be wine. yea. pure wine of the grape of the vine, of 
your own make. 

"And again, strong drinks are not for the belly, but for the washing of your 
bodies." 

I do not suppose that when we get whisk)-, wine, beer, etc., much 
of it will be used for the washing of people's bodies. 

"And, again, tobacco is not for the body, neither for the belly, and is not good 
for man — " 

Please keep in your minds that this is the Lord speaking. 

" — but is an herb for bruises and all sick cattle, to be used with judgment 
and skill. 

"And again, hot drinks are not for the body or belly. 

FOR THE USE OF M A N 

"And again, verily I say unto you, all wholesome herbs God hath ordained 
for the constitution, nature, and use of man--" 

"Every herb in the season thereof, and every fruit in the season thereof ; 
all these to be used with prudence and thanksgiving. 

"Yea, flesh also of beasts and of the fowls of the air, I, the Lord, have 
ordained for the use of man with thanksgiving ; nevertheless they are to be used 
sparingly ; 

"And it is pleasing unto me that they should not be used, only in times of 
winter, or of cold, or famine. 

"All grain is ordained for the use of man and of beasts, to be the staff of life, 
not only for man but for the beasts of the field, and the fowls of heaven, and all 
wild animals that run or creep on the earth ; 

"And, these hath God made for the use of man only in times of famine and 
excess of hunger. 

"All grain is good for the food of man ; as also the fruit of the vine ; that 
which yieldeth fruit, whether in the ground or above the ground — 

"Nevertheless, wheat for man, and corn for the ox, and oats for the horse, 
and rye for the fowls and for swine, and for all beasts of the field, and barley 
for all useful animals, and for mild drinks, as also other grains. 

A MARVELOUS PROMISE 

"And all Saints who remember to keep and do these sayings, walking in 
obedience to the commandments, shall receive health in their navel and marrow 
to their bones ; 

"And shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden 
treasures." 

What a. marvelous promise ! Is there anything to compare with 
health? Those who have been near death's door many times and who 
have suffered year after year in not being able to accomplish anything in 
the battle of life, know what a valuable thing is good health. 

"And shall run and not be weary, and shall walk and not faint." 

I commend to all Latter-day Saints that they read the marvelous 
testimony delivered from this stand by Brother Creed Haymond who won 
a championship in racing and was the only one on his team who made 
a record, while the others who had used wine failed. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT

"And I, the Lord, give unto them a promise, that the destroying angel shall pass 
by them, as the children of Israel, and not slay them." 

THE WORDS OF THE MARTYRED PATRIARCH 

It has been a great pleasure to me today to read the words of the 
Lord given to Joseph Smith. I am now going to read to you the words 
of the martyred Patriarch : 

"The Lord has told us that 'strong drinks are not for the belly.' Who is it 
that will say that they are, when the Lord says they are not ? That man who says, 
T can drink wine or strong drink, and it will not hurt me,' is not wise. Some 
will say, T know that it did me good, for I was fatigued and feeble on a certain 
occasion, and it revived me, and I was invigorated thereby;. and that is sufficient 
for me.' It may be for you, but it would not be for a wise man; for every spirit of 
this kind will only produce a greater languor when its effects cease to operate 
upon the human body. But you know that you are benefited? Yes, so does the 
man who has mortgaged his property know that he is relieved from his present 
embarrassments; but his temporary relfcf only binds the cords of bondage more 
severely around him. The Lord has not ordained strong drink for the belly, 'but 
for the washing of your bodies.' 

"And, again, 'tobacco is not for the body, neither for the belly, and it is not 
good for man, but is an herb for bruises and all sick cattle, to be used with 
judgment and skill.' Tobacco is a nauseous, stinking, abominable thing, and 
1 am surprised that any human being should think of using it — for an ejder 
especially to eat or smoke it, is a disgrace to him. He is not fit for the office ; he 
ought first to learn to keep the Word of Wisdom, and then to teach others. God 
will not prosper the man who uses it. 

"And again, 'hot drinks are not for the body or belly.' There are many who 
wonder what that can mean, whether it refers to tea or coffee or not I say it 
does refer to tea and coffee. Why is it that we are frequently so dull au'd 
languid? It is because we break the Word of Wisdom. Disease preys upon our 
systems ; * * * and we do not comprehend the things of God. The devil takes ad- 
vantage of us, and we fall into temptation. 

"Let the Saints be wise ; let us lay aside our folly and abide by the command- 
ments of God. So shall we be blessed of the Great Jehovah in time and in eternity. 
We shall be healthy, strong and vigorous ; we shall be enabled to resist disease." 

T1IK WORDS OF RRIGHAM YOUNG 

It is sometimes a good thing to turn back. We will turn back to 
the great pioneer, the man who with others erected this wonderful 
building. At the time of its erection it was the greatest building in all the 
United States, without any center support to the roof. He started to 
build a temple which cost millions of dollars when there were people 
here without means excepting their hands, their courage, their faith and 
their knowledge that God lived. 

President Brigham Young said : 

"So long as you are able to walk and attend to your business, it is folly to 
say that you need ardent spirits to keep you alive. The constitution that a person 
has should be nourished and cherished; and whenever we take anything into the 
system to force and stimulate it beyond its natural capacity, it shortens life. I am 
physician enough to know that. When you are tired and think you need a little 
spirituous liquor, take some bread and butter or bread and milk, and lie down and 
rest. Do not labor so hard as to deem it requisite to get half drunk in order to 
keep up your spirits. If you will follow this counsel, you will be full of life and 
health, and you will increase your intelligence, your joy and comfort. 

"It is a piece of good counsel which the Lord desires his people to observe, 



10 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



that they may live on the earth until the measure of their creation is full. This is 
the object the Lord had in view in giving that Word of Wisdom. To those who 
observe it he will give great wisdom and understanding, increasing their health, 
giving strength and endurance to the faculties of their bodies and minds until they 
shall be full of years upon the earth." 

BENEFITS PROVED 

Let me testify to the benefits of it. President Brigham Young- 
served this people from the day that he was ordained an apostle for more 
than 42 years, until he passed away, with all the cares and hardships that 
rested upon him, and when he passed away he was as old as I am, 76. 
He was in vigorous health of body and mind, but I am sure that what they 
called inflammation of the bowels was appendicitis. Why? Because the 
pain disappeared and we were all rejoicing' that he was on the high road 
to recovery. But what really happened is that the appendix had broken 
and the pain had disappeared, but blood poisoning had set in. 

The successor to President Brigham Young served this people for 
48 long years from the day he was ordained an apostle. The successor 
to John Taylor, Wilford Woodruff, served this people 59 long years 
from the time that he was chosen an apostle. Lorenzo Snow, who suc- 
ceeded Wilford Woodruff, served this people for nearly 53 years, and 
Joseph F. Smith served them for over 52 years. Fleber J. Grant has 
served this people for over 50 years. 

GIVES PERSONAL TESTIMONY 

I leave my testimony with you that I believe as firmly as I believe 
anything in this world that I would not be standing here today talking 
to you if I had not obeyed the Word of Wisdom. When my appendix 
was removed it had broken and blood poisoning, so they said, in the 
third and last stage, had set in. There were nine doctors present and eight 
said I had to die. The chief surgeon in the Catholic hospital turned to 
President Joseph F. Smith, and said : "Mr. Smith, you need not think 
of such a possibility or probability as that this man shall live. Why, 
if he should live it would be a miracle, and this is not the day of miracles." 

That was the message delivered to me by Joseph F. Smith himself 
during his last sickness, and he said : "Our doctor friend who said it 
would be a miracle has passed away. I never saw you looking healthier in 
my life than you do today, Irleber." 

I said to the nurse who told me regarding these nine doctors that 1 
did not want to meet any of them, except the one who said and believed 
that I would pull through. She said: "Me is the house doctor; I will 
call him in." 

I asked him why he disagreed with the others, and he smiled, (he 
was a southerner) and he said: "Mistah Grant, ah just took a chance, 
suh. Ah have felt the pulse, suh, of thousands of patients, being a house 
doctor, in many many hospitals, but ah never felt a pulse just like yours, 
suh. Why, do you know, suh, in all of the tests that I made during an 
hour and three quarters that you were under the knife your heart nevah 
missed one single, solitary beat, and ah made up my mind that that heart 
would pull you through." 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



11 



NOT CONTAMINATED 

What kind of a heart did 1 have ? I had a heart that had pure blood 
in it, that was not contaminated by tea, coffee or liquor. That is why 
the poison in my system was overcome. The doctor who operated upon 
me had made an agreement with me that he was to tell me if I had to die — 
and he did — so that I could write a couple of letters. But I did not write 
them because in the kind providences of the Lord it had been revealed 
in a manifestation that I did not have to die. Men say we cannot receive 
communications from the other world, but my wife whose body lies in 
the grave visited my wife who is alive and told her that my mission was 
not yet ended ; and I had received before that a blessing' by the gift of 
tongues from that identical wife whose body was in the grave. And 
what was in that blessing? That I should live to lift up my voice in 
many lands and in many climes proclaiming the restoration to the earth 
of the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. 

PROPHECY FULFILLED 

I had not lifted up my voice in many lands and many climes at the 
time I was in the hospital, but subsequently I have lifted up my voice 
in England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Germany, France, Belgium, Hol- 
land, Switzerland, Italy, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Canada and Mexico; 
from Portland, Maine, to Portland, Oregon ; from the Canadian border 
down to Florida ; in the Hawaiian Islands and in far-off Japan, proclaim- 
ing the restoration to the. earth of the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, 
the plan of life and salvation ; bearing my witness that I know that God 
lives, that Jesus is the Christ, the Redeemer of mankind, the Savior of 
the world, and that Joseph Smith was a prophet of the true and living 
God. 

FURTHER ADVICE BY PRESIDENT YOUNG 

Continuing the remarks of lirigham Young: 

"Many of our sisters think they cannot live without tea. I will tell you what 
we can, do — I have frequently said it to my brethren and sisters — if they cannot 
live without tea, coffee, brandy, whisky, wine, beer, tobacco, etc., they can die 
without them. This is beyond controversy. If we had the determination that we 
should have, we would live without them or die without them. Let the mother 
impregnate her system with these narcotic influences when she is bringing forth 
a family on the earth, and what does she do? She lays the foundation of weakness, 
palpitation of the heart, nervous affections and many other ills and diseases in 
the system of her offspring that will afflict them from the cradle to the grave. 
Is this righteous or unrighteous, good or evil ? Let my sisters ask and answer the 
question for themselves, and the conclusion which each and every one of them may 
come to is this : 'If I do an injury to my child, I sin.' " 

DOCTORS GIVE EVIDENCE 

I have been trying to find what a brother wrote to me some days 
ago, and so has he, but we have failed — a statement that I wish I could 
read to you here, if it be true — and I have very little doubt but that it is 
true — to the effect that there are some first-class physicians who will 
not answer a call to a wife who is to become a mother if she is an

inveterate cigaret smoker, announcing that the rate of mortality is alto- 
gether too great among such for them to risk their reputation. 

THE WORDS OF PRESIDENT TAYLOR 

President John Taylor : 

"For this purpose he (God) has gathered us here as we are here today — that 
while we are pursuing the natural avocations of life, we might at the same time 
be taught and instructed of God, that we might learn the laws of life — that we 
might be purified from the corruptions and infamies that exist in the world, and 
that our spirits might be purged from everything that tends to deteriorate, injure 
or destroy man ; and that we might be enabled to comprehend those principles 
w hich are calculated to elevate, to exalt and ennoble mankind, and to prepare them 
for the enjoyment of a place among the Gods in the eternal worlds. 

"And in regard to drunkenness we will not be contaminated nor disgraced 
with infamy of such conduct — and as the honesty of a man can only be tested by 
his having temptation within his reach, so no man can be considered as acting 
properly who cannot let liquor alone, when that is within his reach. Virtue does 
not consist simply in being prevented from committing evils, but in having tempta- 
tions presented before us and then governing our passions and appetites. Good 
and evil are placed before us, no matter by whom, it is for us to resist evil and 
cleave to the right. We are told that it is to him that overcometh that I will grant 
to sit down on my throne, as I have overcome and sat down on my Father's throne. 
Neither do we want any excuses for any of these things, for God will condemn 
us if we bear them, and his wrath will be enkindled against us, and we shall find 
it a hard matter to pack such infamies upon our shoulders. Now it is for us to 
choose what course we will pursue. 

"We want men who are Saints from principle, men who love God, who keep 
his commandments, men who are pure and virtuous, men who are seeking to 
glorify God through obedience to his laws, and men who do these things because 
they love to do them. 

"We have entered into covenants with God, and it is only on the condition of 
our keeping our covenants inviolate that we shall be entitled to the exceedingly 
great and precious promises which he has made to us. And he does expect us to 
be true to him." 

PRESIDENT WOODRUFF QUOTED 

President Wilford Woodruff : 

"We are sent into this world to accomplish a great purpose, and to fulfil the 
object of our creation we must observe the commandments of God, and obey the 
ordinances of his house, and walk in them while we live in the flesh, that when 
we have done with this body we can go back into the presence of our Father and 
our God and receive in fulness the blessings and promises made to his children. 

"Those persons who will not walk according to the light they have, must 
sooner or later inherit sore afflictions to themselves ; they do not have joy, and 
happiness, and salvation like that person who obeys the commandments of God 
and constantly does that which is right. The wicked are always in fear. There 
is no inducement for a man or woman to commit sin — it is not a paying business. 
It is better for us to serve the Lord ; for those who serve the Lord morning, noon 
and night are happy, whether they be rich or poor." 

RIDICULE RECALLED 

I call to mind that upon one occasion a man ridiculed the Latter-day- 
Saints, saying, "You people are always happy. If a man hits a Mormon 
and knocks him down, the Mormon thanks the Lord because he needed 
a little chastisement ; and if you hit at a Mormon and miss him, he thanks 
the Lord for not getting hit." 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



13 



"Let us try to live our religion, and try to be friends of God; and let us make 
war against the works of the devil. Let us seek to overcome ourselves, and all 
our evil impressions, and bring our bodies in subjection to the law of Christ, that 
we may walk in the light of the Lord, gain power with him, and assist in sanctifying 
the earth and in building up temples, and in attending to the ordinances of the 
house of God, that we may be saviors of men, both of the living and the dead. These 
are our privileges, and the blessings which the God of heaven has put into our 
hands. 

"Our President (Brigham Young) has frequently told us that we cannot 
separate the temporal from the spiritual, but they must go hand in hand together; 
and so it is, and so we must act in reference to building up the Church and 
Kingdom of God. We should foresee the evil, and then foreseeing it we should 
hide ourselves, and preserve ourselves in purity and holiness. 

"Our temporal and eternal salvation is all connected and linked together. * * * 
The Lord has raised up unto us fathers, leaders, and counselors after his own 
heart: they possess his will, and they are leading the people to exaltation and 
glory." 

FROM PRESIDENT SNOW 

President Lorenzo Snow : 

"The Gospel is proclaimed, a channel is opened through which individuals 
may receive a knowledge of things pertaining to life and salvation, of those things 
that are required at their hands, and of the course they should pursue as the 
servants and handmaidens of God. 

"This Gospel, which God has commanded us to offer to the world, is an order 
or system of things, simple, plain, and may easily be understood. In regard to 
its principles, the nature of its requirements, and the precise kind and character 
of its blessings and promises, no one, however ignorant or unlearned, needs to be 
left in the dark; but may discover its golden truths, and the emblazoned mark 
of divinity in its arrangements. 

"This system of religion, in its nature, in the character of its origin, the 
manner of operations, and in the purposes for which it was designed, coupled with 
the fact that people of honest hearts can and will appreciate divine truth, is such 
that it cannot be destroyed. A man who is honest, full of integrity and love for 
the interest and happiness of mankind, having explored this long untrodden path, 
and made this glorious discovery, will not and cannot keep silent, but despite of 
threats and opposition, however fierce and terrific, will boldly declare the glorious 
fact, spreading and multiplying this divine intelligence, and if so required, seal 
his testimony with his own life's blood. 

"Our mission is to the world and not simply to carry the Gospel to the people, 
but to establish plans and lay schemes for their temporal salvation. Our object 
is the temporal salvation of the people as much as their spiritual salvation. 

"A religious system is of but little account when it possesses no virtue nor 
power to better the condition of people, spiritually, intellectually, morally and 
physically." 

PRESIDENT SMITH QUOTED 

President Joseph F. Smith: 

"I do wish with all my heart — not because I say it, but because it is written 
in the word of the Lord — that you would give heed to the Word of Wisdom. 
It was given unto us 'not by commandment' ; but by the word of President Brigham 
Young, it was made a commandment unto the Saints. It is written here for our 
guidance, for our happiness and advancement in every principle that pertains to the 
kingdom of God, in time and throughout eternity, and 1 pray you to observe it. It 
will do you good ; it will ennoble your souls ; it will free your thoughts and your 
hearts from the spirit of destruction ; it will make you feel like God, who sustains 
even the sparrow, that it does not fall to the ground without his notice; it will 
bring you nearer to the similitude of the Son of God, the Savior of the world, who 



14 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



healed the sick, who made the lame to leap for joy, who restored hearing to the 
deaf and sight to the blind, who distributed peace, joy and comfort to all with whom 
he came in contact, and who cursed and destroyed nothing, save it was the barren 
fig tree, and that was to show forth his power more than anything else. 

" 'And all Saints who remember to keep and do these sayings, walking in 
obedience to the commandments, shall receive health in their navel, and marrow 
to their bones. 

" 'And shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden 
treasures ; 

" 'And shall run and not be weary, and shall walk and not faint ; 

" 'And I, the Lord, give unto them a promise, that the destroying angel shall 
pass by them, as the children of Israel, and not slay them.' 

"Are these glorious promises not sufficient to induce us to observe this Word 
of Wisdom? Is there not something here that is worthy our attention? Are not 
'great treasurers' of knowledge, even 'hidden treasures', something to be desired? 
But when I see men and women addicting themselves to the use of tea and coffee, or 
strong drinks, or tobacco in any form, I say to myself, here are men and women 
who do not appreciate the promises God has made unto them." 

POET QUOTED 

There are three lessons I would write, 
Three words as with a burning pen; 
In tracings of eternal light, 
Upon the hearts of men. 

Have faith, though clouds environ round. 
And gladness hides her face in scorn. 
Put off the darkness from thy brow ; 
No night but hath its morn. 

Have hope, where'er thy bark is driven, 
The calm distorts the tempest's mirth, 
Know this, God rules the Hosts of Heaven, 
The inhabitants of earth. 

Have love, not love alone for one, 
But man as man thy brother call, 
And scatter as the circling sun 
Thy charities on all. 

— Goethe. 

A FAVORITE HYMN 

God moves in a mysterious way, 

His wonders to perform ; 
He plants his footsteps in the sea, 

And rides upon the storm. 

Deep in unfathomable mines, 

Of never failing skill, 
He treasures up His bright designs, 

And works His sovereign will. 

Ye fearful Saints, fresh courage take, 

The clouds ye so much dread 
Are big with mercy, and shall break, 

In blessings on your head. 

Judge not the Lord by feeble sense, 

But trust Him for his grace ; 
Behind a frowning providence, 

He hides a smiling face. ..... 



PRESIDENT HEBER J .'GRANT 



15 



His purposes will ripen fast, 

Unfolding every hour, 
The bud may have a bitter taste, 

But sweet will be the flower. 

Blind unbelief is sure to err, 

And scan his works in vain ; 
God is his own interpreter, 

And He will make it plain. 

The hymn which I have just read was the favorite hymn of the late 
President Wilford Woodruff. We sang- it oftener in our council meet- 
ing's than any other when he was with us. If there ever was a man who 
acknowledged the hand of God in all things more perfectly than did 
Wilford Woodruff I never knew him. 

FROM THOMAS A. EDISON 

One of the greatest benefactors of mankind, in my judgment, by his 
discoveries in electricity was Thomas A. Edison. Way back in 1914 
he wrote a letter to Henry Ford in which he said : 

"The injurious agent in cigarets comes principally from the burning paper 
wrapper. The substance thereby formed is called 'Acrolein.' It has a violent 
action on the nerve centers, producing degeneration of the cells of the brain which 
is quite rapid among the boys. Unlike most narcotics this degeneration is perma- 
nent and uncontrollable. I employ no person who smokes cigarets." 

This was written in 1914, as I have said. I know a great many 
people who formerly did not employ people who smoked cigarets, but 
cigaret smoking has increased so wonderfully, from a few hundred million 
up to hundreds of billions, that they have found it necessary to change 
that rule. 

ENORMOUS CONSUMPTION OF CIGARETS 

During the last four years internal revenue was paid upon a con- 
sumption of 459,419,564,744, or an average of 114,854,891,186 cigarets 
a year. 

What is a billion? During the World war when we were raising 
$6,000,000,000 through the sale of Liberty bonds, the great New York 
Life Insurance Co. sent out a circular announcing that a billion was the 
equivalent of one dollar for every minute from the birth of the Savior 
until now. So each year for four years — and this is not what somebody 
says, but it is from collections of internal revenue — 114,854,891,186 
cigarets were consumed in the United States, which would be equivalent 
to 114 cigarets for every minute since the birth of the Savior. It seems 
incredible. "In consequence of evils and designs which do and will exist 
in the hearts of conspiring men." I have read that the tobacco interests 
hope during this year to add 30,000,000 women to their list of cigaret 
smokers. 

AN IMPRESSIVE LESSON 

1 read from the book, "Personal Efficiency," by James Samuel 
Knox, A. M. : 



16 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

"'You smoke thirty cigarets a day?' 
" 'Yes, on the average.' 

" 'You don't blame them for your run down condition ?' 
" 'Not in the least. I blame my hard work.' 

"The physician shook his head. He smiled in a vexed way. Then he took 
a leech out of a glass jar. 

" 'Let me show you something,' he said. 'Bare your arm.' 

"The cigaret smoker bared his pale arm, and the doctor laid the lean, black 
leech upon it. The leech fell to work busily. Its body began to swell. Then, all 
of a sudden, a shudder convulsed it, and it fell to the floor — dead. 

" 'That's what your blood did to that leech,' said the physician. He took 
up the little corpse between his finger and thumb. 'Look at it,' he said. 'Quite 
dead, you see. You poisoned it' 

" 'I guess it wasn't a healthy leech in the first place,' said the cigaret smoker 
sullenly. 

" 'Wasn't healthy, eh ? Well, we'll try again.' 

"And the physician clapped two leeches on the young man's thin arm. 
" 'If they both die, said the patient, I'll swear off — or, at least, I'll cut down 
my daily allowance from thirty to ten.' " 

What would ten do to him ? A boy who smokes ten cigarets a day 
has inhaled enough poison to kill twenty frogs. 

"Even as he spoke the smaller leech shivered and dropped on his knee dead, 
and a moment later the larger one fell beside it. 

'"This is ghastly,' said the young man; 'I am worse than the pestilence to 
these leeches.' 

" 'It is the empyreumatic oil in your blood,' said the medical man. 'All 
cigaret smokers have it.' 

" 'Doctor,' said the young man, regarding the three dead leeches thoughtfully, 
'I half believe you're right.' " 

EFFECT UPON STUDENTS 

"It is said that within the past fifty years not a student at Harvard University 
who used tobacco has been graduated at the bead of his class, although on the 
average five out of six used tobacco." 

Just exactly five hundred per cent more tobacco smokers in the 
classes, and yet in fifty years not one of them was graduated at the head 
of his class. 

"An investigation of all the students who entered Yale University during 
nine years shows that the cigaret smokers were the inferiors both in weight and 
lung capacity of the non-smokers, although they averaged fifteen months older." 

I would like to read you this whole book but I shall not take the time. 

A VICTIM OF CIGARETS 

"A young man died in a Minnesota state institution not long ago, who five 
years before had been one of the most promising young physicians of the West. 
'Still under thirty years at the time of his commitment to the institution,' says 
a newspaper account of the story. He had already made three discoveries in 
nervous diseases which had made him well known in his profession. But he 
smoked cigarets — smoked incessantly. For a long time the effects of the habit 
were not apparent, in fact, it was not until a patient died on the operating table 
under his hands, and the young doctor went to pieces, that it became known that 
lie was a victim of the paper pipes. But then he had gone too far. He was a 
wreck in mind as well as in body, and ended his days in a maniac's cell." 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT

JUDGE SPEAKS 

"Magistrate Crane of New York City, says : 'Ninety-nine out of a hundred 
boys between the ages of 10 and 17 years who come before me charged with crime 
have their fingers disfigured by yellow cigaret stains. I am not a crank on this 
subject, I do not care to pose as a reformer, but it is my opinion that cigarets will 
do more than liquor to ruin boys. * * * There is something in the poison of the 
cigaret that seems to get into the system of the boy which destroys all moral fiber.' 

"He gives the following probable course of a boy who begins to smoke 
cigarets : First, cigarets. Second, beer and liquors. Third, craps, petty gambling. 
Fourth, horse racing — gambling on a bigger scale. Fifth, larceny. Sixth, state 
prison.' " 

AN INTERESTING EXPERIMENT 

"Dr. J. H. Kellogg says : 'A few months ago I had all the nicotine removed 
from a cigaret, making a solution out of it. I injected half the quantity into a frog 
with the effect that the frog died almost instantly. The rest was administered 
to another frog with like effect. Both frogs were full grown and of average 
size. The conclusion is evident that a single cigaret contains poison enough to 
kill two frogs.' " Then he goes on to tell that twenty cigarets killed forty frogs. 

I have enough material to talk to you for an hour or two but I see 
I have been talking now for fifty-two minutes, and I think that that is 
probably long enough. I shall try to get through in the next seven 
minutes and make it an even hour. 

TESTIMONY OF AN INVENTOR 

"Hudson Maxim has won world renown as the inventor of high explosives 
for use in battle ship guns and torpedoes and for various other purposes. He 
comes out squarely against the cigaret in this fashion: 

" 'The wreath of cigaret smoke which curls about the head of the growing 
lad holds his brain in an iron grip which prevents it from growing and his mind 
from developing just as surely as the iron shoe does the foot of the Chinese girl. 

" 'In the terrible struggle for survival against the deadly cigaret smoke, 
development and growth are sacrificed by nature, which in the fight for very life 
itself must yield up every vital luxury such as healthy body growth and growth 
of brain and mind. 

" 'If all boys could be made to know that with every breath of cigaret smoke 
they inhale imbecility and exhale manhood, that they are tapping their arteries as 
surely and letting their life's blood out as truly as though their veins and arteries 
were severed, and that the cigaret is a maker of invalids, criminals and fools — 
not men — it ought to deter them some. The yellow finger stain is an emblem 
of deeper degradation and enslavement than the ball and chain'." 

BURRANK'S DECLARATION 

"Several of my young acquaintances are in their graves who gave promise 
of making happy and useful citizens,'' declares Luther Burbank, the wizard of 
the plant and vegetable kingdom, whose experiments have caused the civilized 
world to wonder" — and whose experiments have benefited the civilized world 
millions upon millions of dollars every year — '"and there is no question what- 
ever that cigarets alone were the cause of their destruction. No boy living 
would commence the use of cigarets if he knew what a useless, soulless, worthless 
thing they would make of him." 

A NEW ARITHMETIC 

" 'I am not much of a mathematician,' said the cigaret, 'but I can add nervous 
troubles to a boy, I can subtract from his physical energy, I can multiply his 



18 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



aches and pains, 1 can divide his mental powers, I can take interest from his 
work and discount his chances for success'." 

As I was not here six months ago I thought I was entitled to occupy 
an hour, and that is why I have taken so much time. 
The Lord bless you, Amen. 

The congregation arose and sang the hymn, "Now let us rejoice in 
the day of salvation." 

ELDER REED SMOOT 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

I am thankful for the privilege of attending this General Conference 
of the Church of Jesus Christ, and I know it will result in blessings to 
the people and be profitable to all those present and the thousands that are 
ma-king use of the radio to hear all that may be said during the three 
days of this Annual Conference. 

At this conference, like all that have been held in the past, words of 
counsel, instructions, and admonitions will be given, and never before 
in the history of the Church were they so sorely needed. The opening 
remarks of President Grant were timely and given under the inspiration 
of our Heavenly Father, and if followed will result in God's blessings to 
all. Let our constant prayer be for the glory and welfare of the Church 
and for the preservation of the United States. 

THE WORLD'S MOST URGENT NEED 

The distracted world of today needs above all things, true religion 
as taught by Jesus Christ- while in the flesh and restored in this the last 
dispensation through Joseph Smith, the prophet. Our Church has a 
regard for the welfare of God's children and the ultimate salvation of 
them all. Our religion does not make its adherents selfish, but on the 
contrary creates in their hearts a feeling of charity and desire to bless. 
We do not wish the downfall of a son or daughter of God, but rather 
we desire their happiness, comfort and joy. This was our Heavenly 
Father's desire and plan in the beginning. His plan of salvation which 
was prepared before the creation of the world was designed for the 
improvement, the benefit and the ultimate salvation of all his sons and 
daughters. Whenever we have a desire to assist our fellowman we take 
the position approved by our Heavenly Father, but when we feel other- 
wise, we are on slippery ground. The Master came into the world not 
to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be saved. 
That was the purpose of the coming of our Savior, Jesus Christ, in the 
flesh, and of the atonement that he wrought out for mankind by his 
death on the cross. 

How often I have been asked, and in all sincerity I might add, if the 
Mormon Church believes in Jesus Christ ? My answer has always been, 
"Perhaps to a greater degree than any other Church organization in the 
world." We believe Jesus Christ to be the actual Son of God — the 
second in the Godhead, foreordained to his birth, his mission and cruci- 



ELDER REED SMOOT 



19 



fixion. The spirit of Christ is the spirit of salvation, of blessing to do 
good, to prepare us all for the presence of our eternal Father and to 
enjoy the glory of his kingdom. 

SALVATION FOR ALL 

I have been asked hundreds, if not thousands of times, what differ- 
ence there is between the belief of the Latter-day Saints and that of most 
of the Christian denominations — as to the ultimate salvation of the 
peoples of this world. I have answered briefly that the Latter-day Saints 
teach that salvation is for all people — of all ages, of all races, of all colors, 
— who can be saved. The revelation to Joseph Smith is that salvation is 
to come to all, and that none will be lost who can possibly be redeemed — 
that the plan of salvation is as broad as the fall of man. 

Our first parents broke a divine law and through their disobedience 
death came into the world — while on the other hand, through the atone- 
ment and obedience of Christ, life and salvation will ultimately come 
to all the family of Adam. "As in Adam all die, so in Christ shall all be 
made alive." 

A DIVINE MESSAGE 

We all testify that in the nineteenth century our Heavenly Father 
has been pleased to open the heavens once more and send his Son, Jesus 
Christ, our Redeemer, with a divine message, conforming in every 
respect to the teachings of this same Christ while in mortality. We know 
that angels have been sent from the Father declaring truths that would 
insure salvation for all who receive and obey them. I recognize that the 
ordinary person hesitates a long time before he considers it worth while 
to consider such a declaration, and he can never become convinced until 
through faith and prayer a testimony from an unerring source is received 
by him. We declare that angels have come down from heaven, bringing 
light and truth for the salvation of all the human family, and a message 
to be proclaimed to every nation, kindred, tongue and people. How well 
this obligation on our part has been carried forward God knows best. 

THE PERSONALITY OF GOD 

The greatest religious teacher among men was Jesus, the Nazarene. 
In his personality God was manifest in the flesh. He revealed Deity to 
humanity. He showed that God was in reality the Father of the spirits 
of men. He proclaimed that he was in the beginning with God — that 
he came forth from God, land would return to God and that all mankind 
were his brethren, made in the image of God, and part of his eternal 
family. This presents God as actually and literally "Our Father which 
art in heaven." It takes away the mystery with which false faiths have 
enveloped the Supreme Being — beclouding the minds of men and making 
God utterly incomprehensible. 

Jesus taught that his Father and our Father is a personal being — 
man being in his likeness - — Jesus being himself in his express 
image. He taught also that he was sent into the world to save 
mankind and bring them back to the Father's presence; that no man 



20 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



could come unto God but by him. The true Christian religion, therefore, 
combines faith in Jesus Christ, the Son, with faith in God the eternal 
Father. 

NOT ONE IN PERSON 

Christ further taught the existence of a divine Spirit proceeding 
from God, to enlighten the souls of men ; that is, the Holy Ghost, by 
which the mind and will of God may be made known to man, and by 
which holy men chosen of God, have been inspired in different ages to 
declare his word. 

That the unity of the Godhead is not oneness in person is made 
very clear in the account of the baptism of Jesus Christ. The Son on 
that occasion, coming up out of the waters of Jordan, the Holy Spirit 
descending upon him in the form of a dove, and the voice of the Father 
from heaven proclaiming "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well 
pleased." Jesus said, "I came forth from the Father, and am come unto 
the world : again, I leave the world, and go to the Father." He also 
prayed to the Father and in the prayer recorded by John, explained in 
unmistakable language what he meant when he declared, "I and my 
Father are one." 

Anything that God reveals must be true, because he is truth, and 
everything that comes by the way of Jesus Christ, his beloved Son, must 
be true, for he is the way, the truth and the life. No error will be intro- 
duced into the world under the direction of the Father, or the Son. 

DESTRUCTIVE AGENCIES 

We are living in trying times — international struggles are imminent 
■ — -"Nation rising against Nation" for supremacy and existence. Civilized 
governments are threatened by internal and destructive agencies in the 
form of Communism. This secret organization assumes different names 
and forms. It is Communism in France, Socialism in Germany, Inter- 
nationalism in Spain and Italy, Nihilism in Russia, and similar sentiments 
and principles are cloaked under a variety of titles in America and 
Great Britain. All these organizations are opposed in spirit to all the 
restraints of law and order. Now let me call your attention to the fact 
that in February, 1831, Joseph Smith received a revelation on this very 
subject, which no doubt many of you are familiar with. Reference is 
also made along the same lines in the Book of Mormon. Secularism and 
infidelity are sweeping over the world ; millions are indulging in every 
kind of iniquity. Crime is increasing with such rapidity that the large 
cities of the world find it next to impossible to cope with it. 

I know that it is easier to point out evils than the particular way of 
destroying them. I know it will take the united effort of honest, patriotic, 
liberty loving citizens, to meet the situation. The churches must play 
an important part. 

The Church of Jesus Christ has never ceased its opposition to or- 
ganizations such as I have mentioned and never will. 

I bear witness that our Heavenly Father has again established his 
Church on earth and revealed the everlasting Gospel for the salvation jpf 
all who believe and obey. 



ELDER REED SMOOT 



21 



My brethren and sisters, I am sure that during this conference the 
Spirit of the living God will be made manifest to those who speak unto us. 

NOT NECESSARY TO VIOLATE LAWS OF GOD 

I want particularly to call your attention to the wonderful remarks 
that have been made by President Grant this morning. Oh, if we only 
would put them into practice — I mean every member of the Church — 
what a wonderful influence we would have as a people in the different 
parts of this country and in the world! Our very lives and acts would 
testify of the Gospel of Jesus Christ and its results in the lives of its 
membership. I never lost anything in this world by obeying the laws 
of God. I never lost anything in my capacity as a Senator of the United 
States by not indulging in the habits that are prohibited by my Church. 
For years perhaps those among whom I associated thought it was strange. 
I have never taken z. drink of liquor in my life. I have never smoked 
in my life. I have never found it necessary that I should do so at any 
time in order to win respect and the favors of men who do us'e those 
things. On the contrary, my brethren and sisters, I want to testify to 
you that there has been nothing for which I have been honored and 
respected more than my devotion to the beliefs that I have. I may 
add, religious beliefs and moral beliefs, which latter are a very important 
part of our teachings as a Church. 

I do not think there is any honorable calling to which a man may 
be called, either privately or publicly, in which, in order to be successful, 
he must violate the laws of God. There is no necessity for it, and I want 
to say to you that whenever people who know that the laws of the Church 
prohibit certain actions, see a member of the Church violate those actions, 
instead of winning the respect of men by such violation he loses it. 

IN ACCORDANCE WITH ONE'S PROFESSED FAITH 

Oh, yes, we have lots of men and some women in the Church who 
smoke. I wish that every one of them could have heard the remarks 
of the President this morning. We as members of the Church can 
testify to the truth of his remarks. But the day is coming when the 
scientists, when the men standing at the head of great business concerns, 
will always ask, when a man is needed to fill an important position, how 
he lives, what are his daily habits, what does he believe in, and does he 
live in accordance with his professed faith. When that time comes, and 
it is beginning now, I will be glad if the greater percentage of the people 
of our Church live the commandments, if they are clean and virtuous 
in their lives. This is almost a thing of the past in some sections of 
the world. 

But as the last days approach, I say to you, my brethren and sisters, 
it is going to come, and God will magnify a people who not only profess 
these wonderful truths but live them. God grant that we may have power 
to do so, that the Church as a church will never be called upon to 
apologize for men or women known as the leaders and members of the 
Church. Peace be with us. May God's blessings attend us during the 
remainder of this conference, I ask in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.

FIRST DAY 
AFTERNOON MEETING 

The second session of the Conference commenced at 2 o'clock, when 
President Heber J. Grant announced that the congregation would sing 
the hymn, "Guide us, O thou great Jehovah." 

After singing, prayer was offered by Elder Joseph S. Peery. 

Following the opening prayer a sacred solo, "My Task," was sung 
by Elder Golden Hansen. 

ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

I was very greatly pleased this morning in listening to the remarks 
by our President, and to have our attention called to matters which I 
consider to be of great importance. 

I think I have stated before from this stand that we are living in 
perilous times, times when the members of the Church should be thought- 
ful, diligent, persevering, and determined to keep the commandments of 
the Lord as they have been made known unto us by revelation. 

A WONDERFUL ADVANTAGE 

We have a wonderful advantage over the world in this, that we 
have the right and privilege of receiving instruction through inspiration 
and revelation. For one hundred years the Lord has spoken unto this 
people, giving us line upon line, precept upon precept, and one example 
following another, counsel, advice and knowledge in abundance con- 
cerning the things pertaining to our salvation and the kingdom of God. 

We have learned through revelation and through the guidance that 
has come from holy men, both ancient prophets and those of our own 
day, it is our duty to live in accordance with law which governs us in this 
life, and which pertains to this life, just as well as to be governed by 
laws which pertain to the spiritual life, or the life which is to come. 
Temporal salvation is just as important in its sphere as spiritual salvation 
is in its sphere. In fact, temporal salvation and spiritual salvation are 
so closely united that they cannot be separated. There is no dividing 
line. 

THE PURPOSE OF MORTAL LIFE 

We have been placed here in this world for the purpose of gaining 
experience, also for the purpose of proving ourselves, whether or not 
we will be worthy, before the Lord, of a place in his kingdom. It has 
been made known unto us that even before the foundation of the world 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 



23 



a council was held, and there the plan of salvation was made known 
unto the spirits of men; and the Son of God, even Jesus Christ, who 
gave instructions upon that occasion — and perhaps there were more 
occasions than one — stated that he and others would go down and form 
a world upon which these spirits should dwell, the object being to prove 
them herewith, to find out whether they would be obedient in all things. 
There the plan of salvation was discussed, and the promise was made 
that those who were obedient in that first estate should have a place in 
this second estate in which we now find ourselves. And they who prove 
themselves true and faithful to the commandments, the guidance and 
the instruction which have come from the Lord j n this present estate, 
should have glory added upon their heads forever. 

THE LORD'S PLAN 

Now, we know that it is the plan and purpose of the Lord to bring 
to pass the immortality and the eternal life of all men. No matter whether 
they believe in him or not, no matter whether they are rebellious, or 
whether they receive the truth and walk in the light, all who have the 
privilege of this mortal life are to be redeemed, so we are informed, from 
death. All mortal souls are to receive the resurrection. All are re- 
deemed from Adam's transgression, as we are pleased to call it, through 
the mercy of Christ; because we are not responsible for that transgres- 
sion; we do not have to pay the price. Christ came and paid that 
price and redeemed us from death, from what is generally spoken of 
as original sin; but on conditions of our repentance and obedience to 
Gospel law, for salvation in the kingdom of God comes on no other 
terms. If we are obedient, if we will keep the commandments that are 
given, walk in the light of truth, known as the principles of the Gospel, 
then we are to have added upon our heads exaltation and glory forever. 

OBEDIENCE TO TEMPORAL AND PHYSICAL LAWS REQUIRED 

But in this life we are subject to the vicissitudes of mortal life ; we 
are subject to all the laws which govern in this world. We speak of many 
of these laws as temporal laws, or physical laws. Nevertheless, it is 
just as necessary that we be obedient to the temporal and physical laws, 
or rather, the laws which govern in this mortal life, as it is for us to be 
obedient to things which we are pleased to call spiritual, and which we 
look upon as pertaining to that life which is to come after the resurrec- 
tion from the dead. 

One of the great objects of our existence here, indeed the greatest, 
is to receive these bodies or tabernacles of flesh, tabernacles for our 
individual spirits. Then, of course, through obedience our physical 
tabernacles and our spirits, unitedly known as the soul, receive a fulness 
of joy; and it is destined that the obedient, the faithful, shall go back 
into the presence of God, there to become sons and daughters, receiving a 
fulness of the blessings of the kingdom of God. 

ETERNAL BLESSINGS THROUGH CLEAN LIVING 

If in this life we abuse these tabernacles of flesh, if we treat them 



24 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



with contempt, if we permit them to be filled with all manner of corrup- 
tion, then we are destroying that physical tabernacle which pertains to 
the spirit and which, with the spirit united, constitutes the soul, so that 
we as individuals cannot receive that fulness of joy which is promised 
to the sanctified. 

I think enough of my body to want to keep it clean. I have been 
so trained. My comprehension of this Gospel, my study, all that pertains 
to the Gospel as I have learned it, teaches me that it is my duty to keep 
this body clean and unspotted from the contamination of this world. 
Now, we are in the presence of temptation, we are in the presence of 
grievous sin. It was understood in the beginning, for we were informed 
before we came here, that we would be confronted with all these earthly 
conditions, and be subject to temptation ; but it does not necessarily follow 
that because temptation is before us, we have to yield to it. It is the 
overcoming of the world, the overcoming of sin, that makes us strong, 
and prepares us for things yet to come. The man who yields to every 
appetite and every desire of the flesh cannot receive exaltation, because 
he does not prepare himself for and make himself worthy of it. 

SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD 

This life is a school. It is a most wonderful school, because here 
we receive that training that will prepare us and qualify us, through 
obedience to the principles of the Gospel, to become sons and daughters 
of God, to dwell in his presence, to receive all that the Father has. What 
a glorious thought this is ! Oh, how I rejoice to know that the Lord 
has made this known unto us, that it is within our power to become like 
him ! 

I think so frequently of the words of John, a.s they are recorded 
in the third chapter of the first epistle that was written by him, and which 
I desire to read to you : 

"Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we 
should be called the sons of God : therefore the world knoweth us not, because 
it knew him not. 

"Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we 
shall be : but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him ; for we 
shall see him as he is." 

Now, John understood clearly, as did Peter and Paul and the 
others of the apostles, that through obedience to the Gospel, including 
all the ordinances and the covenants that they entered into, they were 
even then the sons of God, because of those covenants and obligations 
they had taken upon themselves. So John says, speaking unto the 
Saints — he is not speaking to the world : 

"■Now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we 
shall be: but we know that, when he [Christ] shall appear, we shall be 
like him." 

That is we shall see that we are like him, also sons of God as he is 
a Son of God, with this difference, of course, that Jesus Christ is the 
Only Begotten, one of the Godhead whom we worship. We are his 



ELDER JOSEPH FIELDING SMITH 25 



brethren, joint heirs, as Paul has said, with him in that kingdom. That 
is our privilege. 

THE LORD'S DESIRE CONCERNING US 

John continues: 

"And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he 
[Christ} is pure." 

We should keep ourselves clean and pure from sin, from anything 
that tends to destroy the functions of these bodies, these tabernacles. 
The Lord intends that we should keep them holy, sanctified, cleansed 
from all iniquity. We cannot do that if we partake of the evils that we 
find in the world. No man who uses tobacco can keep his body clean. 
No man can keep his body clean when he puts into it alcoholic beverages. 
That cannot be done. The Lord has pointed out, in that wonderful reve- 
lation to which reference has been made, what we shall eat and what we 
shall drink, as well as the things that we should not eat and drink. He 
has warned us and told us what things are not good. We have our 
agency. Every man has the power within him to act for himself. 
No man is compelled to do the will of God and enter into the kingdom. 
He may reject that; but every man is going to answer for his works. 
He is going to receive a reward according to that which he does in the 
flesh. 

I say again, my training makes me feel to honor this tabernacle 
that has been given unto me. When I say Me* what do I mean ? I don't 
know what life is. I could not give you a proper definition of it. But 
I know that there is an individuality which I call myself. You each 
have your individuality. That individuality is composed of spirit and 
body. The body is the tabernacle of the spirit. Together they shall 
rise, after the resurrection, to receive that fulness of joy in the kingdom 
of God, provided they have kept this estate and been true and faithful 
to all the commandments of God. 

DUTY TO SAFEGUARD THE YOUTH 

I am a firm, believer in this, and that we should throw" out every 
safeguard to hedge our youth about and protect them from the evils of 
the world. I do not think it is necessary for them to come in contact 
with sin. There is temptation enough, there is sin enough, that they 
will find; and it is my duty, as far as I am able. to do* it, to protect my 
children and your children. I want them protected. For that reason 
I am absolutely opposed with all my soul to the repeal of the Eighteenth 
Amendment. I know what it means. I know what the conditions were 
before we had prohibition. I think I know what the conditions will 
be after it is repealed, if that shall come. 

Latter-day Saints, from one end of the earth to the other, especially 
the good people living in these states of this Rocky Mountain region, 
we should stand for that which is right, for the truth, for the Gospel 
of Jesus Christ, f or the protection which we are entitled to receive ; and 
therefore we should stand unitedly against these evils that are creeping 
in among us from the world. The world is full of evil. 



26 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



STAND IN HOLY PLACES 

So I pray. May the Spirit of the Lord guide us, protect us, keep 
us free from these contaminating influences and evils after which the 
world seeks. We should not seek for them. It is our duty to stand in 
holy places, as the Lord has commanded us, and be not moved. I want 
to say to you that day is not far distant, as I have read here, when the 
Son of Man shall come in a cloud of glory, to reward men according 
to their works. He shall come in a day of wickedness, of corruption, 
to take vengeance upon the ungodly, and to reward the righteous. 
Therefore, it behooves us, as I say, to stand in holy places and be not 
moved. May we do it, I pray, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, 
Amen. 

ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 

President of the Southern States Mission 

I humbly pray that the Lord will condescend to bless me in the few 
remarks that I shall make. 

With all of my brethren and sisters, I rejoice in the presence and 
instructions of President Heber J. Grant. We thank the Father for 
President Grant's recovery from his illness. With all my heart and soul 
I sustain all of the General Authorities of the Church, and I feel that 
the will of God has been manifested, to the spiritual benefit of the people, 
in the selection of these two splendid brethren, J. Reuben Clark and 
Samuel O. Bennion, for the offices to which they have been appointed 
and sustained. 

In the old Jewish Talmud there is a story of Elijah and a certain 
rabbi who went upon a journey and stopped at the house of a poor man 
whose only possessions were a wife and a cow. The good people made 
the strangers as comfortable as possible. However, the next morning 
the cow died. * * * The rabbi was puzzled and asked Elijah to explain. 
Elijah said : "In regard to the poor man who received us so hospitably, 
it was decreed that his wife was to die that night, but, in reward for his 
kindness God took the cow instead of the wife. * * * Say not, therefore, 
to the Lord, what doest thou, but say in thine heart. Must not the Lord 
of all the earth do right?" 

I believe, brethren and sisters, that this depression, in the presence 
of which men stand confused and dazed, may be a blessing in disguise. 
I believe that in this national and world-wide disaster there is good 
that is striving for deliverance and triumph. It may be that we shall learn 
the lessons of adversity and emerge from this cloud better men and wom- 
en. The horrors of another world war have probably been averted 
by this depression. God doeth all things for the best. 

There never was a time in the history of the Church when the Lat- 
ter-day Saints were required to be more valiant in preaching and living 
the Gospel than they are today. 

An atheist once said that he and his associates hoped to overthrow 
Christianity by pulling down the family altars of prayer. If our national 
Congress and state legislatures were to discontinue the age-honored cus- 



ELDER CHARLES A. CALLIS 



27 



torn of invoking the blessings of God upon their deliberations there are 
many prayerless parents in the country who would rebuke these legis- 
lative bodies, for even people who cling to a form of religion appreciate 
the value of prayer. In a home without prayer the seeds of infidelity 
are being sown. But in a home where there is prayer, where the family 
reverently gathers around the altar of prayer, faith increases, love for 
God and man mounts high in the human heart. We are learning that 
■ in this great catastrophe, without God we are nothing. 

I believe in the Book of Mormon. It is the word of God. We are 
warned in this sacred record that the promise of a high destiny for any 
nation will not save it if a nation forgets God. Proud confidence in 
their destiny did not save nations in the past from self-destruction. We 
may boast in our pride and glory of the magnificent mission of our own 
republic, but unless the love of Jesus Christ is invoked in all of our 
dealings, unless the spirit of Christ reigns uppermost in our hearts and 
permeates our actions, these promises for a glorious destiny, so far as 
we are concerned, will fail, as they have failed with nations in the past. 

Nations cannot survive where the family altar of prayer is thrown 
down. No people can prosper long materially who do not acknowledge 
and believe that Jesus Christ is the God of the whole earth. 

Moroni, in the early part of the fifth century, gave this solemn 
warning to the people living in these days : 

"And this cometh unto you, O ye Gentiles, that ye may know the decrees of 
God — that ye may repent, and not continue in your iniquities until the fulness 
come, that ye may not bring down the fulness of the wrath of God upon yiou as 
the inhabitants of the land have hitherto done." (Ether 2:11.) 

In God alone is our hope. "He cannot look upon sin with the least 
degree of allowance." 

Brethren and sisters, I testify unto you that from the bottom of my 
heart I know the Gospel is true ; I know that Jesus is my Savior, the 
Christ, the Son of the living God. I also know, by the same power — 
the gift of the Holy Ghost — that Joseph Smith was a choice prophet, a 
seer and a revelator, a man whom God raised up to accomplish a mighty 
work. I have seen the manifestation of God's power upon President 
Grant. We have seen this power manifested in the ministry of all the 
prophets of God in this, the dispensation of the fulness of times. 

God bless us with purity of heart and singleness of purpose,, and 
fortify us by the faith which he has delivered to us through his prophets, 
I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 

First Counselor in the Presiding Bishopric 

I am happy, my brethren and sisters, to be with you this 
afternoon and in conference this morning. It was my good fortune 
and privilege, years ago, to be a student in a class under our new 
president. I have known him from that time to the present day, 
and as one of the Presidency of the Church I sustain him and them 
with all my heart. 



28 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Referring to the remarks of President Grant this morning — 
and I have heard him speak in a similar manner many times, and 
have gone from meetings and have heard my brethren make light 
of his advice and his counsel/ — I want to say now, in all sincerity, 
that I believe the Word of Wisdom was revealed to Joseph Smith, 
I know God will not be mocked, and if we disregard this advice 
and make light of it, we shall see the day when we shall pay the 
price which will fall upon us as a severe rebuke that cannot be 
disregarded. 

For twenty-five years I have been engaged in hospital work, 
nearly seven years as superintendent of a hospital. During that 
time I have had what I think to be an excellent opportunity to put 
the Word of Wisdom to the test, comparing its teachings with the 
physical and spiritual conditions of those who are compelled to 
go into these institutions for treatment. It is a well known fact 
that poisoned bodies, made so through disobedience to the Word 
of Wisdom, are weakened and have less resistance against disease. 
Scientific discoveries being constantly made are added testimonies 
to the truthfulness of the Word of Wisdom. One instruction given 
by the government to its soldiers is: "Men should not smoke while 
on the march. Smokers are more apt to be sick and fall out than 
non-smokers." It is hard to get individuals to observe this advice. 
It has been given to the army because scientific discoveries and 
experience make such advice seem important. 

I desire to call attention to another thought in relation to the 
Word of Wisdom. We seem timid about referring to the statement 
of the Lord that "they shall receive health in their navel," and some- 
times we are shocked or seem to think it to be immodest. I am 
at a loss to know why, for the navel is a scar on the body having 
served its purpose when we came into the world and after birth 
ceases to function. The Savior's sermons were largely given as 
parables. The revelations given to Joseph Smith were brief and 
to the point. The definition of navel as given in the dictionary is 
"the central point or part of anything; the middle." The Lord 
could have mentioned the vital organs of the body, which would 
require the enumeration of each. How much simpler to use the 
expression given. 

How fully do we grasp the meaning of the promise that we 
shall have marrow to the bones? We learn that marrow to the 
bone is as a hub to a wheel where the spokes center ; it is the 
inner meaning and'p ur P ose ; the inner substance; the essence; the 
essential strength. "The so-called spinal marrow or spinal cord is 
the central axis of the nervous system." The fact that Joseph 
Smith in his 27th year, with no college education, could make such 
statements as found in this revelation, which 100 years later are 
supported by the findings of scientists, at least suggests that we 
must look for some power other than that discovered through his 
own knowledge. He took no credit to himself and acknowledged 
that he was only a humble instrument used by our Heavenly Father 



ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 



29 



to give this warning to his children, to help them preserve their 
inheritance, the greatest possession of which is these temples, the 
dwelling place of our spirit, which body and spirit together consti- 
tute the soul of man. Have we the right to accuse anyone of being- 
narrow minded or selfish when he calls our attention to these things. 
Is it not really an evidence of his love for us and concern for our 
welfare ? 

Recently a young man came into the Presiding Bishop's Office 
to see me. He said: "Brother Smith, I had a dream. In the 
dream I was told to come to you. I have suffered from stomach 
trouble. I was given to understand that you could help me, if I 
should come to you." 

I told him to keep the Word of Wisdom, to stop using coffee, 

etc. 

He looked somewhat startled. I didn't know that he was a user 
of coffee, but I was impressed to make the statement. 

"Brother Smith," he answered, "I think I can do that." 

Then I talked to him about the Word of Wisdom and asked 
him to make a test for a week or two and come back. 

Sometimes, it seems to me, we plead with the Lord for blessings 
when at the time we are doing things which make it difficult for 
him to give us the blessings for which we plead. To me it is a 
mockery. Under such conditions we cannot approach him in faith 
for we are not worthy to enjoy that privilege. 

I wonder if, in these days of depression, we take time to review 
the history from the beginning of this Church and ponder over the 
problems of its founders. Our problems are insignificant when 
compared to theirs. Looking back as we may do today we can 
see the hand of the Lord in the movements westward. Persecu- 
tions and hardships united them and developed in them faith in 
God, tolerance and love for their fellows. Little did they dream in 
the beginning that they were destined to move on and on until 
they should establish headquarters in the "top of the mountains." 
Their enemies forced them to do so and the hardships which fol- 
lowed developed God-fearing men and women of sterling worth. 
The Spirit of the Lord was upon them and traveled before them. 
They were not afraid and did not permit themselves to become 
discouraged. Their battle cry was : 

Come, come ye Saints, no toil nor labor fear, 

But with joy wend your way; 

Tho' hard to you this journey may appear, 

Grace shall be as your day. * * * 

Why should we think to earn a great reward, 

If we now shun the fight? 

Gird up your loins, fresh courage take, 

Our God will never us forsake. 

They were our fathers and our mothers. Do we forget that 
they were the chosen of the Lord to prepare the way for those 
who should follow? It was their mission to fulfil the prophecy 
of Isaiah 2 :2-3 : 



30 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



"And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord's 
house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above 
the hills ; and all nations shall flow unto it. 

"And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain 
of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, 
and we will walk in his paths : for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word 
of the Lord from Jerusalem." 

The Prophet Ezekiel gave us a picture which should encourage 

us : 

"Thus saith the Lord God ; I will also take of the highest branch of the 
high cedar, and will set it ; I will crop off from the top of his young twigs a tender 
one, and will plant it upon an high mountain and eminent : 

"In the mountain of the height of Israel will 1 plant it : and it shall bring 
forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a goodly cedar : and under it shall dwell 
all fowl of every wing; in the shadow of the branches thereof shall they dwell. 

"And all the trees of the field shall know that I the Lord have brought down 
the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up the green tree, and have 
made the dry tree to flourish : I fhe Lord have spoken and have done it." (Ezekiel 
17:22-24.) 

And I repeat, "the Lord has spoken and has done it." 

We are of that stock. Have we forgotten their suffering? 
Are we willing to take upon us the burden? Do we quit when 
trials come upon us? Or are we willing, as they were willing, to 
face the wilderness, full of faith, determined that we shall do our 
part, in order that we may receive and enjoy the blessings of the 
Lord? That is our mission, but how well are we taking our part? 

During the last four years we have increased the activity of 
our young men to a point where the low point of activity at the 
close of 1932 is almost on a level with the high point four years ago. 
And yet in many places we are lagging. There is much we can 
do which is left undone. While we are looking after our young 
men who hold the Aaronic priesthood, what of their brothers and 
their fathers who have gone beyond the age in which the}' are 
expected to serve in the Aaronic priesthood? It seems that we are 
leaving them too much alone and are doing very little for them. 

Now is the time, it seems to me, in which men who hold the 
priesthood should have faith. They should feel that service in this 
church is required of all ; if we hope to develop spiritually, now 
is the time in which we should take advantage of the leisure time 
we have, through unemployment or other causes, and give not 
only our substance but our faith and our love to those who are 
careless and indifferent, those who are drifting away and to whom 
the Gospel must be preached again. 

Now, I realize that I am not expected to speak long. Let me 
picture a little incident to you, if I can< — one of the many I have 
seen. Let me take you back some years. We enter a little home, 
two rooms. We find three little girls, ragged and dirty, and with 
bare feet; a mother poorly clothed ; no comforts in the home; 
and in the corner the husband and father in a drunken stupor, an 
Elder in the Church of Jesus Christ, a man 'who had been ordained 



ELDER DAVID A. SMITH 



31 



to the priesthood and sealed in the house of the Lord to his wife 
for time and all eternity. Bad company caused him to forget his 
covenants. Liquor took away from him his reason, from his chil- 
dren their food and clothing, and from his wife and children the 
comforts of home. Then visit with me in that home, not three 
months later but next week, and the next week, and every week 
for nearly a year; and little by little partake of his joy as he finds 
someone to help him overcome his weakness ; then, finally, as he is 
persuaded to kneel in prayer, feels the spirit which comes, for 
God is with vis when we sincerely pray. We feel the added joy 
when finally we hear him admit that he hasn't the power over that 
damnable influence which had caused his disgrace and almost 
ruined his home. He pleads for someone to call on his employer 
and get his check on pay-day, pay his bills, make his purchases. 
And later we see him enter the quorum meeting, with the under- 
standing that he will not be called upon to take part until he sig- 
nifies willingness to do sq. After a while we hear him say : "I 
believe I can now take part," and we note the concern that comes 
when in his first attempt he apparently makes a miserable failure. 
But prayer, love and kindness have touched his soul, the Spirit of 
God is upon him, for realizing he has made a failure he turns to say : 
''I am not satisfied. I want to try again." We realize that he has 
won. He continues to grow in faith and becomes active, and master 
of himself again. 

I had not seen this man for nearly thirty years when, one 
evening while attending a meeting in the ward in which he lived 
recently, at the close of the service an elderly gentleman with white 
hair, round face, bright, flashing eyes, reached out his hand and 
I took hold of it, hardly recognizing him. He placed his free arm 
around 'me and said: "Brother Smith, I love you." 

It seems to me that there are but few things in life that could 
bring greater joy than to have such an experience. It helps us 
to understand this statement revealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith : 

"Remember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God ; 

"For, behold, the Lord your Redeemer suffered death in the flesh ; wherefore 
he suffered the pain of all men, that all men might repent and come unto him. 

"And he hath risen again from the dead, that he might bring all men unto 
him, on conditions of repentance. 

"And how great is his joy in the soul that repenteth ! 

"Wherefore, you are called to cry repentance unto this people. 

"And if it so be that you should labor all your days in crying repentance 
unto this people, and bring, save it be one soul unto me, how great shall be your 
joy with him in the kingdom of my Father! 

"And now, if your joy will be great with one soul that you have brought 
unto me into the kingdom of my Father, how great will be your joy if you should 
bring many souls unto me!" 

Brethren, sisters; this is our work. We cannot save those 
who are indifferent and careless by preaching to them. We must 
go into their homes. We must bow with them before the Lord, 
and plead with him for their welfare. We must, in the spirit of

love, help them to see the need of obedience and service, for with- 
out serving we cannot develop and keep alive the spirit which God 
has promised to those who have entered the waters of baptism and 
keep his commandments. To me, the greatest privilege in life is 
the opportunity to serve in authority of the priesthood. What 
would become of me if it were not for you, my brethren, and the 
encouragement you give. I find we are all very much alike, and 
need to help each other. We should go out on the highway and 
the byway, so- to speak, and find those who are careless and in- 
different, and labor with them, not by one visit, but day by day, 
in a spirit of love and friendship. Men will not listen if we criticize, 
for criticism seems to bring forth a vigorous defense. But love 
and prayer, offered in the spirit of humility, will touch the heart 
and mellow the soul and eventually bring joy and happiness and 
eternal salvation. It is within our power. ■ It is our right. God 
has given us that mission. May he grant that we shall not fail, 
I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER ELIAS S. WOODRUFF 

President of the Western States Mission 

I have but one desire in my heart at this moment; — that I may find 
favor with my Heavenly Father and be enabled to discharge this duty 
acceptably before him, and for your and my blessing. 

The Saints residing in the Western States Mission, like you at 
home, are beset with the problems of how to live and meet the present 
conditions of life. Many of them are unemployed and are living almost 
alone on hope. Many of them are employed. Those who live in the 
country regions, following agricultural pursuits, are reasonably com- 
fortable and happy. . The rest of them are hoping for relief from present 
conditions, but they are enjoying their worship, and I believe our meet- 
ings have never been better attended than they are at the present time. 
We try to find comfort in the thought that has been expressed here 
today, that all things are for our good. 

As a matter of fact, my brethren and sisters, I think if we will ask 
ourselves the question : What is a blessing? that we will get some comfort 
out of the answer. I remember that once, while I was teaching a class of 
boys in the Forest Dale Ward, the question was asked. I asked them this 
question in return: Of all of Jacob's sons which was the most blessed? 
And the answer came back very promptly — Joseph. Yet Joseph was 
a slave in a foreign land. He was incarcerated in a dark prison. He 
was without friends or kinsfolk, while his brethren were at home enjoying 
the blessings of the land. They had plenty to eat and to spare. They 
had their houses and their farms, their lands and their possessions. But 
Joseph was in favor with God. His spirit was in tune with the Holy 
Ghost. He had the companionship of that marvelous influence, and he 
was by far the most blessed. 

The Lord tells us in the thirty-ninth, section of the Doctrine and 
Covenants that his commandments are spiritual ; that he never has 



ELDER ELI AS S. WOODRUFF 



33 



given a temporal commandment to any one, riot even to Adam, our 
father. Therefore I conclude that if we can live so that we can be in 
harmony with our Heavenly Father, no matter what we may be called 
to pass through, or how difficult our trials may seem to be, we are a 
blessed people. If the Latter-day Saints measure themselves by that 
yard-stick, we have, I trust, little to complain about and much to give 
us joy and satisfaction. 

I rejoice that it has been my privilege to be associated with the men 
and women of this Church, both at home and in the mission field, and 
that they have influenced my life. In enjoying their companionship 
I have been brought into a nearer communion with my Heavenly Father. 
I rejoice that the Spirit of the Lord strives with me, that the Lord is 
patient and kind to me, that he seems to overlook my weaknesses and 
to bless me in time of need, and I esteem that a great blessing. So I 
count my blessings, I rejoice and am happy. I have many things to 
rejoice for. 

I am deeply grateful for the experience that I am having and have 
had in my life. I am grateful for the confidence of the Saints with 
whom I associate and labor, and of my brethren and sisters in the ministry 
in that mission. I am grateful for the confidence and love of my brethren 
who preside over me, and for every blessing that I enjoy. Brethren and 
sisters, let us count our blessings, and let us esteem them at their true 
value, and if we do we are a happy people. That we may do that is my 
most humble prayer, in the name of Jesus, Amen. 

ELDER JOHN V. BLUTH 

President of the Canadian Mission 

I bring you greetings, my brethren and sisters, from the Saints and 
the missionaries in the Canadian Mission. We have a small force, but 
they are diligent and faithful. They love their work; they are glad to 
be engaged in the service of the Lord and to give of the talents he has 
given them, unto the blessing and the benefit of the people among whom 
they labor. The fathers and mothers of those sons and daughters need 
not worry over their children. They are doing a good work. They are 
measuring up to the labors and responsibilities assigned unto them. 

I deem it a wonderful privilege for the presidents of the missions 
in the United States, Canada and Mexico, to be permitted to come and 
enjoy these conferences every six months, a privilege that because of 
distance is denied to the presidents of other missions. We here receive 
joy, happiness, strength and vitality in the continuation of our work, 
and we can to some extent imbue our brethren and sisters in the mission 
field with that same spirit. I rejoice in it. 

I have been happy to listen to the things said here this morning and 
this afternoon upon the Word of Wisdom, the necessity of keeping 
our bodies clean, they being the temples of God. We should not abuse 
them; we should have sound bodies for the development of the spirits 
t-hat are within them, for their growth and development. Some say that 
our weaknesses are such we cannot refrain from yielding to these things. 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



That reminds me of a brother in New Brunswick who does not hesitate 
to say, when any one says he cannot quit tobacco, that it is simply because 
he does not want to. "I was," he said, "the most inveterate user of 
tobacco. I cannot conceive how anybody could be more' so than I was. 
I smelled it; I smoked it; I chewed it; I even ate it. Not a moment 
of the time, except at meal times, did I deem I could do without it. I 
heard of the Gospel preached by the Latter-day Saints, of their Word 
of Wisdom. It caused me to wonder. I asked a physician to test my 
blood. He took a portion of it, and sent it to an institute where there 
was an eminent surgeon who analyzed it. When he got the analysis 
or report back the question was asked : 'How long since this man died ?' " 
The chemist did not think it possible that any one so saturated with 
tobacco as that blood test showed him to be could possibly live. When 
he accepted the Gospel he quit, and he has for many years since that 
time been without its use, and he declares it has given him no discomfort 
to leave it alone. He had the will to quit it. The very query as to his 
death brought that determination to him. For that reason he feels that 
all that is necessary is the desire to quit. But when our longings for it 
are greater than our desire to serve God, then of course it is difficult. 

It would seem to me that the very words of our Heavenly Father 
in the revelation read to us this morning, and spoken upon this afternoon, 
leave us in a peculiar position if we cannot live up to them. The counsel 
therein given is "adapted to the capacity of the weak and the weakest of all 
saints who are or can be called saints." When we cannot observe the 
Word of Wisdom we are placed in this position : Either we are weaker 
than "the weakest of all saints," or else we are deliberately sinning. 
"To him that knoweth to do good," says James, "and doeth it not, to him 
it is sin." And our Father declares : "I the Lord, cannot look upon sin 
with the least degree of allowance." If we can get to understand that, I do 
not see how it is possible for any one with any faith in the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ to belittle the statements made relative to this wonderful revela- 
tion, given unto us for our temporal salvation. 

I would like to say a word bearing upon this and some other things, 
relative to our folks at home. I cannot help but appreciate the wonderful 
sacrifice that fathers, mothers, sisters and brothers, even young children, 
indicate they are willing to make, in order to keep the father, the 
husband, the brother, the son, in the mission field the full time. I marvel 
a$, the efforts they make, the things they endure, and the sacrifices they 
make in order to accomplish it. When the shortage of missionaries brings 
the. request : "Can we keep your son, your daughter, two or three or four 
months longer?" how they strive to comply with it, how they dislike to 
say that they cannot. 

Now, my brethren and sisters, you can preach the Gospel at home 
by the lives that you lead more fully than they can by word of mouth. 
You are sacrificing these things for them, why not get your money's 
worth out of it ? This is what I tell our missionaries : "You know what 
your people are doing for you. Give them their money's worth, by the 
loyalty, the faithfulness, the devotion that you give unto the work of the 
Lord." So also at home : Get your money's worth. Why vitiate their 



ELDER JOHN V. BLUTH 



35 



effort and nullify it by such conduct at home that people, noticing the 
way you act, complain that you do not live what you preach ? 

We love your boys, we love your daughters, who are out in the field 
— neat, tidy, dignified, soft-spoken, living lives of Christians. Then we 
find that sometimes you do not live at home that which they preach. 
Let us preach by our lives that which God has given unto us, that we 
may bear testimony unto the world that the Gospel can really become 
the power of God unto our salvation, if we will abide by its precepts. 
Then we will grow in grace. Love for God's word will be in our hearts. 
Love and devotion for his work will constantly be with us. We will 
serve him. We will win our own reward and our own salvation. 

I rejoice in the work in which we are engaged. My wife and I 
have never been happier than we are at this moment. We finished a 
mission tour of three thousand miles just before I came here to confer- 
ence. We have joy in our labors, and thank God for the privilege of 
serving. We ask his blessing upon all his people, those who are engaged 
in his work, that the work may prosper throughout the world and grow 
to be, as it were, an ensign unto the nations, to look up to, an example Jo 
be followed, that they might be saved temporally and spiritually, and I 
ask it in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

"O ye mountains high" was sung by the congregation. 

ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

A MAGNIFICENT GIFT 

A few weeks ago in company with President Grant, I had the 
privilege of inspecting a very beautiful building. The architecture was 
superb, a rare combination of elegance and utility. In the portal were 
handsome columns of Venetian marble and massive doors of real bronze. 
The main corridor boasted portraits of the old masters in art and science 
done in Italian mosaic. The building housed a great library with com- 
modious reading rooms and studies for the accommodation of students. 
It was said to have cost more than a million dollars. It was the gift 
of a rich man. 

When I saw inscribed on a plaque the name of the man who gave 
it, rather strange thoughts and feelings came to me which I have pon- 
dered a good deal since. The name of the donor is connected with one 
of the most notorious scandals of our country in recent years. I do not 
attempt to pass judgment on him. My knowledge of the facts is not 
sufficient for that, but I do know that some of his associates served 
prison terms for participation in the transactions that are reputed to 
have brought fabulous wealth to this man. . 

Here are some of the thoughts that passed through my mind as I 
contemplated the magnificent gift of an American multi-millionaire to an 
institution of the people. Can a man with money in this great country 
of ours buy immunity for wrong-doing? Does the public have indul- 



36 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



gences for sale, if the price is sufficiently large ? Are we concerned with 
how a man gets his money or merely with how much he has ? Just what 
are the standards of integrity and honesty prevalent among us today? 
These and related questions have occupied my attention considerably. 
I propose them as a basis for some remarks here today. 

MEN MISTRUST MEN 

The President of the United States in a recent utterance said in 
substance that the greatest thing we have to fear is fear itself. I think 
he is right. What gives rise to fear and apprehension? The answer is 
simple, I believe. Lack of confidence. And why lack of confidence? 
Again the answer is simple. Men mistrust men. I do not believe that 
people generally have lost faith in our fundamental institutions. The 
Constitution of the nation is a sacred and revered document to the over- 
whelming majority of Americans. We take immeasurable pride in the 
concepts of liberty, equity and justice which it breathes and protects. 
While there have arisen outspoken opponents of the capitalistic system 
under which we administer our economic order, yet there is certainly no 
such wide-spread and organized public opinion against it as to seriously 
endanger its continuance. People are desirous that it should be regulated 
but not abandoned. 

Ignorance, of course, is a real source of fear but I am convinced 
that with increased facilities for the dissemination of knowledge this 
factor is being perceptibly diminished. 

So I am forced to the conclusion that in the final analysis the one 
chief item which has basically contributed to our present deplorable 
state and continues to retard recovery is distrust in the dependability, 
integrity and honesty of men. After all constitutions, laws and insti- 
tutions are but vehicles for the expression of character in the men and 
women of any state or society. Incorporeal rights may be important 
but their administrators are infinitely more tangible. We may argue 
about principle, but it is a man who takes our money or puts us in jail. 
It becomes important to bring out into the open some of the causes and 
conditions which have contributed to a state of public distrust and, re- 
grettable as it may seem, a dearth of common honesty. 

MODERN BUSINESS METHODS 

In this connection I feel sure that the methods of modern business 
have played a very conspicuous part. In many jurisdictions where 
horse-racing, dog-racing, lotteries and slot machines have been penalized 
by law, business gambling has been among the most respectable of all 
vocations. We have experienced the wildest orgy of speculation the 
world has ever known and we are now discovering, according to reports 
following investigations, that the public has been fleeced by misrepre- 
sentation and deceit of enough money to pay the national debt twice 
over. Misrepresentation is the usual concomitant of gambling and I 
think of all get-rich-quick schemes. The principle of honesty seems to be 
inherent in sound labor, but it is ordinarily conspicuous by its absence 
in the manipulations that bring returns without work. 



ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 



37 



Now the most serious aspect of this period of speculation is prob- 
ably not the loss of the huge sums of money involved. I believe it to be 
rather a demoralization of hundreds of thousands of citizens of our own 
and other countries. They have seen millionaires made and unmade 
overnight. Those who have profited in many instances have concluded 
that good work and honesty do not pay, that is, not nearly so generously 
as manipulation. Those who have lost are frequently embittered and 
resolve on equally unworthy schemes of recoupment and reprisal against 
the system from which they have suffered. Mutual confidence has 
received a great set-back because common honesty has been depreciated. 

LACK OF CORPORATE HONOR 

It is a strange thing that many men will do in corporate or group 
capacity what they would not dare to do individually. Corporations and 
syndicates are born for the promotion of enterprises and schemes to 
which men contribute their money and their names when individually 
these same men would not sell the same schemes to friends and neighbors. 
There are sound indications that the group consciousness has been dulled. 
This too is demoralizing to individual standards of honesty. Until we 
become as scrupulous for corporate honor as for individual honor, busi- 
ness as a whole will continue under a moral cloud. 

THE LEGITIMATE FUNCTION OF BUSINESS 

I am not sure but that there prevails pretty generally a serious 
misconception with reference to the legitimate function of business. So 
much emphasis has been laid upon competition, that many have reached 
the conclusion that only the strongest can survive and that it is proper 
to do anything to survive. Until business shall come to be regarded as 
the beneficent agent for the conversion of human energy and the ele- 
ments of the universe into things of necessity, convenience and beauty, 
with equitable recognition of all factors involved, it will ever be a fertile 
source of deceit and misrepresentation. What a pity it should be so. 
The very foundation upon which the substantial businesses of the world 
have been built is good character. Honor and dependability are the 
bases of credit the world over, and credit is the life-blood of business. 

LACK OF POLITICAL HONOR 

Much as I hesitate to reflect upon our government, I cannot refrain 
from calling attention to governmental practises which I am sure have 
contributed to the decline of private and public honor. The old saying 
that all is fair in love and war seems to be painfully applicable to politics 
as well. Since no campaign is in progress at the present time, one can 
speak without great hazard of being accused of partisan motives. False 
representations of persons and parties, innuendoes and half truths de- 
signed to besmirch character, and promises given with no intention of 
fulfilment, are all so common in our political procedure that our inclina- 
tion is to suspect rather than to believe, and we seldom take a candidate, 
party or promise at face value. Sectionalism, trading for advantage and 



38 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



pork barrel legislation have degraded our politics to such an extent that 
real statesmanship is indeed at a premium. With hundreds of thousands 
of persons in the nation directly or indirectly feeding at the public crib, 
utilizing every available means at their disposal, either fair or foul which 
may escape the penalties of the law, for the retention of their positions, 
and with other hundreds of thousands seeking to displace them, npt 
imbued in the main with any motives other than to put themselves in 
lucrative positions ; will any one contend that such conditions have not 
tended to reduce materially the standards of public and private integrity 
throughout the country? 

So long as public patronage continues to be the major item in public 
service, it cannot be otherwise. So long as we tolerate a system of 
political ethics which permits a man to brazenly announce his own 
candidacy and more brazenly still appeal and contrive for public support 
to win for himself an office as if it were a personal perquisite, so long as 
men call themselves instead of awaiting the call of country, we can 
scarcely hope for better days in the cause of common political honor. 

DEMORALIZING INTEGRITY OF OUR CITIZENSHIP 

I am driven to the conclusion, much as I should like to avoid it and 
the reflection which it entails, that the great institution of politics which 
in its true essence is the science of civil government has harbored so 
much of personal and group selfishness, so much of craftiness, chicanery, 
misrepresentation and vilification to gain the ends of self-seekers, that it 
must be counted as one of the large contributing factors in the demoral- 
ization of the integrity of our citizenship. You know and I know that 
many of the country's best and most capable men positively decline 
participation in political affairs for reasons which I have mentioned. 
It is a great pity. We all suffer because of it. I wish we might rectify 
such conditions. I believe that there is a serious-minded disposition on 
the part of great numbers of our citizens to do so. The times are 
fortuitous for a change. God grant that it may come speedily. 

In saying the things I have said it is not my purpose to cast reflec- 
tion upon all of our public servants. There are many notable exceptions 
to the general Observations I have made, but they are exceptions un- 
fortunately. They are not the rule in American politics today. 

USING RELIGION FOR ULTERIOR PURPOSES 

And now I propose to discuss briefly the influence of religion on 
the questions I have propounded for your consideration. It may seem 
almost sacrilegious to mention it in the same breath with business and 
politics as a possible contributor to some of our moral maladies, but I 
must tell you frankly that I honestly believe it has its place in that 
category. Not that religion itself is censurable, but false and insincere 
professors of religion have dealt blows to the cause of moral honesty 
that are even more disastrous than those arising out of business or 
politics, and this for the reason that religion reaches deeper into the 
moral fiber of man than the other items which deal chiefly with tempor- 
alities. 



ELDER STEPHEN L. RICHARDS 



There is no deceit like religious hypocrisy. There is no crook coni-. 
parable to the pious crook. I hesitate to use these extreme terms but I 
cannot conceal my contempt for the man who imposes on his fellows 
under a church cloak — whose life is a spiritual lie. I hope there are 
not many such in the world. I think they are relatively few but there 
have been altogether too many who have used religion for ulterior pur- 
poses. In so doing they have done infinitely more than merely to bring 
injury to themselves and the victims of their deceit. They have served 
as perhaps nothing else has done to destroy faith and confidence in 
religion itself and in the virtues which it supports. 

I am one who believes that revealed religion is the real mother of all 
true morality. Certainly for mankind in general, religious conviction is 
the firmest prop of his goodness. To destroy the prop is to endanger the 
collapse of the whole moral and ethical structure which rests upon it. 
I believe that throughout all time the greatest enemies of religion have 
been found within and not out of the churches. One man professing 
religious allegiance and devotion but living a lie can do more to tear 
down faith and loyalty and plant the seeds of distrust and deceit than 
many good men can repair with arduous labors. 

EFFECT OF UNRIGHTEOUS EXERCISE OF SPIRITUAL POWER 

I hope I shall not give offense if I venture some applications of this 
principle. The man who uses the influence and prestige of his eccle- 
siastical office for the furtherance of personal and selfish interests, injures 
the cause of religion and sows the seeds of dishonesty. Spiritual power 
is the most sacred power entrusted to man. It is given for holy pur- 
poses. If it is exercised "in any degree of unrighteousness," "amen to 
the priesthood or the authority of that man." Not only is his priestly 
action vitiated but he has done irreparable injury to the cause of religion 
itself. Thousands of honest people not able to distinguish between the 
hypocrisy of men and the cause itself have turned a deaf ear to the appeal 
of truth. Stories and plays built around the theme of the pretending, 
insincere worshiper have been a deterrent to faith in men for ages 
past. Such circumstances seem hard on religion, but are the conclusions 
not justified? Who should be held to a higher degree of accountability 
than the one who professes to have received absolute knowledge of God's 
truth. 

THE STANDARDS OF A RELIGIOUS MAN 

It is the truth that makes men free, free from ignorance, free to 
choose the right. It is the truth — the knowledge of things as they were, 
as they are and as they will be which gives to men vision, understanding 
and wisdom. It is reasonable that more should be expected of those who 
have the truth. Can a man who has testimony of the truth lie a little, steal 
a little, or malign his neighbor with impunity? Who sets the standard 
for a religious man ? Is it the community in which he lives, the customs 
which have become prevalent? No. His standards are set in the reve- 
lations of God. Through his faith he hears the commandments of the 
Lord declared from Sinai resounding down through the ages : "Thou 



40 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



shalt not steal." "Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor." 
He knows that these injunctions are unequivocal and eternal. He knows 
that they are the foundation of virtue and he knows that they are essen- 
tial to the eternal welfare of the race. Of course, more is expected of 
the religious man. 

CHARGED WITH AN IMPORTANT RESPONSIBILITY 

Fellow members of the Church, I may overestimate our position 
in the world, our opportunities and responsibilities, but I declare it as 
my solemn conviction that no other organization is charged so definitely 
with the responsibility of sustaining the true and eternal standards of 
virtue in the world as is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
We know that these standards are imperiled today but I confidently believe 
that if it can be demonstrated that three-quarters of a million people 
scattered through the nations of the earth, giving allegiance to the prin- 
ciples of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, can live honest, dependable lives, 
resisting all untoward temptations and influences, that demonstration will 
serve to convince the teeming millions of the earth that they can do like- 
wise. 

We can make that demonstration in one way only. By being what 
we profess to be^— disciples of the Christ. How it hurts me, how it 
injures our cause to see a man, a member of the Church, steal from an 
employer, default in public office, obtain money by false pretenses, cheat 
in business, repudiate an honest obligation, lie and deceive for political 
or other gain. Why, the work of a hundred missionaries can scarcely 
make amends for the criticism and shame thrown on the people of the 
Church by one bishop who violates his trust in public office. The loss 
of money is insignificant compared with the loss of honor. We can 
and we will recoup our financial misfortunes but it will be most difficult 
for us to regain our enviable reputation for fair and honorable dealing 
if we ever lose it. I pray God we never will. 

I think if I were permitted to offer one prayer only for my brothers 
and sisters it would be this : O God, keep us honest under the pressure 
these hard times have laid upon us. Let us be true to all men and to 
Thee. Amen. 

ELDER SAMUEL O. BENNION 

Of the First Council of Seventy and President of the Central 
States Mission 

I pray that I may be led to say that which the Lord would 
have me say on this occasion for our good. There is an excellent 
spirit among the Latter-day Saints and I do appreciate the oppor- 
tunity I have had for a goodly number of years of coming home to 
attend the conferences of the Church and to partake of that spirit. 

I believe with all my heart, my brethren and sisters, that the 
mission of this Church is to carry the Gospel of salvation to the 
children of men, for their benefit, not only here but in the eternities 



ELDER SAMUEL 0. BENNION 



41 



to come ; this is a responsibility laid upon our shoulders by our 
eternal Father. 

I believe, too, that we learned this Gospel plan before we came 
into the world ; that we participated in the great program that the Lord 
arranged for the benefit of his children when they should come upon 
the earth. And men endowed with the spirit which responds to 
that plan are yet scattered among the nations of the earth, waiting 
for the Gospel to reach them. 

It has been my responsibility for a number of years to play my 
part in the preaching of the Gospel, and I have taken a great deal 
of pleasure in it. I have no question whatever in my mind as to 
the divinity of the great calling of Joseph Smith, the Prophet. I 
am positive that he received that which he said he did from our 
Father in Heaven, and that our eternal Father and his Son Jesus 
Christ appeared unto him in this dispensation and revealed unto 
him the true order of worship. This has been made known through 
the Prophet to thousands of men and women from that time until 
now. The evidences of it I see continually in the history of this 
Church, a history that must attract the attention of the children of 
men who are honest. Men and women who are seeking for the 
better things in life are being led to the great door of opportunity, 
by investigating the Gospel of Jesus Christ. 

We have a hundred years of history which must stand out as 
an assurance to all honorable men that no body of people could 
operate or live as long as this Church has done and make the 
progress that it has made in the world if it were not divinely guided 
and inspired. Its doctrines have never been successfully assailed. 

I love the children of men. I believe that I owe it to men 
everywhere to do all that I can to lead them back into the path of 
duty. I know they kept their first estate, else they would not be 
here. And I know that the future life of all men rests largely upon 
their work here in mortality. This period of time allotted to us is 
a temporary existence, one where we can prove ourselves unto the 
Lord and unto our fellow men ; where we can take advantage of 
that which the Lord has revealed. It is a marvelous thing to be 
able to live in this world, to have the experience of being taber- 
nacled in a body of flesh and bones, taking upon oneself the responsibility 
of life, the making of a world in a temporal way, accomplishing this 
through the power of our eternal Father. 

There is nothing in all of his creation greater than the sons 
and daughters of God. The youth of our country are most appeal- 
ing. In my travels among the children of men I am greatly im- 
pressed by the boys and the girls with whom I come in contact. 
When I attend to my prayers morning and night I pray for the 
youth of Zion. I pray that they may turn unto the Lord. I pray 
that wise men may be raised up to lead them along paths that are 
safe, that they may be able to enjoy the great opportunities that 
are theirs. 

It is a glorious privilege to know that God lives ; to be able to 



42 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



testify of him without fear. 1 never saw Joseph Smith or his brother 
Hyrum with mortal eyes, or any of those who laid the foundations 
of Zion. I never knew Brigham Young, only as I have read of 
him, but I know that he and those before him labored under the 
direction of God the Father, and that they established his work in 
the earth; and that those who followed them, from then until now, 
have had that same power and influence and authority. 

There can be no failure at all on the part of the Lord's work, 
if men and women will do their part. I have faith and confidence 
in the people of this Church and in the priesthood. I am sure that 
they are men of God, and that he is training them for the great 
events that are to take place in the further establishment of his 
work. I am not at all worried over the success of this Church. I 
know that if we will do our part, if we will be true to him in the 
calling whereunto we have been called, our eternal Father can 
accomplish his purposes much faster than otherwise. 

I hope, my brethren and sisters, that I may be able to live up 
to the requirements that have been made of me and the appoint- 
ment that I have received this day. I can do it if I do my part, 
and if the brethren and sisters of the Church will do that which 
I hope they will, sustain me as they do all others who are in posi- 
tions of trust, either in the wards or stakes of Zion, or in the 
leadership of this Church. May we all stand for God our eternal 
Father and those whom he has selected to represent him here in 
the earth. 

I hope the congregation that was here this morning will read 
and re-read the address that was made by President Heber J. 
Grant ; and that men and women in all parts of the world will 
read it. People who are not honest in their hearts will not be 
swerved by it, but those who are sincere will be touched and led to 
believe in that great doctrine that was taught here today by a 
prophet of the living God. It will bring to their souls evidence 
that God lives and that he speaks through the mouths of his 
servants and gives unto them the evidence that they may find him 
if they so desire. 

A There are millions of men and women in this world who are 
intelligent and morally good, if they can only be reached. We pray 
that the doctrines of this Church may go to the honest in heart 
through the mouths of those who are appointed to preach it, and 
through the living of it by those who have received it as the truth. 
To this end I pray, in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

The congregation sang the hymn, "O say what is truth?" 
Elder William J. Henderson, President of the Panguitch Stake, 
pronounced the benediction. 

Conference adjourned until 10 o'clock Friday morning, April 7. 



SECOND DAY 



MORNING MEETING 

The third session of the Conference was opened promptly at 10 
o'clock a. m., by President Heber J. Grant announcing that the congre- 
gation would sing the hymn, "How firm a foundation, ye Saints of the 
Lord." 

After the singing of this hymn, Elder Byron O. Colton, President 
of the Roosevelt Stake, offered the opening prayer. 

A duet, "The Morning Land," was sung by Miss Rae Miles and 
C. T. Packard. 

ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

In rilling a Sunday appointment some years ago to speak in the 
Tabernacle and while talking I incidentally mentioned our life before 
we came here upon the earth. I do not remember just the expression 
used, but I was not discoursing particularly upon the subject of man's 
pre-existence. I perhaps made the statement that we ought to be as faith- 
ful and valiant in this life as we were in the life before We came here. 
At any rate at the conclusion of the meeting, as I walked down the steps 
from the pulpit I was met by a small group of tourists, one of whom, 
a well-dressed and intelligent woman of middle age, seemed to be the 
spokesman for the group. After making a few comments of a com- 
plimentary character, this lady made the astounding statement that she 
was a relative of the former Confederate President of the United States, 
Jefferson Davis ; that her father was a minister of the gospel, and that 
his father before him was also a minister of the gospel, and that she 
had been a regular attendant at church services all her life, but never 
before had she heard taught or suggested that man had a living exist- 
ence before coming here upon the earth. 

PRE-EXISTENCE NOT UNDERSTOOD 

I think perhaps I was as much surprised at hearing her make this 
statement as she was in hearing what I had said about pre-existence. 

The principle of man's pre-existence is so well established by the 
Old and New Testaments, as well as the other standard works of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, that it seemed to me almost 
impossible that men who had studied for the ministry, and who are sup- 
posed to interpret the word of the Lord as contained in the Bible, could 
be misled or be unable to see that principle plainly. I have since made 
inquiry in my travels and in my association with those who are not of 
our faith and have found that Christian people generally do not believe 
in nor do they understand the principle of man's pre-existence. 

One minister with whom I talked at considerable length while riding 



44 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



on a railroad train, at the conclusion of our conversation said that it might 
be that Jesus Christ had a former existence, but that he could not admit 
that much of men generally. Inasmuch as this principle of man's pre- 
existence is so fundamental in the plan of the Gospel and is a key to 
the understanding of many passages of scripture without which they 
could not be properly understood, I thought I might speak upon this 
subject this morning. 

A SPIRITUAL CREATION 

I call attention to the very first chapter in Genesis, which gives an 
account of the creation of the earth and of vegetation upon the earth, 
of animals and also of man, and which is really a spiritual creation, but 
which men and women seem not to have understood. In this account we 
read that God said: "Let us make man in our image, after our like- 
ness." It plainly tells us that man was created in the image and 
likeness of his Maker. And then after the account is given we are told 
that the Lord rested from his labors on the seventh day. 

It would seem that everything pertaining to the creation had been 
then completed. But when we read the second chapter of Genesis we 
find that what is recorded in the first chapter is an account of a spiritual 
creation. 

"These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were 
created, in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens, 

"And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of 
the field before it grew : for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, 
and there was not a man to till the ground. 

"But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the 
ground. 

"And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into 
his nostrils the breath of life ; and man became a living soul." 

Notwithstanding an account had been given in the first chapter of 
the creation of man and of other things, the second chapter of Genesis 
gives an account of the creation of all those things that had been created 
spiritually. This would seem to be sufficiently plain that men and women 
studying it would be able to reach a conclusion that the earth and all 
things pertaining to it — vegetation, animals and man — had really a spirit- 
ual creation. 

In the Book of Moses, in the Pearl of Great Price, is given an 
account of the spiritual creation as the Lord revealed it to Moses : 

"And 1 , the Lord God, had created all the children of men ; and not yet a man 
to till the ground; for in heaven created I them; and there was not yet flesh 
upon the earth, neither in the water, neither in the air ; * * * 

"All things were before created; but spiritually were they created and made 
according to my word." (Moses 3) 

We have additional information pertaining to this great principle 
in our standard works that helps to make more plain and easy to be 
understood this very important principle. 

WAR IN HEAVEN 

In the last book of the New Testament we have an account of the 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 45 

war which took place in heaven, which of course could not have been 
had there not been people engaged in it. In the twelfth chapter of the 
Book of Revelation we read as follows : 

"And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the 
dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels, 

"And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven. 

"And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and 
Satan, which deceiveth the whole world : he was cast out into the earth, and his 
angels were cast out with him." 

Speaking of the dragon, we read in the fourth verse : 

"And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them 
to the earth." 

So that we understand without any further revelation that this 
same Lucifer was the one who rebelled in heaven, and he was cast out and 
with him one-third of heaven's host. 

In Jude 1 :6 we read : 

"And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habita- 
tion, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of 
the great day." 

OUR RELATIONSHIP TO GOD 

In Hebrews 12 :9 we have a reference to the relationship we sustain 
to God : 

"We have had fathers of our flesh which have corrected us, and we gave them 
reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, 
and live?" 

I wonder how men and women can read such scriptures and not 
understand pre-existence. 

THE PRE-EXISTENCE OF CHRIST 

We read in the first chapter of John : 

"In the begnining was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word 
was God. 

"The same was in the beginning with God. 

"All things were made by him ; and without him was not anything made that 
was made." 

John here refers to the Son of God, as expressly stated in another 
verse of that chapter: 

"And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us." 

So that we might read that scripture, "In the beginning was Jesus 
Christ, and he was with, God, and he was God" — thus showing a plurality 
of Gods, or in other words, God the Father, and God the Son. "All 
things were made by him, and without him was not anything made that 
was made." 

FIRST-BORN AND CREATOR OF HEAVEN AND EARTH 

Even before he was born into this world as a babe in Bethlehem, 



46 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



he must have had an existence and a power, even that of a God, to create 
the heavens and the earth and all things therein. 

The Apostle Paul in writing to the Colossians makes a similar 
statement, that all things were created by him, visible and invisible. He 
makes a further statement that he was the first-born, which expression 
implies at once that there were others born as well as he of the same kind 
of birth. It is clear that no reference is made there to his birth in the 
flesh, for he came in the meridian of time. It was some other birth, 
and What other but that when he was born of his eternal Father in the 
spirit as we were born? And thus this principle is established — the 
Fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man. How men who do not 
understand the principle of pre-existence can understand the Fatherhood 
of God and the brotherhood of man I cannot comprehend. 

LOVE OF GOD AND FELLOW MEN 

We read in the scriptures that the first great commandment is that 
we shall love the Lord our God with all our heart, with all our soul and 
with all our mind ; and the second is like unto it, we shall love our neigh- 
bor as ourselves, remembering that blood is thicker than water, and that 
things earthly are typical of things heavenly. We know that by reason 
of the relationship we sustain to God our Heavenly Father and to our 
fellow men we should love them — love the Lord with all our heart and 
that sincerely, and love our fellow men and serve them, because they 
are in very deed our brothers and our sisters. 

ONE INDIVIDUAL FROM BEGINNING TO END 

By an understanding of this principle of pre-existence we under- 
stand the evolution of man, if that is a correct expression, or his eternal 
progress, following in the footsteps of the Savior, the First-born, being 
born of God in the spirit, having a spiritual existence and then coming 
here upon the earth to have an earthly existence, passing on through 
death to another spiritual existence, and then the resurrection, and 
through faithfulness and obedience to the laws and ordinances of the 
Gospel go on to eternal life and exaltation. There is just the one indi- 
vidual from beginning to end. The fallacy of the reincarnation of man 
theory is here made apparent, as also the doctrine of evolution, in which 
it is taught that man originated with the lower animals, the very lowest 
type, and came up by degrees. 

We rejoice in the knowledge of the Gospel, that we are of noble 
ancestry, that we are indeed sons and daughters of God ; and understand- 
ing this we realize what manner of men we ought to be, which could 
not be understood but for this knowledge of pre-existence. The origin 
of man is here set forth as well as his eternal progression. The origin 
of the Gospel of Jesus Christ is hereby understood as taught in the 1 
scriptures. 

BEFORE THE WORLD WAS 

The Prophet Joseph Smith made use of this expression : 
"At the first organization in heaven we were all present and saw the Savior 



ELDER GEORGE F. RICHARDS 



47 



chosen and appointed and the plan of salvation made, and we sanctioned it." 
(Compendium, p. 288) ........ 

His statement is confirmed by scripture as follows : 

Revelations 13:8: "And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose 
names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation 
of the world." 

Also I Peter 1:19, 20: "But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb 
without blemish, and without spot : who verily was foreordained before the foun- 
dation of the world. 

The proper interpretation is of course that in the council of heaven 
before the world was, Christ our Lord, was chosen to be the Savior of 
mankind, to come in the meridian of time. He is characterized all through 
the scriptures as the Lamb of God, the Lamb without blemish. And 
when God gave Adam a charge to build an altar and offer a sacrifice, it 
was a type of that sacrifice which was to be made by the Lamb of God. 
It was to be a lamb, one of the firstlings of the flock and without blemish. 
How beautifully it represents the Son of God ! 

The purpose of his being chosen before the world was is explained 
in the scripture as follows (I Cor. 15 :21, 22) : 

"For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the 
dead. 

"For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive." 
THE AUTHOR OF SALVATION 

This shows that the fall was understood as a part of this great plan 
of the Gospel before the world was, and provision was made to redeem 
mankind from the fall. 

We read further (Heb. 5 :8, 9) : 

"Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he 
suffered; 

"And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all 
them that obey him." 

It must have been understood then tha t the atonement which .he was 
to work out when he should come upon the earth should be the means of 
redeeming mankind from their sins on condition of obedience unto the 
laws and ordinances of the Gospel, as set forth in the third article of 
our faith : 

"We believe that through the atonement of Christ all mankind may be saved 
by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel." 

THE PLAN OF SALVATION 

This is a part of the Gospel which was instituted in the heavens. 
We have no account of God instituting any other Gospel, any other plan 
of salvation, and anything in conflict with that plan as there ordained 
and taught by Christ our Lord and his disciples will be contrary to the 
mind and will of God and calculated to lead men away from rather than 
to the Lord and the plan of salvation itself. Just one Lord, one faith, 
one baptism — God the Eternal Father, and Jesus Christ his Son, .the 
Savior of the world. .•• ■'-

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



I feel grateful in my soul for this light that has come to us in 
connection with all the other light and knowledge of the Gospel which 
we have received. 

GOD AT THE HELM 

I know, brethren and sisters, of the truth of this work. I know that 
it will endure. For a century men have tried to disprove its truth — in- 
telligent men, learned men — and they have signally failed. They ever 
will. This work is to go on, it is God's work, he is at the helm and) 
directing it, and those who are at the head of the Church here on the 
earth are his vicegerents. At the present time, Heber J. Grant, the 
President of this Church, as the prophet, seer and revelator and God's 
mouthpiece to this Church, is directed by the same spirit that has di- 
rected his predecessors, and this work has never halted for a moment 
from its inception until the present time. It never will, it will go on 
until God's purposes shall have been fully consummated, until our Lord 
shall come and take possession of this, God's kingdom upon earth, and 
shall rule as King of kings and Lord of lords. 

May the Lord add his blessing' to this testimony, I ask in the name 
of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

IF WISDOM IS LACKING 

A boy, age fourteen, was troubled in his mind about religion ; he 
was uneasy. At times he was greatly excited. There was tumult every- 
where in his neighborhood. In this confusion and distress, although but 
a lad in years, this wise young man sought the Holy Bible. 

The whole world today is likewise in confusion. Men's hearts are 
failing them. Their lives are filled with despair. Many are unemployed, 
multitudes discouraged. How many of these, and perhaps it may be well 
for me to say, how many of us, during these trying conditions, have gone 
to this great, this good, this Holy Book in search of something that will 
point the way? 

The boy opened the Holy Book to the first chapter of James and 
read : 

"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men 
liberally, and upbraideth not ; and it shall be given him." 

ASK OF GOD 

Again and again he reflected upon these divine words. He was 
certain that if any one ever needed wisdom he needed it then. How to 
act he did not know. He concluded that unless he could get more light, 
more wisdom, he would never know. At length came the conclusion 
that he must either remain in darkness or else do as James suggested, 
ask of God. This young man therefore retired to the woods to make 
the effort. It was on a clear day early in the spring of 1820 and it was 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 



49 



his first attempt to pray vocally. The result, as you all know, was 
miraculous. 

In the confusion of the world today, no leader or group of leaders 
seems to have the necessary wisdom, the necessary vision to lead or to 
point or to find the way out. Ought not all the people, therefore, to turn 
to the first chapter of James and read, with faith believing, those divine 
words : 

"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men 
liberally, and upbraideth not ; and it shall be given him." 

WHO HAS FORGOTTEN GOD? 

Are you praying ? Am I praying? Are the members of the Church 
as a whole praying? Do all who go upon their knees have in their hearts 
genuinely the prayerful spirit, the spirit of faith and humility? Are the 
words they utter a real, a heartfelt prayer, or are they but words thought- 
lessly or carelessly spoken? In the language of Lincoln, is it possible 
that the people of the world, those of our nation, and perhaps some of 
the members of our own Church, have really forgotten God? 

We, as a nation, people of the United States have certainly been 
"the recipients of the choicest bounties of heaven ; we have been preserved 
these many years in prosperity ; we have grown in numbers, wealth and 
power as no other nation has ever grown." 

And during this long period of unusual prosperity have we for- 
gotten the gracious hand that has multiplied and enriched and strength- 
ened us? Have we vainly imagined in the deceitfulness of our own 
hearts, that all of these blessings have been produced by some superior 
wisdom and virtue of our own? Have we been intoxicated with un- 
broken success ? Have we become too self-sufficient to feel the necessity 
of redeeming and preserving grace? Are we of America too proud to 
pray to the God that made us? If these conditions prevail then- truly 
"it behooves us to humble ourselves before the offended power, to confess 
our national sins, and to pray for clemency and for forgiveness." 
(Lincoln) 

"protect us by thy might" 

But speaking to you, my fellow churchmen, looking into your faces, 
let me ask more specifically, have you been upon your knees this morning ? 
Did you express gratitude last night before you went to rest for the 
blessings of yesterday ?! Have we Latter-day Saints earnestly and always 
sought first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness? (Matt. 6:33) 

We are living in a land where we sing, "Protect us by Thy might, 
great God, our King." Ours is the nation whose motto is, "In God we 
Trust." Our statesmen and patriots of the past have set us a noble, 
a worthy example. Washington at V alley Forge went upon his knees 
and appealed for the help of Divine Providence. It was Lincoln who 
said, "it behooves us to humble ourselves before the offended power, 
to confess our national sins and to pray for clemency and forgiveness." 
In those other dark and trying days, he said, the great trouble with our 
nation is "we have forgotten God."

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



OUR PRAYERS HEARD 

. "In the beginning of our contest with Great Britain," said Franklin, "when 
we were sensible to danger, we had daily prayers for divine protection. Our 
prayers were heard and they were graciously answered. * * * I have lived a 
long time; but the longer I live the more convincing proof I see of this truth, 
that God governs in the affairs of men." 

Checking now for a moment on our individual selves, I ask again : 

"Ere you left your room this morning, did you think to pray? In the name 
of Christ our Savior, did you sue for loving favor, as a shield today? When 
your heart was filled with anger, did you think to pray? Did you plead for 
grace, my brother, that you might forgive another who had crossed your way?" 

PARTAKING WORTHILY 

Did you attend your Sacrament meeting' last Sunday ? If so, when 
you partook of the sacrament, did you do it worthily ? How many times 
have you partaken of these sacred emblems since our General Conference 
six months ago? How many times have I partaken of the sacrament, 
and when I have partaken of it, have I done so worthily, with a repent- 
ant, a prayerful spirit? 

PRAYERFUL THOUGHT AND STUDY 

Remember, family prayers simply as a matter of form are not 
enough. A study of the revelations given to the Prophet Joseph con- 
vinces me that inspiration, wisdom, revelation and divine guidance come 
as a result of faith, of fasting and praying and appealing repeatedly to 
the Lord for knowledge and for blessings. In the Doctrine and Cove- 
nants, I have found expressions like the following: 

"The Lord responded to the Prophet's supplication by granting this revela- 
tion." (Section 8.) "It is not sufficient for one merely to ask for a divine gift, 
without prayerful thought and study." (Section 9.) "This revelation was 
received * * * in answer to Joseph's supplication and inquiry." (Section 11.) 
"The Prophet inquired of the Lord. * * * This revelation and the next two 
following were given in answer." (Section 14.) "In response to fervent suppli- 
cation for greater knowledge * * * the Lord gave this revelation." (Section 
18.) Etc., etc. 

One of the commandments given specifically to us in these days says : 

PRAY VOCALLY 

"And again, I command thee that thou shalt pray vocally as well as in thy 
heart; yea, before the world as well as in secret, in public as well as in private. 

"Pray always, and I will pour out my spirit upon you, and great shall be 
your blessing." (D. and C. 19:28, 38.) 

Have we obeyed this teaching ? Are we today living in accordance 
with it ? Are you mothers and fathers in your families praying always ? 

The Lord speaking again to us in this our time and dispensation 
says, "Be diligent in keeping all my commandments, lest judgments come 
upon you, and your faith fail you, and your enemies triumph over you." 
(D. and C. 136:42.) "I give unto you a commandment that ye shall 
continue in prayer and fasting from this time forth," (D, and C. 88:76) 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN 



51 



CRYING FOR FORGIVENESS 

Have we fasted, have we prayed, have we appealed, have we re- 
pented, have we cried unto our Heavenly Father for our shortcomings, 
our imperfections, our weaknesses to be forgiven ? Have we appealed as 
the Prophet Joseph appealed ? Are we humble as well as prayerful ? 
For another commandment says: "Be thou humble; and the Lord thy 
God shall lead thee by the hand, and shall give thee answer to thy prayers." 
(D. and C. 112:10) 

Our Lord the Savior said : "Watch, and pray, that ye enter not into 
temptation." (Matt. 26:41) "Pray without ceasing," the Bible tells us. 
(Thessalonians 5:17) 

Morning, evening, every day, in faith believing, let us all pray, lest 
we enter into temptation. Let us seek the Lord while he may be found. 
Let us call upon him, and let us call earnestly, while he is near. (Isaiah 
55 :6) 

CHEER FOR THE FAITHFUL 

To all who are devoutly religious, to those who remember the 
Sabbath day to keep it holy, to those who partake of the sacrament of 
the Lord's supper regularly and partake of it worthily, to those who go to 
our places of worship frequently and there in their hearts appeal to 
Providence for a forgiveness of their sins, -for strength to overcome 
weaknesses, for vision to see the straight and narrow way and for 
strength to walk therein, to those who close each day's labors with a 
prayer of thanks to Divine Providence and to those who begin the labors 
of the day with an appeal for divine help and light, truly, verily to all 
such "every day is a fresh beginning, every morn is the world made 
new." (Susan Coolidge) 

THE PRAYERFUL SPIRIT 

When these prayers of which I have spoken are offered in the 
family circle, at church, to open a meeting or to close it, and more espe- 
cially when blessings are asked upon the holy sacrament, upon the 
bread or upon the water, there should be silence, a real stillness, all eyes 
ought to be closed, all heads ought to be bowed, all hearts filled with the 
prayerful spirit. These appeals are not to be made by one individual, 
they should be the hope, the faith, the united appeal of all who are present. 
And if in every heart there burns an earnest hope for Providence to hear, 
and for the united appeal to be answered, then every pair of lips should 
express the fervent feeling of each and every heart by saying, Amen 
when the prayer is finished. 

SPEAKERS WITH NO MESSAGE 

There are some who complain that our worshiping assemblies, our 
sacrament meetings, are dry, that speakers often stand before our audi- 
ences "who have no message." Some insist they can learn more by 
remaining at home and devoting themselves to literature than by attend- 
ing church, where, they say, certainly at times, uninteresting and un- 
profitable sermons are preached. 



52 



• GENERAL CONFERENCE 



AN UNFAILING LESSON 

I believe the doctrine taught in my presence long ago by one of the 
General Authorities of the Church to the effect that no human lips can 
preach, no human lips can teach a more important, a more impressive 
or a more effective lesson than can be learned by those who attend the 
humblest sacrament meeting and there partake worthily of the sacrament 
of the Lord's Supper. 

PRAYERFUL REFLECTION 

Those impressive moments, and particularly those during which the 
blessings on the sacrament are asked, should be times of deep and sacred 
and prayerful reflection. Such occasions are opportunities for wrong- 
doers to come into' close communion with the spirit and power of our 
Heavenly Father. With eyes closed, with prayerful hearts, with re- 
pentant spirit, genuine worshipers examine their own lives, their own 
conduct, they review their actions during the week past, they think of 
the unkind words they have spoken, of their unfair dealings, etc. Thus, 
with a humble, a repentant, a sorrowful spirit, the man of weakness, the 
wrong doer, in his heart may say: "Father in Heaven, during the past 
week I have so far forgotten myself as to be unkind to my wife ; I spoke 
sharply to my daughter; I lost my temper and struck my son; I dealt 
unjustly with my neighbor. Father, I am a sinner, forgive me." 

REPENTANT SPIRIT 

He who thus has the sorrowful, the repentant spirit, he who thus 
humbly forsakes his wrong-doing and sins no more shall have his sins 
so thoroughly forgiven that they will not only be completely blotted out 
of the book of remembrance of our Heavenly Father, but they will be so 
genuinely forgiven that even the sinner himself will forget. The strong, 
the satisfying teaching of the scripture, one of the fundamentals of the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ, applies in such a case, for the scripture says, 
"Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow ; though 
they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool." (Isaiah 1 :18.) 

ACTUAL LATTER-DAY SAINTS 

Those who are actually Latter-day Saints, those who are genuine 
Christians, those who thus pray and fast, those who remember the Sabbath 
day to keep it holy, those who appeal earnestly for divine guidance as 
did the Prophet Joseph, and as did our early and distinguished statesmen 
and patriots, will have faith in the Gospel message delivered by Paul in 
the following words : "Ye ought to support the weak, and to remember 
the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than 
to receive." (Acts 20:35) What the nation needs under our present 
economic conditions is to have the souls of the citizens of the country 
touched by the divine spark, the divine testimony which brings into the 
hearts of men a realization of that great fundamental, that unselfish 
Christian truth that it is more blessed to give than to receive. The need 
of the nation and of the world is compliance with the teaching in the 



ELDER RICHARD R. LYMAN

impressive, sacred words read by the Prophet in his boyhood : "If any 
of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, 
and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him." (James 1 :5) 

CONSUMER MUST BE ABLE TO PURCHASE 

The present unsatisfactory financial conditions can only be eliminated 
by the application of this fundamental religious truth, by the unselfish- 
ness of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, by getting into the hands of the con- 
sumer in some way or other an ample, or at least a reasonable amount of 
purchasing power. It is not what a nation produces, it is what the nation 
consumes that brings prosperity. In our mechanical age only approxi- 
mately half of the laboring people of our nation need to be employed in 
order to produce all the manufactured and other products the people of 
the country can reasonably consume. This was demonstrated during 
the World War when a large percentage of our population was engaged 
either in the army or in the manufacture of munitions of war. if half 
of the people working eight hours per day can produce as much as all 
the people can reasonably consume, and further since prosperity can 
return only after purchasing power is placed in the hands of consumers, 
then the man who with average ability applies himself with reasonable 
effort to profitable employment for four hours a day ought to be given 
for said service enough purchasing power to enable him to provide for 
himself and for his family not only the necessities of life, but many of 
life's comforts and perhaps some of the luxuries of our modern, sanitary, 
intellectual and religious life. Until all of the consumers in every part 
of the land are by some method or other provided with a reasonable 
amount of purchasing power, prosperity under the most desirable con- 
ditions cannot return. When this greatly needed, this most happy con- 
dition prevails, when the great masses are provided with a reasonable 
amount of purchasing power, then and not until then will poverty be 
banished from our beloved nation. 

It is said that machinery is producing so much and with such effi- 
ciency that a rayon f actor)- in New Jersey is to be built in which only 
one man will be employed. Unless consumers are provided with pur- 
chasing power there can be no market for the products of this novel, 
remarkable and in fact desirable institution. Why, with men's hands, 
should work be done which machinery can perform ? 

WEALTH DESTROYING ITSELF 

It is reported that in the year 1930 one of our great manufacturers 
received in dividends for himself, for his wife and for his son $44,000,000. 
How can this automobile king expect to dispose of his product if he and 
other leading manufacturers are going to collect in dividends and thus 
hoard and keep out of circulation such tremendous quantities of piled 
up wealth ?' Dividends, profits, or certainly a large percentage of these, 
must be put into the hands of the consumer, thus providing him with 
purchasing power or evidently there can be little or no market for manu- 
factured or other products. When our leading business men learn this 
fact and live in accordance with the lesson it ought to teach, namely, that 



54 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



all of the cash of the country, the purchasing power of the nation, should 
be kept circulating, we shall have a prosperity the like of which the world 
has as yet not known, and we shall then be practising the unselfishness, the 
perfection of the teachings of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. 

COMING OF INCREASED PROSPERITY 

If that $44,000,000 and the fabulous dividends and profits other 
business men have received and hoarded had been divided with the 
people whose labor helped to make these great fortunes possible, if 
these great stores of wealth had been divided with members of the ex- 
tensive sales organizations which reach into every part of our country, 
if this wealth which is actually the purchasing power of the nation had, 
by some means or other, been distributed among those who are con- 
sumers, then the markets everywhere would not only have remained 
good, they would have continued all the time to improve, prices would 
have been maintained, factories would have operated at full capacity and 
prosperity would have gone on continuously with ever-increasing mo- 
mentum. All that has been lacking is practising the simple, unselfish 
principles of the Gospel of the Master. 

UNPRECEDENTED PROSPERITY 

Does it not seem that the great manufacturers, the business men of 
the land have, by selfishly accumulating, by hoarding, by withdrawing 
from circulation these great mountains of piled-up wealth, have been 
following a suicidal policy ? Are they not more or less devoid of that 
Christian spirit which teaches that we ought to support the weak, that 
we ought to remember that it is more blessed to give than to receive ? 

Many of our men of wealth are piling up great fortunes that they 
must give away, that they must distribute, wealth they must divide with 
others, if they provide consumers with the power to purchase, which 
power the people must possess before prosperity can return. Distribut- 
ing thus this accumulated power to buy will with certainty bring our 
great nation into unprecedented prosperity. 

SOLUTION FOR WORLD'S ILLS 

Do you not see therefore that the solution to the ills of the world 
is religion, unselfishness? The need of the country is Christianity. 
We must be unselfish enough to support the weak and to remember to 
practise the words of the Lord Jesus when he said. Tt is more blessed 
to give than to receive. 

RELIGION THE SOLUTION 

The cure for our ills, I say again, is religion. The outstanding need 
of the hour is the unselfishness of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Men must 
learn to love one another. I pray for that day when every man shall 
know every other man for every man's name will be brother. Under 
such conditions we shall unitedly support the weak, and all will live in 
accordance with the words of the Master. Every knee will bow and 



ELDER CHARLES E. ROWAN, JR.

every tongue confess that jesus is the Christ and all the world will 
know that if those who lack wisdom will ask of God it shall be given 
unto them. May this happy day come soon I pray, through Jesus Christ, 
our Lord. Amen.

ELDER CHARLES E. ROWAN, JR. 

President of the Texas Mission 

My brethren and sisters, many years ago, as a young man I 
went out with a group of men hunting. After the first day's hunt 
there were many funny experiences told. One of them was this : 
Two of the hunters were together, two large, fine deer were jumped, 
and one of the men when he got through had all of his cartridges 
by the side of him, none having been fired. He had buck fever, 
ft seems that when I stand in this pulpit I become nervous — I can- 
not help it — and after it is all over I wonder if my cartridges are 
not lying on the floor and nothing said. 

I bow my head with gratitude to my Heavenly Father for 
membership in this Church and for the opportunity I have had of 
coming here and partaking of the splendid spirit and listening to 
the words of inspiration as they have fallen from the lips of these 
divine oracles of our Father in heaven. I thank him for the oppor- 
tunity that has come to me to serve in his great Church. I thank 
him for the privilege I have of laboring as a missionary in the 
Texas Mission, for my association with your sons and daughters 
and with the Latter-day Saints in the Texas Mission who I say 
to you have found God. Hundreds of them bear solemn testimony 
that they have accepted the challenge of Jesus Christ and have 
determined positively that this is his work. 

As I listen to the testimonies of those missionaries, those fine 
men who have been clothed with the holy priesthood of Almighty 
God, and those young sisters who have been divinely appointed to 
minister among the children of men, I am filled with joy and 
gratitude to my Heavenly Father. I feel to pay a tribute here today 
to the youth of Zion. 

When President Grant yesterday morning in that wonderful 
address of his, speaking with reference to the Word of Wisdom, 
mentioned the fact that great blessings would come from observing 
it, I was reminded of an experience that had come to my attention. 
There was recently baptized into the Church in the Texas Mission 
a woman of distinction and prominence, a widow. At the time of 
her husband's death he was president of five banks. She has always 
been a devout woman in one of the popular churches. She made a 
trip throughout the West and came to the city of Salt Lake with one 
of her sons who was a university student. She stopped at one of 
the tourist camps here, and one of the local missionaries called 
at the camp and gave her some literature and invited her to come 



56 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



to the Temple Block. Thanks be to the fine missionaries on the 
Temple Block, they appealed to her, they sold her some literature, 
and she started reading the Book of Mormon. She said she found 
it to be rather dry, but she could not get out of her mind the picture 
of the faces of these ,boys and girls who had been born under the 
covenant, who had been reared by fathers and mothers who had 
kept the Word of Wisdom and they who themselves were keeping- 
it. She said : "They are the most beautiful young people I have 
ever seen. I could not get interested in the book, but as I went 
on through the West into California, into Los Angeles and other 
great cities, I began comparing these children with other children." 
She said to her son: "Surely a religion that can produce such 
fine young men and women as the Latter-day Saint religion pro- 
duces must have something of value in it." 

She wrote a letter to President Grant and sent fifteen dollars 
as a contribution to further the work of Mormonism. President 
Grant sent me the letter with a request thatT call on her or have 
one of the missionaries do so. I had the district president call on 
her, and he spent some time with her and gave her some literature. 
She studied it scientifically, systematically and prayerfully, and in 
due time became thoroughly convinced that Mormonism is divine. 
I say, a fruit of Mormonism as depicted by the best crop in the 
Church, the boys and girls who are living lives of Latter-day 
Saints. 

One of the Elders called on this good woman to baptize her. 
A man came to her home while the missionary was there, seeking 
charity. She gave hundreds of dollars to charity. She made him 
a contribution, and then followed him out wanting to see who had 
brought him to her home. A minister of her church, but not of her 
city, was in the car. She introduced herself to him and said. "I 
am going to join the Mormon Church ; I am going to be baptized." 
He said : "Woman, you are crazy. You do not mean it, you cannot 
mean it." And he told her more than that. He said : "You are 
going to hell." 

She said to him: "Brother, I am earnest and sincere in this. 
I have made a serious study of Mormonism. I have been in Salt 
Lake City and other cities where the Latter-day Saints dwell, and 
I have found them to be honest, God-fearing people, men and 
women who are happy in their homes. Heaven is in their homes. 
I believe that I am doing the proper thing. Will you come in 
and show me where they are wrong?" 

He started to get out of the car, and she said to him : "There 
is a young Elder here now ready to baptize me. He is a fine 
young man, a real Christian boy, and I am sure if you can convince 
him that Mormonism is what you say it is and that he is going to 
hell he will go back to his Christian parents." 

The minister immediately became busy and said : "I am sorry, 
sister, but I cannot go in." He no doubt had met Elders before. 

That experience irritated the woman just a little, so she im- 



ELDER CHARLES E. ROWAN, JR. 



57 



mediately entered the house, called her own pastor, to whom she 
had given hundreds of dollars, and told him what she intended to do. 
To her surprise this preacher very nearly duplicated the words that 
the other minister had uttered. She invited him to her house and 
he was coming until he learned that the missionary was there. 

Thus they let one of their best members go "straight to hell'' 
without coming to put her on the right track. She is happy in the 
Church and sends in her tithing every month regularly. She is 
preaching the Gospel to the bankers, the lawyers, and everyone 
with whom she comes in contact, and primarily this Gospel was 
brought to her attention because of the fine happy faces of our 
youth. 

I am delighted to be engaged in this great work. I am delighted 
to report that our missionaries are well and happy ; that they have 
the Spirit of the Lord with them. I hope and trust that we will 
be able to carry on this great work. We are utilizing as far as pos- 
sible the local people and because of this I find a better feeling 
everywhere. The Saints are more united than they have ever 
been before in the history of the mission. Opportunities are 
greater for presenting the Gospel, and our people in the main are 
happy. 

May the Lord bless you, my brethren and sisters, and to you 
who have sons and daughters in the Texas Mission I say they are 
all well. So far as I know they are all enjoying the Spirit of the 
Lord, and best of all, I have heard each one of them certify in 
words of soberness that he knows that God lives, that Jesus is the 
Christ, that Joseph Smith was a prophet of the living God ; and they 
all revere and reverence these men whom we sustain as prophets, 
seers and revelators, as do I. 

May God bless us all that we may always live and do that 
which is right, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER RULON S. WELLS 

Of the First Council of Seventy 

1 sincerely hope and pray that I may enjoy the favor of the Lord 
while I stand before you for a few moments during this session of the 
Conference. I am greatly impressed when I think of the present con- 
dition of the world, when I contemplate the inhabitants of the earth and 
realize that in these last days the Lord has set his hand to do a marvelous 
work and a wonder among the children of men. In the establishment of 
his Church he has chosen men to be witnesses for him. He has restored 
the priesthood and endowed men with power from on high. He has 
commissioned them to go into all the world and preach the Gospel to 
every creature. 

What a gigantic undertaking, when we think that this Gospel of 
the kingdom must be preached in all the world as a witness before the 
end shall come, and what a responsibility rests upon this great Church 
which God has established. Men and women everywhere must be 



58 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



called to repentance and an opportunity must be given unto them to 
accept the message of life and salvation which God is sending forth 
through his messengers into all parts of the world. It almost looks like 
an impossibility, and so far as human effort is concerned it is impossible. 
Only by the aid of our Heavenly Father, by such instrumentalities as 
he may bring about, would such an undertaking be possible. 

We live in an age of great invention and discovery. Means are 
being revealed by which the word of the Lord may be conveyed unto 
his children in the remotest parts of the earth. The prophets of old have 
foreseen conditions as they exist today. The prophet Isaiah said upon 
one occasion : 

"The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof; because they have 
transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant." 

That is a condition that still prevails in the world to a very large 
extent. The work of the Lord is to overcome this condition for it is his 
purpose that sin and iniquity shall be banished from the face of the earth 
and that it shall be sanctified from all unrighteousness, that it may be 
prepared for the celestial glory which is the destiny of this earth upon 
which we dwell. How 'can this reformation be effected, or what shall 
be the method of doing it ? The Lord employs and always has employed 
at least two separate methods. One of them is based upon fear and the 
other one is based upon love. The Lord has given commandments many, 
and disobedience to them brings punishment and penalty. In these mat- 
ters the element of fear is brought to bear, but he has also made wonderful 
promises unto those who render obedience to the will of the Lord, not 
so much out of the sense of fear of the consequences, but with the love 
of God in their hearts and the desire to be in harmony with him. One 
we may call the lesser law and the other the higher law. In ancient 
Israel this lesser law was particularly brought in vogue upon the children 
of Israel. Great commandments were given and punishments were in- 
voked upon those who were disobedient ; the wages of sin were death, and 
great judgments were poured out upon evil doers. 

The children of Israel, during their four hundred years of bondage 
in the land of Egypt, became so contaminated in Egyptian idolatry that 
they were unprepared for the higher law and therefore were given the 
lesser law "as a school master to bring us to Christ." In both the higher 
and the lesser law, however, obedience to the commandments is required 
— the difference lies in the impelling motive. If we obey the command- 
ments because of the fear of the dire consequences — the prescribed penal- 
ties and punishments — very well, we shall receive our reward. We shall 
escape the judgments. But if we live above this lesser law rendering 
obedience to his commandments in our unbounded love for God and our 
fellowmen, then we also shall escape the judgments, but what is of far 
greater importance, we shall also receive eternal life or salvation in his 
celestial kingdom. 

With every dispensation, however, the Lord has employed both 
methods, and he has sought to win through love those who were willing 
to hearken unto his will. The introduction of this Gospel in the day and 
age in which we live was foreseen by the beloved Apostle John upon the 



ELDER RULON S. WELLS 



59 



Isle of Patmos when he saw the angel flying through the midst of heaven 
having the everlasting Gospel to proclaim unto every nation, kindred, 
tongue and people, crying with a loud voice, "Fear God and give glory 
to him for the hour of his judgment is come." In this we find the Lord 
employing in his mercy the element of fear, saying unto the inhabitants 
of the earth that the hour of his judgment is at hand. Must we despise 
the element of fear? Not so, it is a great motive — the fear of the Lord 
is the beginning of wisdom. It is a good thing, a wholesome thing, to 
fear the consequences of doing evil. We must not despise it, and yet 
there is a higher law, a higher motive — that of love. Both are employed 
by the Lord in every dispensation of his providence. 

Through obedience to the lesser law, the law of carnal command- 
ments, with all of its punishments and penalties, we escape the judg- 
ments ; through compliance with the higher law, the law of love, the law 
of grace, we obtain eternal life. 

"For by grace are ye saved through faith ; and that not of yourselves ; it is 
the gift of God. Not of works, lest any man should boast." 

Oh, how idle it would be for any man to think that he can earn so 
great a reward as eternal life in the presence of God, which means the 
power of endless increase and a never ending dominion that shall flow 
unto us forever and forever ! The Lord knows full well, and we know it, 
that no human being is capable of earning such a high reward. A great 
many men in the secular affairs of life obtain various kinds of incomes. 
We segregate them, we classify them for the purpose of obtaining our 
income taxes. We refer to the one as "earned incomes," and the other 
as "excess incomes." No man can earn a million dollars a year, and 
so our congress and our legislators take cognizance of the fact of what 
men may earn, and they deal more liberally with such incomes, but 
on the other they make greater requirements. 

And so it is. No man can earn eternal life, which is God's greatest 
gift to man. It is a free gift from God. But to whom does he grant that 
precious gift? Not to those who merely obey his commandments because 
they fear the consequences 3 Oh, no, but to those that love him. 

"Blessed is the man [or the woman] that endureth temptation: for when he 
is tried he shall receive the crown of life, [of eternal life] which the Lord hath 
promised to them that love him." (James 1 :12.) 

And again we read : 

"Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of 
man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him." (I Cor. 2 :9.) 

In ancient Israel both methods were applied, but the Church in its 
organized condition was charged with the administration of the lesser 
law and its enforcement by executing its penalties and punishments. In 
these latter days this lesser law is relegated to our civil authorities. The 
Church does not undertake the enforcement of penal law any more 
than by withdrawing fellowship from malefactors. 

"No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the 



60 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



priesthood, only by persuasion, by long suffering, by gentleness and meekness, 
and by love unfeigned." 

This is the higher law. Civil authorities enforce the lesser law. 
Is that not also essential ? Most assuredly yes. Is there anyone who 
would like to see the civil law done away with? Our whole system of 
jurisprudence is based upon the law of fear, and penalties are prescribed 
according to the gravity of the offense. Penitentiaries and prisons are 
built for their punishment, and the hangman's noose and the electric 
chair are prescribed for those who are guilty of capital offenses. Such 
is the need of these things and they are all essential for the welfare of 
mankind. 

The great work of the Lord is to carry the glad tidings to every 
nation, kindred, tongue and people, and to try to bring into the fold 
of Christ all who are willing to abide by the laws of God. That is the 
work of saving human souls. What a great undertaking that is ! What 
a tremendous work! How hopeless it would be from any human point 
of view! How grateful then we ought to be that we have been made 
participants in this great work, this great Gospel which has within it the 
power of God unto our salvation. How grateful we ought to be that 
we have become members of the Church and kingdom of God, that we 
have part in that divine power and influence that enables us to go on 
to perfection. 

The Lord has admonished us, "lie ye therefore perfect, as your 
Father- in heaven is perfect." Those who have embraced the Gospel 
should endeavor to so live that they may grow in the knowledge of God 
and good works and that they may become better men and better women 
day by day. Do we suppose that we are already prepared for the celestial 
glory? I hope we are all making progress toward that perfection that 
God will require when we enter into his celestial kingdom. If we are 
to become members of that kingdom we shall have to sanctify ourselves 
from all unrighteousness. Isaiah told us that the world was defiled 
under its inhabitants. This world must become sanctified under its 
inhabitants. Will all men receive the Gospel by which they can become 
sanctified? What is a sanctified person? A holy being, one who has 
been sanctified from all unrighteousness is a saint. The Lord has per- 
mitted 11s to be called saints. Are we that? The Gospel provides the 
means whereby we may become that. Let us abide that law and endeavor 
from time to time to sanctify our souls from all unrighteousness, for we 
may rest assured that the destiny of this earth, is to be sanctified from all 
unrighteousness, therefore it must be under the inhabitants thereof. But 
all will not accept of that Gospel. Then what is to become the lot of the 
remainder who will not become sanctified and be prepared for the celestial 
glory? They shall be utterly destroyed from the face of the earth, the 
prophet told us. What will become of them in the great hereafter? I 
shall not attempt to say. But this earth is to be sanctified and receive 
its paradisaical glory and become a habitation for sanctified beings, a fit 
place for God and his Son to dwell among us and where we may enjoy 
their companionship throughout the ages of eternity. 

Then let us love the Lord with all our heart and may his grace be 
unto you and me, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 

Presiding Bishop of the Church 

I rejoice with you, my brethren and sisters, in the opportunity to 
attend this conference and to partake of the spirit of this and all meetings 
that have preceded it. I rejoice that I am in the enjoyment of health 
and strength, and that the Latter-day Saints generally are in good health. 
I really thought last night that I should not be able to attend conference 
today. I was taken rather suddenly with all the symptoms of influenza 
and at two o'clock this morning I was in such a condition that I thought 
it would be impossible to be here today. But I am happy to say that I was 
able to overcome that condition entirely and am feeling happy and in 
sound health. 

APPRECIATION OF LOYALTY AND COOPERATION 

I appreciate the privileges that have been extended to me in this 
Church. My great desire is to promote every interest of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to the best of my ability and particularly 
those matters that are entrusted to my care. I am sure that is the spirit 
and the feeling of all that are engaged in this work and have the spirit 
of it. I am happy to sustain those two able and devoted men who have 
been appointed and sustained at this conference as General Authorities 
of the Church, as I sustain all of the General Authorities. In like man- 
ner I sustain all of the presiding officers of the stakes, the wards, and 
the missions, and I appreciate the splendid cooperation that we have 
from the stake presidencies, ward bishoprics and mission presidents with 
our office, in all of the temporal affairs of the Church. 

NATION-WIDE BROADCASTS OF CHOIR AND ORGAN 

I would like to call your attention also to the splendid service that 
is being rendered by the tabernacle choir, by the members of the choir, 
by the director and by the organists. Do you realize the fact that this 
choir is not only singing with us in our regular meetings in the taber- 
nacle on Sundays and during General Conferences, but that every Sun- 
day morning all the members of the choir meet and give a nation-wide 
broadcast that is carried over about sixty radio stations throughput 
the United States as well as by short wave to other countries ; that 
millions of people are listening every Sunday morning to this broadcast ; 
that it is giving wonderful publicity to this city and state and is making 
the people of this nation better acquainted with the fact that this Church 
stands for culture and fine music? These members are not only giving 
that service on Sunday morning but they are also giving voluntary 
service in the preparation of these songs ; and the director and the 
organists, of course, in like manner are bending every effort toward 
preparation of the music for these broadcasts ; because it requires largely 
the preparation and presentation of new music from Sunday to Sunday. 
These broadcasts have become so popular that now the Columbia Broad- 
casting System, through whose network these programs are being pre- 



62 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



sented, has requested that the choir produce an hour's program every 
Sunday instead of a half hour as heretofore. 

CHARACTER EDUCATION IN THE HOME 

There are some things that I would like to discuss briefly this morn- 
ing as time may permit. I was greatly impressed with the wonderful 
discourse given by President Grant with regard to the Word of Wisdom. 
My only regret is that so many of the young people to whom this should 
be presented were engaged in school work at the time it was presented 
and did not have the opportunity of hearing it. 

I think that there never was a time when there was so much temp- 
tation and so many allurements for the young people in the way of 
developing habits contrary to the spirit and the teaching of the Word 
of Wisdom as at the present time. I realize the fact that we cannot 
get away from these allurements and temptations. Advertisements are 
being presented in the most insidious way to draw people everywhere, 
young women as well as young men, to do those things which are con- 
trary to the instructions given in the Word of Wisdom. We cannot 
escape those things. We cannot shelter our young people from seeing 
and hearing and reading these advertisements. How then can we help 
them to overcome and enable them to resist temptation?! They are 
bound to meet it wherever they go. It seems to me that there are no 
means so potent as that of character education in the homes of the Latter- 
day Saints, whereby parents teach their children the speciousness of the 
advertisements presented for increased sales of tobacco and of other 
things that we know are not for our welfare. It seems to me that it is 
incumbent primarily on the parents, not particularly to preach to chil- 
dren, but to advise and counsel with them and to inquire of them as to 
their feelings and of the temptations that will come to them, in a kindly 
parental way, endeavoring to show to them the mistaken and false stater 
ments made in such advertisements. 

RESISTANCE TO TEMPTATION 

I am sure that if we as parents generally throughout the Church will 
give the attention needed to correct any wrong impressions on the part 
of our children, whether they be young or mature, we should be able to 
help them to form correct conclusions and establish themselves in ability 
to resist these temptations that will come to them in life. If we will take 
the time to sit down with them and reason and discuss with them, not 
with any too great formality, but in kindness and consideration, I am 
sure it will be helpful to them in overcoming these things that they are 
bound to meet with in every walk of life in all their contacts and ex- 
periences. 

CHURCH RELIEF WORK FOLLOWING EARTHQUAKE 

I would like to call your attention to two or three items that are of 
rather great interest to me and I believe they are to you. One of them 
is with regard to the earthquake that recently occurred in California. 
I would like to read to you a portion of a letter received from a coun- 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 



63 



selor in the Bishopric of Long Beach Ward, which was the center of 
the earthquake and where the greatest damage was done : 

"Immediately after the first shock, which was the only one which caused any 
loss of life, except another this morning which, I am advised, caused the death 
of two elderly people who were caught in an apartment, we, together with the 
Relief Society, began to make a canvass, and up to noon Saturday had only found 
two of our people injured and none dead. One brother was cut on his arm and 
one sister with several broken ribs. However, they are getting along fine. 

"Yesterday we had Radio Station KFOX broadcast messages instructing all 
of our eighty-four Ward teachers in 42 districts to immediately cover their 
respective districts ; many had done so up to late last night and so far no additional 
reports of sick or injured other than our ordinary calls from week to week. 
Relief Society President Julia Hawkins this morning advises all calls to them have 
been taken care of. 

"The church building seems to be but slightly damaged. Several broken 
windows, some plaster off in the main auditorium and walls slightly cracked 
and chipped, but seems to be resting well on foundation and not out of line. 
We are arranging to have the city engineer make inspection today, and of course 
cannot advise definitely until after that. 

"Many of the other churches in down-town districts are totally destroyed, 
and a majority of the others have been moved at least a foot off their foundation 
and will have to be torn down." 

Here is a letter along the same line from President LeGrand 
Richards : 

"We are very pleased to advise that none of our people was injured and 
that no property damage has occurred to either our Church buildings or personal 
property of our members so far as we have been able to ascertain. 

"The Bishop of Alhambra Ward advises that the two inspectors who were 
sent to inspect their building reported it to be the best constructed brick building 
in Alhambra. We were in the Hollywood Stake tabernacle when it rocked back 
and forth like a drunken man but there were no cracks or other damage resulting 
therefrom." 

DIVINITY OF CHURCH ORGANIZATION 

One of the remarkable things about these reports is that such an 
organization obtains in the Church whereby the bishopric of a ward, 
the members of which were scattered throughout a large population, 
were able to get their ward teachers and their Relief Society teachers to 
do work immediately in checking up on the members of the ward to see 
that none was suffering from physical injuries or from other troubles 
or difficulties. That to me is a very remarkable testimony of the thor- 
oughness and effectiveness of the Church organization, and the fine 
results that are obtainable through the whole-hearted voluntary coopera- 
tion of all those who carry responsibility in the Church. 

INCREASE IN CHURCH ACTIVITY AND GROWTH 

In addition to the figures given yesterday morning relative to the 
progress of the Church, I would like to call your attention to some other 
things. There has been an increase in general activity in the wards and 
stakes during the past year as compared with, the previous year. There 
is quite a marked increase in the amount of ward teaching done generally 
throughout all the various wards of the Church. There has been an 



64 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



increase in the attendance at sacrament meetings as compared with 193 1 . 
There has been an increase in attendance at the weekly priesthood meet- 
ings. These are important items. 

The Lord has declared by revelation the sacrament meetings to 
be of great importance for the teaching and training of the members of 
the Church in faith and righteousness. The ward teaching is the most 
effective and potent means of coming in contact with all the members 
of the Church month by month, of teaching them to live in peace and 
harmony, to live the Gospel and to be united as families and to overcome 
weaknesses and shortcomings. 

We have had letters come to our office recently from a number of 
places, among them from ministers asking about our ward teaching sys- 
tem. They have understood that we were having very great success. It 
was a new idea to them and they have requested us to give them informa- 
tion upon which our system is based and how it is being carried out. 

CHURCH AND PRIESTHOOD GROWTH 

Of the total number of converts baptized last year, amounting to 
7825, as shown in the report presented by President Grant in the opening 
session of Conference, there was for the first time, I think, a larger 
number of converts baptized in the various stakes and wards than in the 
missions. Baptisms of converts in the stakes and wards amounted to 
4009 and in the missions to 3816. Another item of interest, I think, is 
the number of those who have received the priesthood as compared with 
the previous year. The total increase in the Melchizedek and Aaronic 
priesthood throughout the Church was 7433, of which there were 2875 
members of the Melchizedek priesthood and 4558 members of the Aaronic 
priesthood. The total membership in the priesthood, that is, the Mel- 
chizedek and Aaronic priesthood, at the end of last year, was 171,474. 
a tremendous army of picked men to battle for righteousness in the 
Church and in the world for the presentation of the Gospel message to 
mankind, and the promotion of faith and good works among the members. 

PRIESTHOOD SIGNIFIES ACTIVITY 

I am sure we realize the fact that with the ordination of these young 
men — I am speaking particularly of the Aaronic priesthood — it is ex- 
pected that every one who shall be ordained and every one who has been 
ordained shall be given specific duties to perform week by week; that 
they shall not only be appointed to perform duties pertaining to their 
calling and labors in the priesthood but that these appointments shall 
be followed up and these young men be brought to realize the fact that 
the giving of responsibility requires the fulfilment of that responsibility. 
It is the finest means of preparation and training for future accounta- 
bility. It trains them to magnify their callings, to be willing to fill their 
appointments and to carry out those things that are expected of them. 

FULFILMENT OF RESPONSIBILITY 

The statement is made by Owen D. Young, one of the great in- 
dustrialists of the country, that there is too much lack of leadership 



ELDER SYLVESTER Q. CANNON 



65 



among" American business men and unwillingness to take leadership. 
He states the reason is they are not ready to accept and fill the responsi- 
bilities that follow and are a part of leadership. I think that one of the 
vital means we have in the Church to produce the finest development in 
young men is through effective training of all members of the priesthood 
to accept responsibility and fulfil it, not only in the Church, but in the 
field of life and the various occupations and civic responsibilities that may 
come to them. 

EXPENDITURE OF TITHES 

I think you will realize from the statement made of the expenditure 
of the tithes that the tithes are used entirely for the various purposes 
which were enumerated yesterday, and that great care is being given by 
those who have the responsibility of the same — the First Presidency and 
those who are associated with them — in expending these means as care- 
fully and efficiently as possible, to the end that they may be most effect- 
ively distributed. The tithes that are donated by the members of this 
Church are serving to advance God's purposes in being used for the 
widest benefit of the Church members as a whole, and, through mis- 
sionary work, for the benefit of the world. 

The Church is doing a remarkable work in the preaching of the 
Gospel. The members of the Church are giving of their time and their 
means extensively without stint for the promotion of the Gospel message 
among mankind at large. They are engaged in doing work for those who 
have passed away, through the vicarious service that is being done in the 
temples. Altogether there is great evidence of unselfishness on the part 
of Latter-day Saints in what they are doing in a financial way, as well 
as through their direct efforts for the promotion of the welfare of 
mankind at large. 

TITHING AND TITHEPAYERS 

Due to the adverse financial conditions, there has been a decrease of 
tithes paid last year as compared with 1931. There has also been a 
decrease in the number of tithepayers. This is not so easy to explain: 
While it is true that many have been out of employment, it would appear 
that those who were not working and those who suffered losses during 
the year, could at least have donated to some extent, no matter how small, 
to be properly recorded. However, it is remarkable how splendidly the 
Latter-day Saints have demonstrated their faith and devotion to this and 
other divine principles. And such faith produces blessings. I would 
like to read to you briefly a statement made by President Hyrum Jensen 
of the Norwegian Mission that conforms in general to the statements 
made heretofore by other mission presidents. In this letter, in telling 
of the very unfavorable economic conditions in Norway, he states : "I 
feel that the Saints are trying to do their duty in the matter of tithing, 
but we are feeling the depression more and more as the days go by. It 
is reported from the different branches of the mission that no full tithe- 
payers have lost their jobs." It is a rather interesting thing to me that , 
in the midst of distress which exists in that land he can make such a 



66 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



report regarding those who have been faithful in the performance of 
their duties in the observance of this important principle. 

EFFICIENCY IN CHURCH BUILDING CONSTRUCTION 

With regard to the manner of building construction in California: 
We expect henceforth, and it has been evident in the building construc- 
tion of Church edifices there in the past, to do those things that will 
promote protection of the buildings against earthquakes. In other words, 
to design and construct the buildings which shall be erected in the 
future in those localities so that they will be able to withstand earth- 
quake shocks. As you realize, the great danger comes in earthquake 
sections from the damage to buildings and the falling of materials which 
causes injury and sometimes death to people. 

Further, the Church is doing everything possible in the building 
construction that is being undertaken, to exercise the greatest economy 
and care in the erection of these buildings, designing them to fit the needs 
of the people and yet not build extravagantly. The result has been that 
through the work being done largely by contract rather than day work, 
as had been done previously, avoiding extravagances in buildings, and 
through saving in costs of materials and labor, very material savings 
have been effected both to the members of the various wards concerned 
and to the Church at large. Altogether we find that within the last two 
years approximately forty percent has been saved in the costs as com- 
pared with previous outlay. The extent of the work done has, of course, 
been much less than it was previously. 

I rejoice, my brethren and sisters, in the progress of this work. 
I know and realize as you do that it is growing, and that there is a power 
within it that is not to be obtained in any other organization. I pray the 
Lord to bless and help every one of us to give ourselves wholeheartedly 
to the advancement of the work of God. I desire to dedicate myself to 
that end and to work with you and all the members of this Church in 
unity and faith and righteousness to build up this cause ; and I pray the 
Lord to bless us in our efforts, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

The congregation sang the hymn, "We thank Thee, O God, for a 
Prophet." 

Elder John A. Elison, President of the Raft River Stake, offered 
the closing prayer, after which the Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock. 



SECOND DAY 



AFTERNOON MEETING 

Conference continued in the Tabernacle at 2 o'clock. 

Music for this session was provided by the "Singing Mothers," 
Mrs. Charlotte O. Sackett, Director. They sang as an opening number 
the hymn, "Come, thou glorious day of promise." 

Elder Joseph E. Cardon, President of the Cache Stake, offered the 
invocation. 

The "Singing Mothers" then sang the hymn, "O My Father." 

ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

I trust that the few moments I occupy this afternoon I may have 
an interest in your faith and prayers, that the Lord will bless me to say 
the things he would have you hear. I have nothing particular on my 
mind, that I would like to speak about, other than to call attention, if 
I may, to the marvelous blessings that our Heavenly Father has bestowed 
upon the children of men in the day and age in which we live. 

THE INFLUENCE OF THE ADVERSARY 

This earth was prepared for us, created for the habitation of the 
children of men, and from the time that our first parents were placed 
upon it, down to the present, the Creator of heaven and earth, our 
Heavenly Father, has continued to entreat his sons and daughters to so 
live that they might be worthy to dwell with him eternally. But when 
we scan the history of mankind we realize that the other influence that 
is potent in the earth, that of the adversary of all righteousness, has been 
able to deceive many of the children of our Heavenly Father, and has 
prevented them from obtaining the blessings that the Lord desired them 
to enjoy. 

EXPERIENCES RELATED IN THE OLD TESTAMENT 

We read in the Old Testament that in the days of Noah that prophet 
taught the people for a hundred and twenty years to be righteous, and 
they failed to take advantage of their opportunities. The result was 
that after they had been sufficiently warned they suffered the punishment 
that had been impending for refusing to obey the counsel of the Lord 
imparted by a prophet. 

Then we remember how later, when the children of Israel were 
led into the wilderness by Moses, although they were surrounded by 
the arms of love of our Heavenly Father, so to speak — he fed them 
manna from heaven ; the rock of Horeb was cleft in order that they 
might have living water; he gave unto them that sure witness of a 
cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night ; they were led by a prophet 



68 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



of the Lord — and yet there were large numbers of them, even under 
that influence, who absolutely refused to observe the teachings of our 
Heavenly Father, failed to take advantage of his wise counsels, and the 
result was they did not have the opportunity of even seeing the promised 
land. 

THE WORK OF THE SAVIOR 

Then we have the case of the Savior. He came and gave to the 
children of men the Gospel in its purity. He came to prepare the way 
for all mankind to be resurrected and exalted, not only those who were 
then living, but those who had died ; that they might be raised from the 
dead, and an opportunity be offered to them to find a place in the celestial 
kingdom. Read the history of Israel at the time of the Savior, and see 
how few there were, comparatively, that really understood, that were 
able to measure up and be prepared to receive the marvelous heritage 
that our Heavenly Father has promised. 

AS RELATED IN THE BOOK OF MORMON 

Then we have the experiences of Jared and his colony, and of 
Lehi and his descendants, who crossed the mighty ocean, and came to 
the western hemisphere, led by prophets. Many of them obeyed the 
wise counsels of the men the Lord raised up to lead them, but a greater 
number were led astray by Satan and forfeited their heritage. 

It seems that all the time, notwithstanding the Lord has been tender 
and thoughtful of his children, the adversary has had such an influence 
over them the majority of them have been turned aside from the choice 
place, from the opportunity of attaining the celestial kingdom, and they 
will find their places in the terrestrial kingdom or the telestial kingdom ; 
and nobody to blame but themselves. 

Is it not remarkable, when we think about it, that that has been 
the experience of the people during various periods of the world's 
history. I have only mentioned some of the notable instances, but since 
the peopling of the earth the adversary of righteousness has been able, 
by means of sophistry, by veiled suggestions and delusions, by appealing 
to the selfishness of men, to lead from the path of rectitude and right 
the majority of mankind. 

IN THIS DISPENSATION 

Remembering the record of the past let us consider the present. 
In our day our Heavenly Father has restored the Gospel again. The 
Prophet Joseph Smith gave his life, as did his brother Hyrum, to testify 
that the Lord had spoken ; and the Church was organized under his 
direction, and divine authority was conferred. From that time until 
now the prophets and servants of the Lord have been teaching the, 
people righteousness. And yet today we find history repeating itself, 
and there are many of our brothers and sisters who have their names 
upon the records of the Church who, unless they repent of their sins, 
will find themselves cut off, as the Lord has said, from the opportunity 
of enjoying the celestial kingdom when this earth becomes that kingdom. 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 



69 



In order that we may be properly taught the Lord set apart the 
Sabbath, on which day he has advised his people to attend divine service, 
to partake of the sacrament and receive instructions. We meet together 
in quarterly conference in all the stakes ; we meet together in general 
conference twice a year; and we unite our hearts, our voices and our 
faith to the end that we may have our spiritual strength renewed and 
that we may have joy in contemplating what the Lord has said to us. 
We are surrounded by the temptations of the world, so that if we are 
not on our guard we are influenced by them, and if we are not careful 
we may step aside from the pathway that the Lord has pointed out. If 
we do that, then we have no promise of exaltation. 

HOUSES MUST BE SET IN ORDER 

Every human being, not only those in the ranks but the leaders of 
ancient Israel and the leaders of modern-day Israel — even the Prophet 
Joseph Smith himself and his associates — were admonished by our 
Heavenly Father, and attention was called to the fact that it was neces- 
sary for them to set their houses in order ; they were warned that unless 
they did that, unless their families gave heed to the teachings of the 
Gospel, they would lose their opportunity. That brings it right close 
to home, does it not — right into our own day ? Let us read a portion of 
Section 93 of the Doctrine and Covenants : 

"Behold, here is the agency of man, and here is the condemnation of man; 
because that which was from the beginning is plainly manifest unto them, and they 
receive not the light. 

"And every man whose spirit receiveth not the light is under condemnation. 

"For man is spirit. The elements are eternal, and spirit and element, in- 
separably connected, receive a fulness of joy; 

"And when separated, man cannot receive a fulness of joy. 

"The elements are the tabernacle of God ; yea, man is the tabernacle of God, 
even temples ; and whatsoever temple is defiled, God shall destroy that temple. 
"The glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth. 
"Light and truth forsake that evil one. 

"Every spirit of man was innocent in the beginning ; and God having redeemed 
man from the fall, men became again, in their infant state, innocent before God. 

"And that wicked one cometh and taketh away light and truth, through dis- 
obedience, from the children of men, and because of the tradition of their fathers. 

"But I have commanded you to bring up your children in light and truth. 

"But verily I say unto you, my servant Frederick G. Williams, you have con- 
tinued under this condemnation; 

"You have not taught your children light and truth, according to the command- 
ments ; and that wicked one hath power, as yet, over you, and this is the cause 
of your affliction. 

"And now a commandment I give unto you — if you will be delivered you shall 
set in order your own house, for there are many things that are not right in your 
house. 

"Verily, I say unto my servant Sidney Rigdon, that in some things he hath not 
kept the commandments concerning his children; therefore, first set in order 
thy house. 

"Verily, I say unto my servant Joseph Smith, Tun., or in other words, I will call 
you friends, for you are my friends, and ye shall have an inheritance with me — 

"I called you servants for the world's sake, and ye are their servants for my 
sake — 



70 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



"And now, verily I say unto Joseph Smith, Jun. — You have not kept the 
commandments, and must needs stand rebuked before the Lord ; 

"Your family must needs repent and forsake some things, and give more earnest 
heed unto your sayings, or be removed out of their place. 

"What I say unto one I say unto all ; pray always lest that wicked one have 
power in you, and remove you out of your place." (Sec. 93:31-49.) 

Isn't it unfortunate that men who received marvelous manifestations 
from the Lord, who knew the truth, were not able to resist the tempta- 
tions of the adversary, and many of the blessings that they might have 
enjoyed were lost to them ? We today are subject to the same influences 
but we should profit by the experiences of the past. 

BECAUSE OF VANITY AND UNBELIEF 

In order to avoid misquoting I desire to read a portion of one of 
the sections of the Doctrine and Covenants, in which the Lord, speaking 
to the Church in that early day, called attention to some things. He said 
this: 

"And the whole world lieth in sin, and groaneth under darkness and under 
the bondage of sin. * * * 

"And your minds in times past have been darkened because of unbelief, and 
because you have treated lightly the things you have received." (Sec. 84:49, 54.) 

Let me read that again, speaking to those early-day members of 
the Church : 

"And your minds in times past have been darkened because of unbelief, 
and because you have treated lightly the things you have received — " 

That explains why we do not always understand. That explains 
why we fall into transgression — because of unbelief and because we 
have treated lightly the things we have received. 

"Which vanity and unbelief have brought the whole church under condemna- 
tion. 

"And this condemnation resteth upon the children of Zion, even all." (Ibid. 
55-56.) 

NEGLECTING OUR OPPORTUNITIES 

When we think of the date of that revelation, September 22, 1832, 
how early it was, we realize that the Church had hardly been organized 
before the Lord began to call the attention of his children to the fact 
that they were losing their opportunities. 

And then he said further: 

"And as I said unto mine apostles, even so I say unto you, for you are mine 
apostles, even God's high priests; ye are they whom my Father hath given me; ye 
are my friends ; 

"Therefore, as I said unto mine apostles I say unto you again, that every soul 
who believeth on your words, and is baptized by water for the remission of sins, 
shall, receive the Holy Ghost. 

"And these signs shall follow them that believe," and so forth. (Ibid. 63-65.) 

I call attention to the fact that the Gospel was restored a little over 
a hundred years ago, and hundreds of thousands of people have par- 
ticipated in it. All this time the adversary has been seeking to thwart the 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH 



71 



purposes of the Lord and to take from the children of men the oppor- 
tunity that is theirs. 

Let us examine ourselves. We are living in a marvelous time. 
The conveniences and opportunities in the world were never so plentiful 
as today. Never such an opportunity to enjoy the comforts and blessings 
of our Heavenly Father as now. Yet the world has transgressed the 
laws of God. They have violated his commandments. I am speaking 
particularly now of the Ten Commandments. I will not take time to 
repeat them. You know what they are. But they are being ignored 
by a very large portion of our Father's children. They are being 
ignored by some of those whose names are upon the records of this 
Church, and the result will be that the opportunity to find, a place in the 
celestial kingdom will be taken from them, unless they repent of their 
sins and turn unto our Heavenly Father. Righteousness has never been 
popular with the masses. The popular thing is often the wrong thing. 
That a thing is popular is frequently justification for the Latter-day 
Saints to avoid it. 

GOD WILL NOT BE MOCKED 

We are living in a period of time when upheavals in the world are 
daily, almost momentary. Marvelous things are occurring. The map 
of the world is changing. The order of government is being modified. 
In our own nation we are almost helpless before the problems that con- 
front us, notwithstanding we are probably the wealthiest and most pow- 
erful nation in all the world. What is our difficulty, brethren and sisters ? 
It is that men refuse to hear what the Lord has said. They refuse to 
pay attention to his wise counsel. They absolutely neglect to give 
credence to the things that he teaches us, and he will not be mocked. 
He gives us the advice and the counsel that we need, but he will not 
compel us. But if we refuse we lose our opportunity, and it passes away 
from us, in many cases to return again no more forever. 

PARENTS MUST SAFEGUARD THEIR CHILDREN 

This is a marvelous organization with which we are identified, 
these great groups — the organizations of the priesthood and the auxil- 
iary groups in the stakes and wards and mission fields — in which there are 
faithful servants of the Lord, both men and women, seeking to improve 
the condition of the world ; and I realize how they are resisted many 
times by those who ought to hold up their hands, and objection is made 
to the teachings that are given because they are not popular, notwith- 
standing they are the Lord's teachings. 

We may just as well confront the fact that unless we, as parents in 
Zion, safeguard our children by teaching them, and by surrounding them 
by the arms of our love, unless we safeguard them by every possible 
means, the adversary will break down the barriers that are raised by the 
organizations that protect them, and those that we love more than we 
love our own lives will be drawn away from the truth; they will lose 
their faith; they will fall into transgression; and then we, the parents 
in Zion, will have occasion for sorrow, not only now but throughout 
the ages of eternity. 



72 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Brethren and sisters, these are perilous times. These are the days 
that the Lord has spoken of. I turn again to the first section of the 
Doctrine and Covenants and read from a revelation given in 1831 : 

"For I am no respecter of persons, and will that all men shall know that the 
day speedily cometh ; the hour is not yet, but is nigh at hand, when peace shall be 
taken from the earth, and the devil shall have power over his own dominion." 

We have been warned, brethren and sisters, not once but many 
times. There will be no excuse for us if we fail to do our part. As one 
of those whom the Lord has asked to teach, I plead with you to set your 
houses in order. Don't take too many things for granted. Don't be led 
into the follies and foibles of the world. Safeguard your families in 
every possible way. Unite them under the influence of prayer. I 
thought this morning when one of the speakers said : "Did you pray last 
night? Did you pray this morning?" what a power prayer is to keep 
us in the pathway to eternal life and lead us into the celestial kingdom ! 

OUR RESPONSIBILITY 

Nobody else can perform the part that God has assigned to us as 
parents. We have assumed an obligation when we have been the means 
of bringing children into the world. We can't place that responsibility 
upon any organization. It is ours. We can gain their assistance, and it 
is marvelous the assistance that is rendered by these great groups in the 
Church ; but first and foremost the obligation is upon you and upon me 
to not only advise and counsel but to train, by setting an example, by 
spending sufficient time with our loved ones, these boys and girls, that 
they may not be led into by and forbidden paths. 

VICE AND EVIL MUST BE RESTRAINED 

Only a few days ago a man, a member of the Church, who was in 
my office, said : 

"As I sat in my own home a few evenings ago I was horrified to hear the things 
that my own children and those who were visiting in my home were saying." He 
said : "One of the young ladies, only a girl, said to the others : 'I am going to 
learn how to drink this new beer, when it conies in. They say it isn't just the same 
as the near beer that we have been having ; it doesn't taste the same. 1 am going to 
learn to drink it, because it will be popular. Everybody will want to know how 
to do that.' " 

What does that mean? It means that if we let down the least bit 
in the effort that we have put forth to hold up the standard that God has 
created for us, we are responsible to him. I want to say that every voter 
in this Church, every legislator in this Church, every civil officer in this 
Church, is not only bound by the laws of the land in which we live, to 
sustain constitutional law, but we are bound by the moral law and by 
the advice and counsel that our Heavenly Father has given, to do every- 
thing possible to restrain vice and evil in the communities in which we 
live. If we fail to do that we can blame nobody but ourselves for the 
evil results. 



ELDER GEORGE ALBERT SMITH

HOLDING ALOFT THE BANNER OF RIGHTEOUSNESS 

I pray that during the continuation of this great conference we 
may have joy and satisfaction in the things that are said, as we have 
had in the meetings that have passed. I pray that we may go hence, 
when the work of the conference has finished, feeling renewed in our 
power to serve God ; that we may go to our abiding places determined 
to be worthy to be called sons and daughters of the living God ; that we 
may not say, because a thing is popular, that we will cast our lot with 
this group or that. But standing upon holy ground, because of the 
righteousness of our lives, may we hold aloft the banner that the Lord 
has given us to hold, bidding all men join us in the works of righteous- 
ness, preparing this earth to be the celestial kingdom, preparing those 
who dwell upon it even now to be worthy to be members of it; that 
when the time comes for us to go hence, those with whom we associate 
may be truly able to say that because of the righteousness of our lives 
we have influenced them to be better men and better women. 

ONE IN ALL THINGS 

I know that God lives. I know that Jesus is the Christ. I know 
that Joseph Smith was a prophet of the living God. I know that this is 
his Church, led by his chosen servants, and his divine authority is de- 
posited with it. I know it as I know that I live. With that knowledge 
in my soul I pray that weak and frail though I am I may continue 
to keep the faith, that I may continue to be worthy of your confidence, 
that we may live together in the bonds of love and unity and faith and 
devotion, keeping in mind this statement that has come to us from on 
high: ''Unless ye are one ye are not mine." 

Let us be one in all good things, helping and sustaining that which 
is righteous, encouraging that which will make for better citizens of the 
kingdom of heaven, as well as citizens of the land in which we live, 
that when the light shall go out of our eyes and we finish our work we 
may look back upon lives that have been consecrated to the blessing 
of mankind, and receive at the hands of the Master of heaven and earth 
that glorious welcome home : 

Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful in a few 
things. I will make you ruler over many things. Enter into the joy of your 
Lord. 

I humbly pray for this for all, in the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord, 
Amen. 

PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAWSON 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

My brethren and sisters : The thought of facing this great audience 
here, and the further thought of facing that greater audience who are 
on the air, is almost sufficient to sweep one off of his feet. From where 
you are sitting it looks like a very simple matter, but from where I am 



74 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



standing it appears quite difficult, and I must needs rely upon the Lord 
for his assistance in these important moments. 

I have no prepared discourse this afternoon. It is true that I have 
had some reflections pass through my mind, and I am trusting the Lord 
to help me give expression to them. 

EXPERIENCES DURING THE EARTHQUAKE IN LOS ANGELES 

I will say here, before I proceed further, a word in relation to the 
great earthquake at Los Angeles, in California. I was talking with a 
good brother yesterday, who said to me that he with three of his children 
was on the street at the time, and they were about to enter a store in 
order to make some purchases. But the Spirit of the Lord whispered 
to him and said : "Do not go in there. Go home." This good brother, 
perhaps not being entirely certain that it was the Spirit of the Lord, 
made another effort to enter the building, and turned his car toward the 
sidewalk curb. Some unusual power straightened his car out parallel 
with the street and said: "Do not go in there. Go home." lie gave 
heed to this voice of warning, .and started for his home, lie hadn't 
gone far before the earthquake came, and some twenty-three people 
lost their lives in the vicinity of that spot where he endeavored to enter 
the store. Due to this warning his life and the lives of his children 
were saved. He also said to me that the Latter-day Saint woman who 
lost her life had a similar warning, but she failed somehow to give heed 
to it. 

THE EVERLASTING, UNCHANGEABLE GOSPEL 

The brethren who speak from this stand very often cross one an- 
other's tracks. This is not to be wondered at when we remember that 
we have been preaching the everlasting, unchangeable (iospel for one 
hundred years. If we shall go on for another hundred years — and if 
we do not go on for another hundred years and more, our children and 
grandchildren and great-grandchildren will go on — they will still be 
preaching the everlasting, unchangeable Gospel. Nevertheless, there is 
sufficient variety in the preaching of the Gospel, from a personal stand- 
point, such as the angle at which the Gospel is approached, the manner 
of speaking, and other influences and qualifications, to make these 
sermons interesting and instructive, if only they are prompted by the 
Spirit of the Lord. That is the important thing. 

THE SEEN AND UNSEEN WORLDS 

I am led to make this remark, that things on earth are typical of 
things in heaven. As Latter-day Saints, and the world at large also, we 
are deeply interested in and connected with both of two worlds, one 
seen and the other unseen. The unseen world is much larger and greater 
and much more important than the world that is seen, the world in 
which we live. The world in which we live is greatly magnified by the 
fact that we can behold it with our mortal eyes. The unseen world 
suffers in that respect, because we do not see it with the mortal eye. 
Somebody may ask : "Can it be seen ?" Yes, oh yes, indeed, it can be 



PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAW SON 



75 



seen. "But how shall we see it?" We must look at it through our spirit- 
ual eye, or in other words, the eye of faith. There is no doubt but what 
it exists, that greater world, and that it is very substantial. The Prophet 
Joseph Smith has said this concerning it : "There is no such thing as 
immaterial matter, for all spirit is matter but it is more fine and pure, and 
can only be discerned by purer eyes. We cannot see it, but when our 
bodies are purified we shall see that it is all matter." 

Now, this spiritual world is thought to be, by some people, some- 
thing very intangible, because they do not see it with the mortal eye, and 
cannot feel it or handle it. But as I have already stated, it is very 
substantial in its character. It is to that unseen world that we go when 
we pass from this life. Now, the thing I wish to say is this : When our 
loved ones sicken and die they are carefully laid away in their graves. 
We mourn for those who die, and we say of them that they have gone 
to their rest in the paradise of God, there to await the resurrection of 
the just, and that they will come forth, in the first resurrection. All that 
is very true. 

ACTIVITY IN THE SPIRIT WORLD 

But what does this rest consist of ? I rather think it means that they 
will rest from their worldly anxieties, from pain suffered in this life, 
from sickness and disease. All those things will pass away. Freed 
from the anxieties and troubles of mortality I apprehend that they will 
be very active. I know some people who have claimed that they saw 
Joseph Smith, the Prophet, in vision or in dreams, but in all such in- 
stances he appeared to be exceedingly busy, busier than ever he was in 
life, in order, apparently, that he might accomplish some important work 
he had in hand. He seemed to be in a great hurry. I think very likely 
that is the case with others who die. Whatever activity there is with us 
in this life,' it is due to the spirit, or life, within us — not to the body. 
It is the spirit that gives action, and the spirit, when it leaves the body, 
undoubtedly is very much alive. 

Another thing I wish to emphasize for a few moments, because it 
points to the thing I would like to lay before you is this : Sometimes 
people ask the question (speaking of the activity referred to, of the 
spirit, when it goes. into the spirit world), "How is that directed? What 
does that activity consist of ? What do the dead do ?" That is a query 
that often comes into the mind. It comes into my mind, and no doubt 
into yours. We wonder what our loved ones are doing over there on the 
other side. If I should make answer I would say that in my opinion they 
are doing over there just exactly what we are doing here. Somebody 
says : "Well, how can you explain that thought, Brother Clawson ?" I 
explain it upon this basis : In heaven there is the Church of the First- 
born. It has been referred to already in this conference. You will 
find it in the scriptures. It is referred to in Paul's epistle to Hebrews, 
and is called the Church of the First-born. The First-born in heaven 
is Jesus Christ; consequently the Church of the First-born in heaven 
is the Church of Jesus Christ. 



76 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



THE CHURCH HERE AND THE CHURCH IN HEAVEN 

And then we have the Church of Jesus Christ upon the earth, and 
I should say that as between these, two churches there is virtually no 
difference, except this, that in the one case the church is upon the earth, 
and in the other case the church is in the spirit world, or in heaven. The 
work that we are expected to do here, I am sure we will be expected to 
do over there, and we will have the means to do it. They who have gone 
before us, who bear the priesthood, have taken the means with them 
which represents divine authority. We lose nothing by dying, except 
the body which must go back to the earth that gave it. The body belongs 
to the earth. It is formed of dust, and will return to dust. But the 
spirit came from God, and when it leaves the body it will return to God 
who gave it. That is good scripture. 

Now, a man who is an apostle here will be an apostle there. A man 
who is a high priest here, or a seventy, or an elder, or a patriarch, when 
he dies, will still be in possession of the office he held on earth. The high 
priest, for instance, will pass into the high priests' quorum there, the 
seventy into the seventies' quorum, and the elder into the elders' quorum, 
and so on. It is all one church. All that divides these two great church 
divisions is the veil, and the principles of the Gospel that govern here 
in the Church of Christ will surely govern there in the Church of Christ. 
So the men holding various offices in the priesthood in this life will pass 
into their proper quorums in the life to come. No doubt it will all be 
done in perfect order. There will be no confusion, and the good work 
will go on. 

THE WORK FOR OUR ANCESTORS 

Somebody asks : "How will it go on ?" The answer is : There are 
many, very many spirits there, men and women who have lived upon 
the earth, who came into their bodies, laid down their bodies again, and 
went into the spirit world, who never heard the Gospel. We often allude 
to them as our ancestors. There isn't a man in this congregation but 
who has a line of ancestors, and there isn't a woman in this congregation 
but who has her line of ancestors, and we can't get away from them. A 
man can't get away from his father or his mother. We all know that to 
be true. They have a claim upon us as our parents and we have a claim 
upon them as their children. This is also true of our ancestors. 

Now, there are many of our ancestors who had no opportunity at all 
in life of hearing the Gospel. That opportunity must come to them. 
How can it come to them ? Only in one way, and that is by the preaching 
of the Gospel, and the Gospel will be preached to them, I am sure, by 
the apostles and prophets, high priests, seventies and elders who have 
lived and died and gone into the spirit world. The work to be done 
there is vastly greater than that which is done upon the earth by the 
Saints of God. There are millions and millions upon millions who have 
lived and died since the Savior was upon the earth, down to the present 
time. The work must be done for them. That obligation, brethren 
and sisters, is resting upon the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints. They are looking to us for it. 



PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAW SON 



77 



"For this cause was the Gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they 
might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the 
spirit." 

Yes, live by the principles of God in the spirit, and be judged by 
the ordinances of the Gospel performed for them in the flesh. How 
beautiful that is ! 

The Savior stands for us. He has given his life's blood, that precious 
blood, that we might be saved. So we must stand for our ancestors. 
We must do for them the work that they cannot do for themselves. I 
call your attention to this fact, that that particular work is perhaps the 
most benevolent, the most charitable work in all the world, because they 
find themselves in a position where they cannot move. Their progress 
is stopped. The Savior said — you will remember the language, it is 
very clear, very emphatic — 

"Except a man" — and a man means every man, all men — "Except a man be 
born of water and of the spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God." 

That edict reaches into eternity. It is not surprising at all that 
when Elijah came and turned the key, the fathers behind the veil would 
be interested in their children on this side of the veil, and those fathers 
are looking to us to do the work for them, and we are under obligation 
to do the work. 

CHRIST IN THE SPIRIT WORLD 

You will remember, brethren and sisters, the injunction of the 
Savior, when he advised his followers to lay up treasures in heaven. 
What greater treasures can you lay up in heaven than by bringing sal- 
vation through the Gospel to some of those immortal souls of God, his 
children. It is said of Christ: 

"He hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring 
us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the spirit : 

"By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison ; 

"Which sometime were disobedient, when once the long-suffering of God 
waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, 
eight souls, were saved by water." 

So it seems that Christ was not idle while his body rested in the grave 
for three days, prior to his resurrection. He was preaching the Gospel. 
He preached it here. He preached it there. Is not that an example to us ? 
We preach the Gospel here. Think you not that we will also be called 
upon to preach the Gospel there? I rather like the thought. It is 
beautiful. Christ sets the example in more ways than one. He gave 
us the law of the Gospel. He gave us the law of baptism, and he em- 
phasized and magnified the law, by submitting to it himself. He said : 
"Follow me." In following him he expects us, of course, to do the works 
that he did. 

THE TEMPLE, THE CONNECTING LINK 

And so we have two great churches, one in heaven, the other upon 
the earth. They are moving along parallel lines, and the temple of God, 
it appears to me, is the connecting link that connects the heavens with 



78 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



the earth, because it is through the temple that we will be able to reach 
our dead, and not otherwise. To pray for the dead may not be of any 
real assistance to them. To actually help them we must do a work for 
them. 

The following piece of information, I am sure, will be very inter- 
esting to you, and will also be instructive. Something over six millions 
of endowments have been administered in the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints up to December, 1932. Something over eight 
millions of baptisms for the dead have been solemnized in the Church of 
Jesus- Christ of Latter-day Saints up to December 31st; 1932. Many 
thousands of sealings of wives to husbands, and of children to parents, 
have taken place. 

I think we may reasonably expect that the great majority of these 
who have had the work done for them will accept it, and if that be the 
case, brethren and sisters, you will see at a glance that the Church of 
the First-born in heaven is much greater and stronger, and the member- 
ship there is much more numerous than it is in the Church of Jesus Christ, 
or the First-bom, here upon the earth. 

When I saw these figures I was very much impressed with them. 

THE LAST SERMON OF PRESIDENT WOODRUFF 

Perhaps I will just have time, possibly, to allude to the last sermon 
of President Wilford Woodruff. It was delivered in this Tabernacle, 
April 10, 1898. He bore a very powerful and impressive testimony. He 
said : 

"At the close of this conference I have a desire to bear my testimony before 
you upon a few principles. I have rejoiced very much during this conference 
in listening to the testimonies of the apostles and elders who have spoken. It has 
brought to my remembrance a little of my history. 

"In April of 1838, while in the town of Kirtland, in walking across the street, 
I met two men who held the apostleship. They said to me : 'Brother Woodruff, 
we have something that we want you to join us in.' Said I, 'What is it?' 'We 
want another prophet to lead us.' 'Whom do you want?' 'We want Oliver 
Cowdery. Joseph Smith has apostatized.' After listening to them, I said : 'Unless 
you repent of your sins, you will be damned and go to hell, and you will go through 
the fulness of eternal damnation, and all your hopes in this life will pass before 
you like the frost before the rising sun. You are false. Joseph Smith holds 
the keys of the kingdom of God on earth, and will hold them until the coming 
of the Son of Man, whether in this world or in the world to come.' I am happy 
to say that these men did repent pretty soon, turned to the Church, and died in it. 

"I feel thankful today that Joseph F. Smith is with us as a son of Hyrum 
Smith. He bears a true and faithful testimony of his father. I would to God 
that Joseph Smith had a son in the flesh who would do as Joseph F. Smith does 
here — bear testimony to the truth of his father. The Prophet Joseph Smith has 
no son that stands in the midst of the Church of God and bears record of his 
father. He never has had, possibly never will have. 

"I will give you a testimony here that will show you where I stand with 
regard to this matter. Joseph Smith never ordained his son Joseph, never blessed 
him, never set him apart to lead this Church and kingdom on the face of the earth. 
When he or any other man says he did, they state that which is false before high 
heaven. 

"The last speech that Joseph Smith ever made to the quorum of the apostles 
was in a building in Nauvoo, and it was such a speech as I never heard from 



PRESIDENT RUDGER CLAW SON 



79 



mortal man before or since. He was clothed upon with the spirit and power of 
God. His face was clear as amber; the room was filled as with consuming fire. 
He stood three hours upon his feet. Said he : 'You Apostles of the Lamb of 
God have been chosen to carry out the purposes of the Lord on the earth. Now. 
I have received, as the Prophet, Seer and Revelator, standing at the head of 
this dispensation, every key, every ordinance, every principle and every priesthood 
that belongs to the last dispensation and fulness of times. And I have sealed 
all these things upon your heads. Now, you Apostles, if you do not rise up and 
bear off this kingdom, as I have given it to you, you will be damned.' 

"I am the only witness left on earth that can bear record of this, and [ am 
thankful that I have lived to see the day in which I stand. I am thankful to see 
the sons of these prophets and apostles holding the Holy Priesthood in our day 
and generation. I do not believe the day will ever come — it is too late in the day, 
in my opinion — when any elder in this Church will be called to stand before any 
two of the apostles with us today and give unto them the declaration that I gave 
unto the two apostles I have referred to. I do not think any of the apostles will 
occupy that position. I have faith to believe that these men will bear the apostle- 
ship, will hold it, and live their religion. They have been called and ordained of 
God for this purpose. I do not think that one of them will apostatize. I believe 
that they will be with you and with this Church while they stand in the flesh, true 
and faithful to God." 

There is another clause here which I wish to read. It has some 
bearing on what I have said. 

"Brother Cannon" — meaning George Q. Cannon — "has been laying before you 
something with regard to the nation in which we live, and what has been said 
concerning it. I am going to bear my testimony to this assembly, if I never do it 
again in my life, that the men who laid the foundation of this American govern- 
ment, and signed the Declaration of Independence, were the best spirits the God 
of Heaven could find on the face of the earth. They were choice spirits, not 
wicked men. General Washington and all the men that labored for that purpose 
were inspired of the Lord. Another thing I am going to say here, because I have 
a right to say it, every one of those men that signed the Declaration of Inde- 
pendence, with General Washington, called upon me, as an apostle of the Lord 
Jesus Christ, in the temple at St. George, two consecutive nights, and demanded 
at my hands that I should go forth and attend to the ordinances of the House of 
God for them. Men are here, I believe, that know of this, Brother J. D. T. 
McAllister, David H. Cannon and James S. Bleak. Brother McAllister baptized 
me for all those men, and then I told these brethren that it was their duty to go 
into the temple and labor until they had got endowments for all of them. They 
did it. Would those spirits have called upon me as an elder of Israel, to perform 
that work, if they had not been noble spirits before God? They would not. I bear 
this testimony because it is true. The Spirit of God bore record to myself and the 
brethren while we were laboring in that way. 

"What has been said with regard to this nation and to our position is coming" 
to pass, and all the powers of earth and hell will not stay the hand of Almighty 
God in the fulfilment of the great prophecies that have 'come to pass to prepare 
the way for the coming of the Son of Man. 

".You who have gathered here are my witnesses of this. I feel as though the 
day has come when every elder and every Latter-day Saint ought to stop and 
consider the position he is in, and the covenants he has entered into. Is there any- 
thing on the face of the earth that will pay you to depart from the oracles of 
God and from the Gospel of Christ ? Is there anything that will pay you to lose 
the principles of salvation, to lose a part in the first resurrection, with the priv- 
ilege of standing in the morning of the resurrection clothed with glory, immor- 
tality and eternal life, at the head of your father's house? No, there is nothing. 
I feel sorry many times when I see men who have the priesthood almost forget 
that they have any interest in the work of God. 

"I feel thankful to God that I have lived as long as I have, and to see as 
much as I have in fulfilment of the words of the Prophet of God. His days 



80 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



were few. The lives of great men have been strange. The idea of Jesus Christ, 
the Son of the living God, only laboring three years and a half in the ministry, 
then he was put to death. His apostles too were put to death, excepting John the 
Revelator, and they would have killed him if they could have done so. He lived 
because God wanted him to live. 

"We live in the last dispensation, and in the midst of the great work that all 
the patriarchs and prophets since God made the world have spoken of. Afflictions 
and tribulations await the world. The destroying" angels have got their sharp 
sickles in their hands, and are going to reap down the earth. Everything that has 
been spoken by the prophets under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost will come 
to pass in the generation in which we live. Do not forget it. 

"I thank God we are as well as we are; that we have as many as we have who 
are united together in the Priesthood. Let us try to live our religion, do our duty_. 
and magnify our callings while we are here. The eyes of all heaven are over us. 
The eyes of the world are over us. The eyes of the angels are over us. The Lord 
has looked upon us and upon the house of Israel to be saviors of the nations. We 
are here to fulfill these principles. 

"I pray God my Heavenly Father that as elders of Israel and as Latter-day 
Saints we may prize these principles, and that we may do our duty what time we 
spend here in the flesh. These apostles and all the quorums of the Priesthood have 
a great work upon them, to redeem their dead. Do not neglect it. You will 
have sorrow if you do, and any man who neglects the redemption of his dead, 
who has power to officiate for them here will have sorrow. When you go to the 
other side of the veil, if you have entered into these temples and redeemed your 
progenitors by the ordinances of the House of God, you will hold the keys of their 
redemption from eternity to eternity. Do not neglect this !" 

God bless you brethren and sisters is my prayer in the name of 
Jesus Christ, Amen. 

Two young boys, Ronald and Royal Buttars, sang a duet, "What is 
a home without love?" after which the "Singing Mothers" sang the an- 
them, "I waited for the Lord." 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I am almost sorry that we did not decide to hold this conference 
four days. For some reason or other we do not seem to be able to get 
quite through in three days. I suppose we have too many speakers and 
too many ideas. We would like to hear from some of our Mission 
Presidents. I dislike very much to limit their time, but I suppose we 
will have to do so. We would like them to bear their testimonies and 
make a few remarks. 

ELDER ARTHUR WELLING 

President of the North Central States Mission 

My brethren and sisters, I am very proud and happy to be a mis- 
sionary of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which I 
believe to be the greatest agency ever known to man for character edu- 
cation and for spiritual, moral and physical development. 

I am happy to be here, to give brief report of the mission in which 
I have the honor to serve, and to bear my testimony to the truthfulness 
of this great latter-day work. 

In the North Central States Mission we have forty regular mis- 



ELDER ARTHUR WELLING 



81 



sionaries, all well and busy and happy in their work, and the Lord 
is magnifying' them therein. Were there time I could tell you something 
good about every one of them. We have sixty special missionaries 
giving all the way from one or two hours a day to 1 nearly full time in 
missionary service, and the Lord is blessing their efforts. We have 
twenty-six hundred members, and though in our wheat-growing prairie 
states and provinces we feel the pinch of these hard times, our people 
are faithful and are to the best of their ability living the Gospel as they 
understand it. 

We have a great many friends, I am glad to say, and their number 
is increasing. Officers of the law; educators, and the traveling public 
particularly, have a growing friendliness for the Church and its people. 
We never meet a man or woman who has been here, and has visited this 
block, but has a kindly word for Utah and the people of the Church. 

Since the Word of Wisdom has been so forcefully emphasized at 
this conference, you may be interested to know that not many weeks 
ago an officer of the city of Minneapolis, the greatest city within our 
borders, having heard something about the Word of Wisdom, asked 
for more information concerning it, explaining that he was to appear 
before the men's club of his church. He was supplied liberally with 
charts and graphs and statistics, such as were assembled during the great 
Word of Wisdom exhibit a few years ago ; and he later reported having 
used them in his church with creditable effect. 

But, my brethren and sisters, while friends multiply, real converts 
to the divinity of this great Latter-day work are few. "We believe in 
God the eternal Father, and in his Son, Jesus Christ." So do many 
other good people ; but not in the same literal sense in which we do. 

Not many days ago, over in the city of Great Falls, where President 
Sloan's responsibilities leave off and mine begin, a sister told me of a 
conversation in which a friendly non-member of the Church complained : 
"You Mormon people seem to think and act as if you thought Jesus 
Christ himself might have come to the earth to organize your church." 
"Well," replied the good sister, "what would you say if I should tell you 
that is exactly what he did do ?" 

The difference is significant. Plenty of honest and honorable men 
affirm a faith correctly described, it seems to me, as "A form of Godli- 
ness without the power [or reality] thereof." Others declare with one 
of old, "Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, * * * 
and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe." Real faith in a 
living, personal Savior is all too rare. 

I have not felt the nail-prints in his hands and feet, but I believe 
as I believe that I live that he lives as truly and as really as when he 
walked in Galilee ; and I am comforted by his kindly assurance to the 
doubter of old : Blessed art thou Thomas, because thou hast believed 
having seen ; but blessed are they who believe not having seen — or words 
<-o that effect. 

We know that he lives for our prophets have seen him. He did 
come to earth and re-establish his church among men. The Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is in truth, his church. His priesthood 



82 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



is here, and under the ministration of authorized servants, it works to 
the benefit and blessing of mankind. May it continue to grow, and may 
the honest in heart of all the earth receive a testimony of its truth and 
be made partakers of its blessings, I humbly pray, in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Amen. 

ELDER WILLIAM R. SLOAN 

President of the Northwestern States Mission 

Several years ago we had 150 missionaries in the Northwestern 
States. Our numbers have been reduced until there are only 36 
today. Because of the great shortage, and I believe through the 
inspiration of George F. Richards, new light came when we were 
advised to draft into service local people in our mission. Acting 
upon this suggestion we now have 293 special missionaries. I wish 
I could tell you just one-tenth of the many testimonies we have 
received from these brethren and sisters through the blessings of 
the Lord. We have mothers with families of two, three, and four 
children, spending part of their time in this wonderful work along 
with their husbands. Many of them have reported to me that 
they have never known such happiness in their homes before. Not 
only spiritual but financial blessings attend them in their work. 

We have tried in our mission to take the counsel given by 
President Grant and President Ivins. We have made desperate 
efforts to rid ourselves of obligations, and I am sure that it has 
been pretty .well accomplished. Ninety-five per cent of all the 
contributions made in our mission have come from non-tithe payers, 
and the tithe-payers are self sustaining. We have counseled our 
people to provide supplies for their families, and in the homes of 
almost all our branch presidents and our leading men you will find 
provisions enough to last them almost another year. One of our 
branches has sufficient flour, wheat, sugar and groceries to last 
every member of the branch for one year from now. This spring, 
as part of them were living in the city and others on ranches, one 
of our brethren with a large ranch turned over to the people in the 
city sufficient ground for. them to raise all the garden truck they 
need, and already gardens are being planted which will provide 
every family with enough for the coming year. We feel that the 
Lord is blessing us. Our organizations have never been in a better 
or more healthy condition, our meeting houses and places of wor- 
ship are crowded to their capacity, inadequate in some instances 
to accommodate the people who attend our Sunday Schools and the 
Auxiliary work. We are happy for this. I could tell you so many 
things- about our activities in the mission but the time will not 
permit. 

I wonder if you know, here in Salt Lake, what was accom- 
plished by a kind deed one day years ago. A sister, not a member 
of our- Church, was stricken with a serious malady. Her doctor 
gave her no hopes and said she had only six months to live and 
that would be conditional that she would move somewhere into the 



ELDER WILLIAM R. SLOAN 



83 



mountains. He recommended Salt Lake City. She had never been 
among the "Mormons" in her life and came here with considerable 
misgivings^ and unacquainted with the people. She shipped her 
furniture here and rented a little home in the eastern part of the 
city. The drayman took the furniture out to the home one after- 
noon and she busied herself as best she could adjusting the little 
cottage as her future home. In the evening she heard a rap at the 
kitchen door and as she opened the door there stood a lady with a 
tray in her hand, covered with a nice white napkin. "I am your 
neighbor," she said in introducing herself; "I saw you move in this 
afternoon, I knew you would not be able to cook today and so I 
have prepared an evening meal and have brought you a nice warm 
dinner. Although we are strangers will you accept of our hospi- 
tality?" "Oh yes," she said, "And how thankful I am to you for 
this act of kindness." 

The next day they became a little better acquainted, and so as 
time went on their friendship grew. The children in the neighbor- 
hood made friends with her and were so kind and did many little 
acts of kindness for her. Her health was restored and a year or two 
later she returned to her home in the Northwest. 

One day she called me up from the hotel and asked for an 
audience with me. A few moments later she came to my office, 
where she related the above story. Among other things she said, 
"President Sloan, the peculiar thing of it all was that this woman 
was a 'Mormon' and her neighbor and her children were 'Mor- 
mons,' and because of their kindness to me I have always felt 
from then until now that I was obligated to your Church, and I feel 
that I must do something in. a monetary way to show my sincere 
gratitude to the 'Mormon' people who did so much for me." She 
handed me a check for one thousand dollars and asked that I accept 
it as a contribution, as a slight token of her appreciation. 

I am sure that the sister who furnished that meal never ex- 
pected any remuneration. I am sure she considered it a mere pass- 
ing incident, as any good mother would do. I am wondering if she 
is still alive and if she is hearing my voice today. It is far better 
to give than to receive. 

I would like to bear witness in behalf of our wonderful Choir 
and tell Brother Lund and his associates in this great work what 
they are doing for the Northwestern States Mission. The hearts 
of tens of thousands of people are gladdened by the strains of the 
glorious old organ and our wonderful Choir, famous the world over. 
You are doing a missionary work for us far greater, in many 
instances, than our missionaries can do. 

God bless you my brothers and sisters and these men who 
represent God. I pray that we may take their counsel. May we 
not only sing "We thank thee, O God for a Prophet," but let us 
take the word of God's holy prophets, his counsel, and reduce it to 
our every day practice in life, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. 
Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ELDER MILES L. JONES 

President of the East Central States Mission 

President C'lawson has just expressed the feelings that come to 
me in standing before you this afternoon. My experience has taught 
me this, brethren and sisters, that when we are called to take an active 
part in the work of the Lord he will always make us equal to the occa- 
sion, provided we put our hearts and souls into the work. 

I am very pleased to bring to you greetings from the missionaries 
laboring in the East Central States Mission. We have a splendid group 
of young men and young ladies laboring in that mission who are active 
in the service of the Lord. I am also pleased to meet with many of those 
who have returned from the mission, some of whom are here in the 
congregation this afternoon. 

We have the spirit of love and unity in our midst, both with the 
Saints and missionaries. I am very pleased to state that many are 
coming into the Church, and many others are interested in our teachings 
and have signified their intention of becoming one with us in the near 
future. Through the testimony and the teachings of these humble lady 
missionaries and Elders who are laboring in their midst many are giving 
serious consideration to their spiritual welfare and as to what the future 
holds for them. 

I was very pleased to hear the address given by President Grant 
yesterday morning, in regard to the observance of the Word of Wisdom. 
Just a short time ago, while holding conference in one of our branches 
or districts, a young man just blooming into manhood came up to me, 
and I noticed that his countenance was much brighter than usual ; his 
complexion was clear, his eyes sparkled, and he said to me : "President, 
I wanted to tell you that for the past six months I have observed the 
Word of Wisdom. I have quit the use of tobacco." 

I said to him: "My boy, I am glad to hear that. Now," I said, 
"how do you feel physically? Don't you feel much better?" 

"Yes, I do." 

Then I said, "Don't you feel much better spiritually? Don't you 
feel now as though you would like to receive the priesthood, and become 
active in the work?" 

"Yes, I feel that I would." 

Then I said : "There is another phase of this question," and I 
asked him how much tobacco he had been in the habit of using. 

"Oh," he said, "I wasn't a very heavy user. A package of cigarets 
lasted me a whole day." 

I said: "What did they cost you?" 

"Only fifteen cents." 

"Well," I said, "three hundred days at fifteen cents would be forty- 
five dollars, and sixty days at fifteen cents would be nine dollars — or a 
total of fifty-four dollars. The other five days at fifteen cents would be 
seventy-five cents. Making a total of $54.75 a year. Now," I said, 
"my boy, if someone would come to you at the end of the year and hand 
you $54.75, what could you do with that?" 



ELDER MILES L. JONES

He replied : "I have never figured it in that way." He then went 
on to enumerate what he could purchase with that amount of money. 

I wonder, my brethren and sisters, if there are many of us here at 
home who are spending money for candy and other things of that kind, 
that we could put to better use and especially during these trying times ? 

I am very pleased to state that the health of the Saints, with few 
exceptions, as well as that of the missionaries, is very good throughout 
the Mission. We are coming in contact with men and women of in- 
fluence and of standing in the communities. They are giving considera- 
tion to our teachings, and I can see a bright and a glorious prospect for 
the work of the Lord, in that part of the land. 

I rejoice in a testimony of the divinity of this work. I am thankful 
to the Lord that I have been called to labor in various capacities from 
time to time, both at home and abroad, because I have realized many 
blessings that come to those who serve the Lord. 

God bless you. May his peace ever abide with you, I humbly pray, 
in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

ELDER ALONZO A. HINCKLEY 

President of the California Mission 

I am delighted with the opportunity of at least bearing my testi- 
mony before this great audience. Since I addressed you last a great many 
things have happened. I do not wish, to speak of calamities. I wish 
to speak of blessings. 

I am exceedingly happy and my heart rejoices, for I realize that in 
the calling in which I am now engaged I am actually about my Father's 
business ; that I am a soul that has been called, by prophecy and by the 
laying on of hands, to preach the Gospel and administer in the ordinances 
thereof, the most blessed work, the most soul-satisfying work in the 
world. What a glorious privilege to move about, directed by the Spirit 
of God, feeling his presence, knowing that he goes before you, that he 
is upon your right hand and upon your left, preparing the way, that you 
might present for him the everlasting Gospel to the honest in heart ; to 
be placed in a position where you think no evil, where selfishness is done 
away, where pride is laid aside, where love holds sway, where unity is 
perfect. What a blessed condition to be in, surrounded with young- 
men and young women who constitute the missionary force, the very 
elect of the Lord, clean in mind and clean in body, true to the faith ; to 
feel their friendship, their supporting love and confidence, brings a joy 
unspeakable. 

They may have come into the mission field perhaps crude, perhaps 
with little experience, but they have worked, they have studied, they have 
prayed, they have practiced righteousness; and then they go forth, in 
the vigor of their young manhood and womanhood, to conquer, and 
their spirit is a contagious spirit. It is heavenly in its influence. I love 
them. The Saints love them, truly respect them. The purity of their 
lives is appealing, and they win their way into the confidence of all men 
and all women that are pure of heart.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



I say they are young. The Lord has used, the young. I think that 
Orson Pratt was only nineteen years of age when the Lord gave a special 
revelation, and said : 

"Blessed are you because you have believed ; 

"And more blessed are you because you are called of me to preach my Gospel ; 
"To lift up your voice as with the sound of a trump, both long and loud, and 

cry repentance unto a crooked and perverse generation, preparing the way of 
the Lord for his second coming." 

This is our great mission. This is the work we rejoice in. This 
is the work we are united in, and the Lord abides with us in performing 
this great mission under his command. 

The past year has been a glorious year for the Saints of the Califor- 
nia Mission. Our numbers have increased to a greater degree than they 
have increased in any of the recent years that have passed. The 
faithfulness of the Saints was never more manifest. Their unity was 
never more perfect. Their devotion to the cause fills them with joy 
and satisfaction. Could you enter into our branch meetings and listen 
to the testimonies of these faithful Saints, your heart would thrill be- 
cause of the spirit that is there present. 

I don't know that an earthquake is an activity that pertains to 
church duty, but at least it is an activity. I tell you, if you want to 
have a peculiar sensation an earthquake will give it to you ; you can make 
no appeal for help to any human source, you sense your dependence 
upon a higher power, you think instantly of the predicted calamities. 
My heart is a believing heart, thank God, for I have read his holy word ; 
I have read of the calamities and of the testimonies which are to follow 
the testimonies of the Elders, but I have never longed for the time to come 
when calamities should be the testimony. Oh, I felt to pray for a stay of 
the day, that the Lord should multiply the messengers of salvation, that 
he should intensify the results of their labors, that whenever the day 
must come when peace is taken from the earth, and when Satan shall 
rule amongst his own. the Lord shall rule gloriously among his Saints, 
and their number shall be multitudinous. Oh, may he spare the people 
and give us the opportunity to labor with them. 

It seems to me that there are thousands and millions of honest and 
true and undefiled. May we reach them, until they shall say in their 
hearts : "Men and brethren, what shall we do ?" And may those bearing 
the priesthood be able to answer, in the voice of God : "Repent and be 
baptized for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the Holy Ghost," 
and receiving it, may they walk in its light and be saved. 

That is my prayer, that is my labor, and I testify that it is glorious, 
that it is of God, that it is the true way of salvation in the name of Jesus 
Christ, Amen. 

ELDER JAMES H. MOYLE 

President of the Eastern States Mission 

I am pleased to report that the Eastern States Mission is in a good, 
healthy condition. At all events, the work is favorably progressing. 
Health prevails among the missionaries, and we never had a group more 



ELDER JAMES H. MOYLE 



87 



faithful or devoted, uniformly, than we have at the present time. Al- 
though our numbers have been reduced to less than one-third of what 
they were at the time I was called to preside over that mission, our con- 
verts baptized last year were over fifty per cent more than the preceding 
year, which was a somewhat normal year. 

The tithing paid in the Eastern States Mission is a demonstration 
to me of the fact that the Lord is blessing the honest tithe-payer. Not- 
withstanding the chaotic conditions, financially, that prevail, the tithing 
in the mission last year exceeded that of any other year in the history of 
the mission, excepting 1930 and 1931. A very substantial portion of 
that tithing is paid by western members who have moved into the East, 
some of whom, and especially young men, were non-tithe-payers at home. 
•Notwithstanding their isolation and associations, which would seem to 
cause them to further depart from the faith, they are more devoted. 
This shows something of the strength and vitality that there is in Mor- 
monism, as it is called, where it has been taught and practiced in the home. 

I believe that the same is true with reference to the Word of 
Wisdom. I am grateful to the Lord that I inherited, I might say, a 
knowledge of the divinity of the Word of Wisdom, and was trained in 
the home of Latter-day Saints to obey it. I believe, as firmly as I believe 
anything, if I do not know it, that I am enjoying the fruits, in a sub- 
stantial way, of a life's effort to obey the Word of Wisdom, and sot 
testify to the world. When I tell people of the fact, that so many, as I 
know, of our young people went through the World War without ac- 
quiring the habit of using tobacco, and I am able to say, with great 
pleasure and satisfaction, that such was the case with my own sons, 
it arouses astonishment in the minds of thinking men and increases re- 
spect for Mormonism. 

This is a marvelous work and a wonder, and has a remarkable hold 
upon the young and the old. In the Eastern states there are more large 
cities than anywhere else in the country, and in the work of this Taber- 
nacle Choir and Organ there is, in my opinion, the greatest missionary 
that we have. I have marveled, of late, when the newspapers in some 
of these cities reported, as a matter of news, the names of our brethren 
who would preside at the console of this great organ, on the following 
Sunday. They also give the name of the leader of the Choir, and the 
details of the program to be rendered over the radio. Their names are 
becoming familiar household names among many of the lovers of music 
throughout the nation. These broadcasts are softening the hearts of 
the people. 

It had not occurred to me until coming to this conference that it 
might be significant that the pioneering of the work of preaching the 
Gospel over the radio in our mission originated on the Susquehanna 
River, not far from where the holy priesthood was restored in this 
dispensation, that is, in the city of Wilkesbarre, on the north line of 
Pennsylvania and near the southern line of New York. Since starting 
there we have preached the Gospel every week over the same radio 
now for the past two years and eight months. The locality in which 
we have had the greatest radio success seems to be that which surrounds 



88 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



the Hill Cumorah and the sacred grove — Wilkesbarre on the northeast, 
Jamestown, New York, on the northwest, Buffalo and Syracuse on the 
north. When I informed one of the officers of the Columbia Broadcasting- 
System, last week, that within the last two years and eight months we 
had broadcast eight hundred and eighty-eight programs over the air, by 
very young untrained amateurs, boys and girls of from nineteen to twenty- 
two or twenty-three years of age, without any previous preparation or 
special education, he said that there was nothing comparable with it. 
I asked him if he wouldn't write me a letter to that effect, and I received 
one yesterday confirming that statement. He said that there had been 
some extended programs by great preachers, like Dr. Fosdick of New 
York, but that there was nothing comparable with this work that is 
being carried on by the Church in the Eastern States Mission. 

Now, let me beg of those who do have the resources, to help mis- 
sionaries in need. If you could only hear the pathetic appeals and prayers 
that are being offered by some of our young missionaries who want to 
remain and fulfil their missions but are compelled to go home for lack 
of funds your hearts would be touched. My time is past, but let me again 
appeal to you. If individuals or families alone are not able to support a 
missionary in the field, especially after he has been there long enough to 
become really useful, cannot two or three families join together and help 
each other keep missionaries in the field r I do beg and pray that the mis- 
sionaries who are there, whom we have trained and fitted for this work, 
may be able to continue and complete their mission. Many people are 
ready to listen to the Gospel, as they have not been heretofore. They 
are humbled and ready for it. 

May God bless this great work, I pray, in the name of Jesus, Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I consider it one of the greatest compliments that cotdd possibly be 
paid to our organ and choir recitals that the Columbia Broadcasting 
System — nation-wide — should request us to lengthen our Sunday pro- 
grams from a half hour to an hour. It is said that the testing of a thing 
is what counts. The doubling of the program is a splendid testimony of 
its value, and we all feel grateful to the choir and organists. It is no 
small task for them to prepare and rehearse their numbers and then come 
here and spend a full hour every Sunday morning playing and singing 
to the people of the world. 

I endorse all the good things that have been said about the leader 
of the choir, our organists and the members of the choir themselves. 

All those who wish to hear the choir and organ broadcast Sunday 
morning should be quietly seated in this building by half past nine. 

The "Singing Mothers" rendered the anthem, "The Heavens are 
Telling." 

Benediction by Elder Colen H. Sweeten. President of the Curlew 
Stake. 

Conference adjourned until 10 o'clock Sunday morning, April 9. 



THIRD DAY 



MORNING MEETING 

Sunday morning, April 9. 

Every seat, every available space in the great auditorium and galleries 
of the Tabernacle was occupied before 9:30. Hundreds of people who 
could not find accommodations in the Tabernacle assembled in the large 
Assembly Hall on the Tabernacle grounds, where they .listened to the 
proceedings of this meeting as they were broadcast by radio. 

As a prelude to the regular Conference services an hour's program of 
choral and organ music was rendered by the Tabernacle Choir and 
Organ, from 9:30 to 10:30, and broadcast by radio from the Tabernacle 
over the Columbia Broadcasting System. This program, which originated 
over Station KSL and was broadcast throughout the nation — and by 
short wave to Europe — was as follows : 

"Arise, O Glorious Zion" — Choir. 

"Largo" (Handel)— Organ. 

"The Palms" (Faure)— Choir. 

"Rienzi March" (Wagner) — Organ. 

"Come thou O Joy of Nations" (Gates) — Choir. 

"Andante Religioso" (Thome)— Organ. 

"The Morning Breaks" (Careless) — Choir. 

"Toccata from the Widor Symphony" — Organ. 

"Build thee more Stately Mansions" (Farwell) — Choir. 

"The Holy City" (Adams)— Organ. 

"Jesus Only" (Rotoli)— Choir. 

"Walter's Prize Song" (Wagner) — Organ. 

"Thanks be to God" (Mendelssohn) — Choir. 

The Tabernacle Choir was conducted by Anthony C. Lund. Ed- 
ward P. Kimball played the organ accompaniments, and Frank W. 
Asper played the organ solo presentations. 

At the close of the Choir and Organ broadcast President Heber J. 
Grant announced that the Choir and congregation would sing the hymn, 
"Praise to the man who communed with Jehovah." 

After the singing of this hymn the opening prayer was offered by 
Elder Winslow Farr Smith, President of the Ensign Stake. 

ELDER DAVID O. McKAY 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

Seldom if ever have I enjoyed a conference more than I have this. 
The high standard set at the opening session has been maintained 
at each succeeding one. Not only that, but the meetings that have 
been held in addition to the regular sessions have been highly in- 



90 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



spiring, beginning with the meeting of the Council of the Twelve, the 
First Council of Seventy and the Mission Presidents last Tuesday, 
and continuing to the educational meeting held this morning at 
eight o'clock. That session last night in which were assembled over 
five thousand men holding the priesthood was most encouraging. 
Just to behold that army was an inspiration. I think this conference 
will take its place among the most impressive conferences ever held 
in the Church, in its timely teaching, in its spiritual uplift, in the 
awakening of a desire to live better, and in its confirmation of the 
truth of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. 

I wish that this influence, particularly as it relates to the evils of 
tobacco and strong drink might be felt all over our nation and that 
the people would be guided thereby, as I sincerely trust that the 
members of the Church will be guided by it. 

FACING AN IMPORTANT QUESTION 

I should like to say a few words regarding a great question that 
is related to the general theme of this conference. Our nation is 
facing it. and we as part of that nation must express ourselves re- 
garding it. I have in mind the question of the repeal of the Eigh- 
teenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. 

"Once to every man and nation comes the moment to decide; 
In the strife of Truth with Falsehood, for the good or evil side; 
Some great cause, God's new Messiah, offering each the bloom or blight, 
Parts the goats upon the left hand and the sheep upon the right, 
And the choice goes by forever 'twixt that darkness and that light." 

When James Russell Lowell wrote those lines he had in mind 
the great problem of slavery — "The earth born Cyclops, fellest of the 
giant brood." In that issue the people of the United States chose 
sides and the struggle though bitter and tragic ended in driving one 
form of slavery from our shores forever. 

Today the liquor question, another earth-born giant, stalks 
through the land and the question of how best to shackle him is now 
put squarely before the people. 

CHANGES IN PUBLIC SENTIMENT 

Fewer than fifteen years have passed since the Eighteenth 
Amendment was ratified by the largest number of states and by the 
largest percentage of states that ever ratified any amendment to the 
Constitution in the entire history of our country. 

That action was taken as the cumulative result of several hun- 
dred years' experience with the evils of the liquor traffic. Now after 
a little more than a decade of Prohibition, because of a few difficul- 
ties in enforcement, many people cry for a return to old conditions. 
It was just such sudden changes in the public opinion and acclaim 
that made James Fitz James cry out : 

"O thou many-headed thing 
Who would wish to be thy king?" 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY 



91 



This reversal of sentiment is due in general to one of two condi- 
tions — perhaps both. Either Prohibition has failed to achieve the 
results anticipated, or the people finding themselves in such desper- 
ate financial straits are being swept off their feet in their eagerness 
to grasp anything which offers relief. 

When the world war broke out many men cried, "Christianity 
has failed." Just as they now cry, "Prohibition has failed." Others 
answered then that Christianity had never been tried, that it was 
the violation of Christian principles that brought on the war. So we 
answer today : Prohibition has not failed, it has not been sufficiently 
tested. If public sentiment is against it, Prohibition cannot be en- 
forced, .but if the majority of people favor it, it can be enforced. Now 
we are engaged in the struggle to test that sentiment. 

Three reasons why the Eighteenth Amendment should not be 
repealed : 

RESULTS OF HONEST INVESTIGATION 

Because Prohibition is the most effective means of dealing with 
the liquor evil. I believe that the results of honest investigation and 
unbiased observation prove the truth of this assertion. For example, 
arrests for drunkenness in fifty leading cities, statistics of which 
were collected by Judge Gemmill of the Municipal Court of Chicago, 
fell from 302,071 in 1917 to 110,149 in 1920— a decrease of 63%. 

Mr. Robert Carradini made a survey of 185 cities, the complete 
statistics of which show that the average annual number of arrests 
for intoxication per thousand of population in the four years preced- 
ing 1917 was 23,4% and that number in 1920 had fallen to 8.7%, a 
reduction of 62 % . 

Figures presented before the sub-committee of the Committee 
on Judiciary, United States Senate, April, 1926, showed data cover- 
ing statistics in 626 cities from 1917 to 1920. The number of arrests 
for drunkenness in all these 626 cities was less than 36% as great 
in 1920 as in 1917. From the same authority we learn that prison 
commitments decreased 59% and there was a decrease of crime of 
over 40%. 

It is true that since that time anti-prohibitionists can cite sta- 
tistics showing: (1) An increase of arrests for drunkenness since 
1920. (2) An increase of deaths from alcoholism since 1920. (3) 
An increase in insanity since 1920. They can show further that yr 
1924 the arrests for drunkenness were double what they were in 
1920, but even then they were less than three-fourths of what they 
were before Prohibition. 

MORAL AND ECONOMIC BENEFITS 

Early in 1922 the Manufacturers' Record sent a questionnaire to 
hundreds of leading men of affairs including large manufacturers, 
employers of labor, bankers, and university professors asking their 
judgment about Prohibition. 98J/> % favored Prohibition in some 



92 GENERAL CONFERENCE 

form. Some of the moral and economic benefits as they appeared 
to these men follow : 

Happier homes with more contentment. Cleaner and better 
social life. 

Increased purchasing power of homes, food and clothes for 
women and children. 

A change in the habits and expenditures of the workers. Men 
are buying their own homes, have savings accounts and own auto- 
mobiles. 

A tendency toward thrift, contentment, comfort and happiness. 
Families better cared for, and increased savings deposits. 

More and cleaner recreation. Picture shows, parks, outdoor 
excursions. 

Less loss of time. Fewer accidents, less incompetence, less 
carelessness, less inefficiency, better work, better homes. 
Children and young people getting a better education. 
School attendance improved. Public and Sunday School. 
Improvement in community morale. 

An incalculable economic and moral blessing to millions of our 
people and to the nation as a whole. 

THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE IN INDIVIDUAL GOVERNMENT 

In my advocacy for Prohibition I keep ever in mind the import- 
ance of that great principle which Joseph Smith enunciated when he 
was asked how he governed his people so well. He answered : "I 
teach them correct principles and they govern themselves." That 
is the fundamental principle in the United States in individual gov- 
ernment and when an individual becomes converted to a condition 
he can live up to it. When we get the majority of the people con- 
verted to a condition that will favor temperance the law will be en- 
forced. 

But there is another condition also. We are living in a democ- 
racy. The majority of the people determine the kind of laws by 
which the people should be governed. That being true we are now 
facing a proposition to determine what the majority of the people 
desire. I believe that the American people desire temperance. I 
have given one reason why I think that the retention of the Eigh- 
teenth Amendment will foster and favor temperance. 

A STEP BACKWARD 

There is a second reason which I will just name and that is the 
proposed amendment offers no new remedy for existing evils. If 
the Twenty-first Amendment is ratified the question of Prohibition 
is thrown back upon the states and that is one step backward in the 
cause of temperance. The smaller the prohibitive area, the greater 
the difficulty of enforcement. The wider the area, the more effective 
the enforcement. 

You who were on the firing line in this Prohibition fight will 



ELDER DAVID 0. McKAY 



93 



remember how we first began to make towns dry, then counties, then 
states, and finally the question was made nation-wide. Now to step 
back and go into the states as proposed by the Twenty-first Amendment 
is merely to take a step backward. 

IN NEED OF MOKE SPIRITUALITY 

A third reason for my opposing the repeal of the Eighteenth 
Amendment is this : 

The world today perhaps as never before needs more spiritu- 
ality. Booze and depravity mingle together harmoniously, but booze 
and spirituality, never. 

In an excellent editorial last Thursday morning one of our 
daily papers impressively said : "Excessive materialism stands in- 
dicted in the minds of men. There needs to be inaugurated a new 
era of mutual accord, a return to an appreciation of the finer 
things of life, to the basic principles of human existence." 

No one will contend that intoxicating liquors contribute spirit- 
uality either to the individual or to the nation. Nearly everyone con- 
cedes that intoxicants develop the baser, not the finer things of life. 

"they shall not pass" 

Sixteen years ago there was a terrific battle being waged at 
Verdun. On June 7, 1916, the French vacated the city Damloup un- 
der the hill on which Fort Vaux was situated. The defense of this 
Fort was one of outstanding heroism, and Major Raynal, the com- 
mander, was treated with every honor as a prisoner of the Germans. 

Fort Vaux had fallen and other outer lines were broken through, 
but there was an inner circle of defense that was invincible. The 
words of General Petain, "They shall not pass," thrilled the heart 
and nerved the arm of every French soldier. For more than two 
long months the Germans hammered and battered at that inner de- 
fense in the most terrific conflict in the annals of war. In the last 
desperate assault of the Crown Prince, 40,000 German soldiers were 
slaughtered in a hopeless effort to break through the French curtain 
of fire. The inner circle of defense was impregnable. The main 
line held. 

Today we witness the legalization of beer by the United States 
government. Qne of our outer defences has fallen and the enemy 
spurred on by victory will attack others. But the inner defence, the 
18th. Amendment, must be defended at all costs. Let the words of 
General Petain, "They shall not pass," strengthen every heart and nerve 
every hand in defense of this part of the Constitution of the United States. 

god's word given authoritatively 

In addition to the fact that we believe that Prohibition is the 
best means of fighting the evil, that the proposal of the Twenty-first 
Amendment offers no other remedy which we do not have, and that 



94 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



the cause of spirituality demands that we retain it, I will add in con- 
clusion this thought : 

Out of the high plane of spirituality comes the message from 
the President of the Church given to the world that intoxicating 
liquors, strong drink, and tobacco are not good for man. That is 
God's word given authoritatively and on that truth we stand. I 
know I need not urge this upon you people. I believe with President 
Ivins that Utah will stand firm in accordance with its vote years 
ago in ratifying the Eighteenth Aniendment. 

"For right is right since God is God, 

And right the day must win ; 
To doubt would mean disloyalty, 

To falter would be sin." 

God help us to stand true to the principles of right as we know 
them in our souls and as God has revealed them to us, I pray in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

A vocal solo, "The. Blind Plowman," was sung by Melvin Watson. 

PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 

First Counselor in the First Presidency 

I have been profoundly impressed, my brethren and sisters, with 
the proceedings of the Conference. From the beginning until the present 
one thought has been uppermost in my mind, a thought so fundamental 
in the Church that I have written some notes from which I wish to call 
your attention to it. At this time, when moments are so precious, I have 
endeavored to concentrate, and for that reason, as I say, I prepared these 
notes. 

JOSEPH smith's first vision 

It was in the early spring of 1820, one hundred and thirteen years 
ago, that Joseph Smith, who at that time was in his fifteenth year, 
received his first heavenly manifestation. In the vision he saw the Father 
and the Son, and as one of those glorious personages pronounced his 
name the boy heard that divine injunction, given nearly two thousand 
years before to the people of the American continent: "This is my 1 
beloved Son. Hear him." 

He had gone to the Lord for a specific purpose. He was in doubt 
as to which of the conflicting creeds, each professing faith in Jesus Christ, 
was accepted by the Lord and which he should join. 

The answer to his question was definite. The personage addressed 
said to him that he was to join none of them; that they had all gone 
astray ; that they worshiped him with their lips, but their hearts were 
removed far from him, and they taught for doctrine the commandments 
of men. 

A MESSENGER SENT FROM GOD 

Three years elapsed. The boy was approaching manhood. During 
the years which had passed, in the face of persecution and ridicule, he 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 



95 



had maintained that he had seen a vision and had heard the voices of the 
Father and the Son. 

On the twenty-first da}- of September, after Joseph had retired 
for the night, he again engaged in prayer to his Father in heaven. In 
response to his petition he says : 

"While I was thus in the act of calling upon God, I discovered a light appearing 
in my room, which continued to increase until the room was lighter than at noon- 
day, when immediately a personage appeared at my bedside, standing in the air, 
for his feet did not touch the floor. He had on a loose robe of exquisite whiteness. 
* * * His hands were naked, and his arms also, a little above the wrist ; so also were 
his feet naked, as were his legs a little above the ankles. * * * His whole person was 
glorious beyond description, and his countenance truly like lightning." 

He spoke to Joseph telling him that he was a messenger sent from 
the presence of God, and that his name was Moroni.; that the Lord had 
a work for him to do, and that his name should be had for good and 
evil among all nations. 

The messenger declared the existence of a book, written upon plates 
of metal which contained the history of the ancient inhabitants of the 
American continent — the Book of Mormon. 

QUOTES PROPHET JOEL 

Among other scripture quoted by the messenger was the following 
from the prophet Joel, which he said had not yet been fulfilled, but was 
soon to be : 

"I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh ; and your sons and your daughters 
shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions ; 

"And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour 
out my spirit. 

"And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood and fire, and 
pillars of smoke. 

"The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the 
great and terrible day of the Lord come. 

"And it shall come to pass, that whosoever, shall call on the name of the 
Lord shall be delivered ; for in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be deliverance, as 
the Lord hath said, and in the remnant whom the Lord shall call." 

RECEIVES PLATES 

Four years after the visitation of Moroni on September 22nd, 1827, 
the plates referred to were entrusted to Joseph Smith, and on April 7th, 
104 years ago, he began the translation of the Book of Mormon, Oliver 
Cowdery acting as his scribe. 

AUTHORITY RESTORED 

As the translation proceeded it was discovered that the people to 
whom the record referred practiced the ordinance of baptism by im- 
mersion for the remission of sins. Following his usual custom, Joseph 
Smith, with Oliver Cowdery, retired to the woods and they engaged in 
prayer. The answer came in a flood of light from heaven. John the 
Baptist stood bef ore them, and laying his hands upon them said : 

"Upon you, my fellow servants, in the name of Messiah I confer the Priest- 



96 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



hood of Aaron, which holds the keys of the ministering of angels, and of the gospel 
of repentance, and of baptism by immersion for the remission of sins ; and this shall 
never be taken again from the earth, until the sons of Levi do offer again an offering 
unto the Lord in righteousness." 

He told them that this Aaronic priesthood had not the power of 
laying on hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost, but that this should 
be conferred later. 

With the restoration of the Aaronic priesthood and the greater 
Melchizedek priesthood, which was later conferred as promised, au- 
thority to speak and act for God was restored, with all of the keys 
which existed in the primitive church. 

THE CHURCH ORGANIZED 

On the 6th day of April, 1830, one hundred and three years ago, 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was legally organized 
as the law required that it should be, and the proclamation of the re- 
stored Gospel was heralded to the people of the world. 

One of the chief criticisms which opponents of the Church have 
advanced in their opposition to it is that it claims authority which comes 
direct from God and that this authority was restored by men who had 
lived and passed from mortal existence long ago. 

BY DIVINE AUTHORITY 

Xo objection can be advanced by a person who is familiar with the 
life and ministry of Jesus Christ and the teachings of the Bible, to the 
doctrines taught by the Church. It is the declaration which the Church 
makes that it is by divine authority that it came into existence and 
continues to exist, authority which came direct from God our Father 
through Jesus Christ his Son, the agency employed in the restoration 
being messengers sent from the presence of our Father in heaven to 
Joseph Smith, the medium through whom it was carried to the people 
of the world. 

Why should the manner of the restoration appear a strange thing 
and be a stumbling block to people who profess acceptance of the Bible 
as the guide by which their faith and the conduct of their lives are to 
be governed? Has it not always been so? Is the manner of the restora- 
tion different from that which the Father has always adopted in com- 
municating his will to his children here upon earth? Let us examine and 
see. 

HEAVENLY MESSENGERS SENT TO EARTH 

To refer to the number of times and the various purposes for which 
the Lord has spoken to the inhabitants of our earth, to the occasions 
when messengers, referred to as angels, have been sent to earth, would 
require much more time than is at my disposal. 

From Adam to Noah, from Noah to Abraham, and from Abraham 
to Christ, the Lord has at divers times and under different cir- 
cumstances spoken to us, always calling us back to him, warning 
us to beware of the seducing influence of Lucifer, the son of Perdi- 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 



97 



tipn, the Devil, who was cast down from the presence of God, who 
is the enemy of all that is good, and who is here upon earth, his sole 
ambition being to lead men and women away from Christ and reduce 
them to his own miserable condition of unhappiness. 

ACCOMPANIED BY LIGHT 

It will be observed that where the presence of the Lord is manifested 
it is accompanied by light; it is the brightness of the sun, the glory of, a 
perfect day. The presence or influence of the tempter brings with it 
darkness, clouds, depression and ultimate death, for he is the author of 
death. 

The angel of the Lord appeared to Moses in a bush which appeared 
to burn but was not consumed. It was a living light which radiated from 
the glory of the person, and not a consuming fire. 

The angel who appeared to Zacharias and announced the birth of 
John the Baptist, declared himself to be Gabriel who stood in the presence 
of God. The Bible tells us that this same messenger — Gabriel — was sent 
from God to the Virgin Mary to announce to her that she was to become 
the mother of the Redeemer of the world. 

On that eventful night, while the shepherds watched over their 
flocks upon the hills of Judea, light suddenly appeared in the heavens, 
the angel of the Lord appeared unto them and they were sore afraid. 
But the angel said unto them : 

"Fear not: for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be 
to all people. 

"For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, which is Christ 
the Lord, * * * 

"And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host 
praising God, and saying, 

"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men. 

We are told in the Bible that "after six days Jesus taketh Peter, James and 
John, his brother, and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart. 

"And was transfigured before them : and his face did shine as the sun, and his 
raiment was white as the light. 

"And, behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him. 

"Then answered Peter, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here : 
if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles ; one for thee, and one for Moses, 
and one for Elias." 

In passing let me remark that Moses lived more than 1500 years 
before the birth of Christ, and Elias nearly 1000 years. 

"While he yet spake, behold a bright cloud overshadowed them : and behold 
a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well 
pleased; hear ye him." — That same eternal message. 

"And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and were sore afraid. 

"And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not afraid." 

Paul's experience 

The Apostle Paul was an educated Jew. He tells us that he had 
taught and had lived the life of the s'trictest sect among the Jews, a 
Pharisee. He was a persecutor of the church, even consenting to the 
death of some of its members. He tells us that as he journeyed to 



i 



98 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



Damascus, with authority and commission to proceed with his plan of 
persecution, he saw a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, 
shining about him and those who journeyed with him. And when they 
had all fallen to the earth he heard a voice from heaven saying in the 
Hebrew tongue: "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?" Paul an- 
swered, "Who art thou, Lord ?" and the answer came : "I am Jesus whom 
thou persecutest." 

Again the light from heaven, again the prostration of those upon 
whom it fell, again the voice of Jehovah revealing the truth to an un- 
believing world through one whom he had chosen, unconsciously to 
Paul, to be his special witness to the Gentiles. 

AN ANGEL APPEARS UNTO JOHN 

Among the more important revelations given by God to man is that 
known as the Apocalypse, or Revelation of St. John, the divine, the 
beloved disciple of our Lord. John was on the Island of Patmos, in the 
Aegean Sea, at the time, where he had been banished by decree of Rome 
and made to work in the mines or stone quarries. It was under these 
circumstances that this sublime revelation was given. It is : 

"The revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to show unto his 
servants things which must shortly come to pass ; and he sent and signified it by 
his angel to his servant John." 

Then follows this wonderful revelation, which makes known the 
past, deals with the present, and foretells the future as no other revelation 
in the Bible does. When the messenger had concluded his errand, John 

says: 

"And I John saw these things and heard them. And when I had heard and seen, 
I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which showed me these things. 

"Then saith he unto me, See thou do it not: for I am thy fellow servant, 
and, of thy brethren the prophets, and of them which keep the sayings of this 
book : worship God." 

DIVINE COMMUNICATIONS FORETOLD 

My purpose in referring to the various scriptures from which I 
have quoted — and there are many more of them — is to call attention to 
the fact that communication between our Father in heaven and his 
children who are here upon earth, is not an unreasonable thing ; in fact, 
in consideration of the words of the prophets and the Redeemer himself, 
it was to be expected. 

Jesus, when asked by his disciples, What shall be the sign of thy 
coming ?, declared that before his coming the gospel of the kingdom 
would be preached in all the world as a witness to all people. 

John, the beloved disciple, to whom reference has been made, defi- 
nitely declares the manner in which the restoration is to be effected 
in the following words : 

"I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting Gospel 
to preach to them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred and 
tongue, and people."

IN A FLOOD OF LIGHT 

One of the peculiarities attendant upon the appearance of a mes- 
senger sent from the presence of God is that he comes in a flood of 
heavenly light. 

As Moses tended the flocks of his father-in-law, Jethro, on Mount 
Horeb, the Bible tells us, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a 
flame of fire out of the midst of the bush, and the bush burned with fire 
and was not consumed. 

As Paul journeyed toward Damascus, a light from heaven, brighter 
than the sun, descended upon him and those who were with him, and 
they fell to the earth. From the midst of the light he heard the voice 
of the Lord. 

As the shepherds kept watch over their flocks by night on the hills 
of Judea, a light — the glory of the Lord — shone around them and they 
were sore afraid as the angel of the Lord announced to them the birth 
of a Savior, who was Christ the Lord. 

Let us return for a moment to Joseph Smith. As he offered his 
first prayer, when about to succumb to the powers of darkness which 
sought to overwhelm him, he says that a pillar of light, above the bright- 
ness of the sun, fell upon him, as he saw and heard the Father and the 
Son. When the vision terminated he says: "When I came to myself 
I found myself lying upon my back, looking up into heaven." 

Again with the appearance of the Angel Moroni the room in which 
Joseph slept became lighter than at noonday. With the departure of the 
messenger the room again became dark. 

John the Baptist, who restored the Aaronic priesthood, descended 
in a cloud of light. 

IN HARMONY WITH REASON AND TRUTH 

It was not because of his familiarity with the scriptures that Joseph 
Smith was capable of formulating a plan of restoration, organization and 
administration so completely in harmony with the revealed word of the 
Lord. The knowledge came to him little by little, line upon line, precept 
after precept, as the Lord revealed it to him. The story of the restoration 
has withstood the ridicule of the ignorant and the criticism of the learned 
for more than a century, without detection of an error in the plan. It is 
in harmony with the revealed will of God and the reason of man. In 
humility and with full consciousness of the responsibility involved we 
reaffirm that the manner of the restoration as referred to is true. 

TRUTH UNCHANGEABLE 

Truth remains the same throughout the ages. Our surroundings 
may change, as they have done during the past century — a century which 
has brought to us development in science, in invention and worldly 
knowledge greater than all the centuries that have preceded it, until we 
find ourselves living in a new world. But God's revealed truth is the same, 
and it will be unchanged through the eternities to come. He is the same 
good Heavenly Father who walked and talked with Adam, who preserved 



100 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



the human family through Noah, who called Abraham and entered into 
covenant with him. The same who sent his Only Begotten Son to earth, 
with power to break the band of death with which Lucifer held us 
bound, and redeemed us to everlasting life. 

It is through God our Father that the gospel of salvation has been 
restored, Christ our Lord, his Only Begotten Son, being the agent through 
whom he acts, and he in turn communicates the will of the Father to us 
by messengers sent from his presence. He is the author of this intricate 
and yet simple organization which we refer to as the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints. It is by authority from him that we exer- 
cise the gift of the holy priesthood. 

FOUNDER OF THE GOVERNMENT 

Just as our Father in heaven, through Christ his Son, is the founder 
of the Church, so is he the founder of the government by which we are 
— or should be if we are not — controlled in civil affairs. He it was 
who brought the Pilgrim fathers and those who followed after to the 
shores of New England. He has said that he established the Constitution 
of our country by the hands of wise men whom he raised up for that very 
purpose, and redeemed the land by the shedding of blood. 

Both the Church and the government have experienced periods oi 
deep affliction since their establishment. Both have been assailed by 
enemies from without and foes within which have threatened disruption. 
Each in time of trial has found strong hearts and arms to sustain it. 

CONFUSION REIGNS 

Never before has either the state or the Church been confronted 
with circumstances more pregnant of good and evil than at the present 
time, when more ominous clouds have hung over a troubled world. 
Confusion reigns among the nations, our own included. The very 
elements combine to add to the uncertainty and distress. 

To refer in detail even briefly to the present condition of the people 
of this troubled world of ours and the causes which have brought us 
to our present condition of tribulation, is not my intention. The great 
World War, the most wicked, unjustifiable, unnecessary war the world 
has ever known, laid the foundation for it. The monetary cost of the 
war left the world bankrupt. In our own country it was followed by 
an era of extravagance, selfishness and money madness, the like of 
which had never before been known. And the war still goes on. Not 
a war of swords and bayonets, but a war of the nations for possession 
of a small pile of gold, inadequate if we possessed it all, to pay the 
mortgages on the farms of our country and the debt of the men who 
owe them, and yet that pile of gold is the only money of ultimate redemp- 
tion recognized by the civilized nations today. 

DELIVERANCE WILL COME 

You need not call our attention to our unfortunate condition, you 
are saying to yourselves, we are all too well aware of that. Tell us 
how to extricate ourselves from it. If I had the wisdom to do that I 



PRESIDENT ANTHONY W. IVINS 101 



would be the happiest man in the world. That we will survive and 
emerge from it a wiser, happier and better people I am confident, what- 
ever our suffering may be before we win the victory. It will not come 
through the Sovietism of Russia, the Socialism of France, the Fascists 
of Italy, nor the Nazis of Hitler. It will not come by the brewing and 
disposition of more beer or the manufacture and drinking of more wine. 
It will not come from the manufacture and distribution of more cigarets 
for our boys and girls to smoke. It will come to our country, if it is to 
come at all, through the united effort of the American people, whose soul 
I believe will turn to the Lord. 

Deliverance will not come by a miracle from heaven, but I believe 
the Lord will endow us with wisdom and with his help we will work 
out our deliverance. If the Lord for the sake of ten righteous men 
would spare Sodom and Gomorrah, will he not spare this government, 
which he declares he has established, for the sake of the many thousands 
of honest souls which make up its citizenship? 

CONCERNING THE CHURCH 

What of the Church? We call upon its members, as we have always 
done, to turn to the Lord for succor. Remember the words which 
I have quoted from the Prophet Joel, words which had not been fulfilled 
at the time, but were soon to be. He has promised that if we will do this 
he will return to us. 

In the words of the Prophet Joel which I have quoted : "In Mount 
Zion" — which is here in this land of Joseph — "and in Jerusalem de- 
liverance will be found," and his word will not fail. 

My faith in the membership of the Church is unshaken. By faith, 
with works added, we will carry the Church through to glorious triumph, 
regardless of the sacrifices which may be required. We dug ourselves into 
our present condition and with the help of the Lord and the loyal support 
of the government, both Church and state will emerge stronger in faith, 
and more powerful in influence than we have ever before been. 

These are the, thoughts which have been running through my mind, 
my brethren and sisters, during these services. I bear witness to you 
that the story I have told is true. The restoration was by divine inter- 
position of God our Father. It will persist, it will not be destroyed again 
as has been the case in ages which have passed. God grant that we may 
have faith to hold fast to the "rod of iron," give our loyal support to the 
government ; and as I said last night at the priesthood meeting, the gov- 
ernment needs us and we need the government. Both are everlasting 
truth. 

God bless you, I pray, through Jesus Christ, Amen. 

PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 

Second Counselor in the First Presidency 

My brethren and sisters, may I have your faith and your prayers on 
this occasion? I believe I voice the feelings of all of you when I say, 
thank God for our choir, for its leader, and for the organists. May I say 



102 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



thank the Lord also for the organ, built when we were in our infancy, 
unexcelled at the time and unrivalled still in the spirit and the hope of 
its message. We who have been in f oreign lands and have had its con- 
soling tones in our midnight hours of anxiety, know something of its 
message of peace. We know something of the way in which the Lord's 
word and his music may be made to fill the earth. 

PAYS TRIBUTE TO SENATOR SMOOT 

I want to take this occasion to thank my Heavenly Father, as a 
member of this Church, for the return amongst us of one whom I regard 
as the greatest missionary of his own generation. I refer to the Honor- 
able Reed Smoot. 

I went East to live at about the time he went into the Senate. I 
know something of the feeling that then existed toward us. I have 
seen the smile of disdain and the curl of the lip of scorn at the statement 
that one was a Mormon. During the thirty years of Senator Smoot's 
tenure of office, I have lived a great part of my time in the East in the 
same environment to which both of us went when he went into the 
Senate. I want now to say to you, brethren and sisters, that, judged 
at any rate by my human wisdom and understanding, no other contribut- 
ing cause equals that of the service which he has furnished, to the change 
that has come among the people of the earth who now honor and respect 
where formerly they scorned and despised. Furthermore Senator Smoot 
has given to his country a devoted service rarely equalled and never 
excelled. 

FEELS RESPONSIBILITY 

I am keenly aware of and am deeply grateful for the great honor 
the people have bestowed upon me. I am also aware that a responsibility 
equally great comes with that honor. May I say that just now I am 
thinking more about the responsibility than about the honor. 

Should any of you have hopes about my work in this high office 
to which I am called, I trust I shall not too much disappoint you. If 
any of you have misgivings, I can only say that your misgivings can 
hardly be greater than my own. I am keenly conscious of my own 
deficiencies. I come late in life to a new work. 

But whatever shall be the outcome of my humble service, whatever 
shall overtake me, there shall be yet abiding with all of us eternal truth, 
which is light and life, even life everlasting. 

We shall still know that "The glory of God is intelligence" and 
that we, his children, are heirs to and subjects of that same law, for the 
glory of man is intelligence likewise. 

There will still be with us the knowledge that man was not made 
merely that he might suffer pain and want and sorrow, but that "Men 
are that they might have joy," — a joy that is not the passing pleasures 
of the flesh nor of worldly riches, but the joy of a clean body and a 
clean mind, the joy of right living, the joy of growth and progress, the 
joy of brotherly comradeship one with another, the joy of spiritual 
communion with the Infinite, the joy of the knowledge of everlasting 
life and eternal progression. 



PRESIDENT J. REUBEN CLARK, JR. 103 



NO SUBSTITUTE FOR WORK 

We shall have the joy of work too, for man also is that he might 
work, he went forth from the innocence of Eden to the God-like knowl- 
edge of good and evil, with the Divine blessing — not curse — as it seems 
to me: "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread." And save in 
extremity, no man may rightfully violate that law by living by the sweat 
from the brow of his brother. It is the eternal, inescapable law that 
growth comes only from work and preparation, whether the growth be 
material, mental, or spiritual. Work has no substitute. Idleness brings 
neither profit, nor advantage, nor good — only a withering decay and 
death. The world is near to forgetting all this ; I hope that we as a 
people shall keep it ever in remembrance, for in proportion as it is for- 
gotten, evil will rule. 

THE WORLD'S PROBLEM 

The world is moaning in tribulation. I do not know the cure. The 
questions involved are so nearly infinite in their vastness, that I question 
whether any human mind can answer them. But it is my faith that if 
the people shall shun idleness ; if they shall cast out from their hearts 
those twin usurpers, ambition and greed, and then shall re-enthrone 
brotherly love, and return to the old time virtues — industry, thrift, 
honesty, self-reliance, independence of spirit, self -discipline, and mutual 
helpfulness — we shall be far on our way to returned prosperity and 
worldly happiness. We must again yield fealty to the law that moulder- 
ing wealth, however great, is a mere shadow compared with the living, 
enduring riches of the mind and heart. We must remember the com- 
mand given to Israel of old — "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thy self," 
which, says James, is "The royal law according to the scriptures." The 
world problem is not primarily one of finance, but of unselfishness, in- 
dustry, courage, confidence, character, heart, temperance, integrity, and 
righteousness. The world has been on a, wild debauch, materially and 
spiritually; it must recover in the same way the drunken reprobate 
recovers ; by repentance and right living. 

GOD WILL SPEAK 

We here are strengthened, even in our want, by the knowledge 
that in this wilderness of modernism, with its mounting error and 
multiplying nostrums, with its new thought and strange action, man is 
not left to wander, unguided save by the truth given to him when he 
moved in a different world, with different standards, problems, and 
ideals. For we know that the Almighty, in pace with the progress of his 
children, will speak to them from time to time, giving them further 
light and wisdom, measurable to their new needs in their new life. We 
know that individually each of us may so live that he may ask for Divine 
help with the assurance that aid will come. 

STILL THE GOOD SHEPHERD 

And in this time of stress, it is our right also to know that our 
Father has not forgotten us though we well nigh forgot him ; he has 



104 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



not shut the heavens from us ; he has not cast us out from his care ; 
he has not walled off his love against us. He is still the Good Shepherd, 
reaching after, watching over us,, with the tenderness of the Infinite. 
His love and his care are eternal. 

Standing before Capernaum Jesus said : "Come unto me all ye that 
labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest." 

To the multitude on the Mount, he said : "Seek ye first the kingdom 
of God and his righteousness and all these things shall be added." 

The Psalmist sang: "The judgments of the Lord are true and 
righteous altogether." 

Thus is the law, the promise, and the blessing. 

The Master, speaking' with spiritual intent, said to Simon Peter : 
"Feed my sheep." This command of the Savior makes it greater and 
nobler by infinity, to feed the mind and spirit of man than to crush his 
body or to break his will. It is my duty, it will be my effort, to follow 
after the mandate of the Master. To this service I pledge the best I have 
of experience, of wisdom, of faith. 

Nineteen hundred years ago today, as the historians count, Christ 
came in through the gates of Jerusalem to the temple, the multitude 
going before, bearing palm branches and crying : "Blessed be the king that 
cometh in the name of the Lord." The multitude cried out thinking him 
an earthly king; we know him as the sovereign of our souls, as the 
Redeemer of the World, as him who died that man might live. Let 
us not forget him nor his truth, lest we "crucify to ourselves the Son 
of God afresh." 

GIVES LIGHT 

God lives. We are his children. He has given back to earth his 
priesthood. He has spoken and is speaking through his prophets. To 
each of us he gives spiritual light just in the measure we are ready 
and willing to take it, and his blessings are ours, not for sinning diso- 
bedience to the truth already given, but through the righteous keeping 
thereof. We may not rightfully expect that God will flash either to our 
minds or to our spirits new knowledge for which we are not ready and 
for which we have no need. We may rightfully expect only that God 
will give new lessons when we have learned the old ones and they no 
longer serve our wants. 

God grant us the supreme knowledge, proclaimed by the Master on 
his way to the spiritual agony and ecstacy of Gethsemane: "And this 
is life eternal that they might know thee, the only true God, and Jesus 
Christ whom thou hast sent." 

To his children on this hemisphere Jesus said : "I am the light and 
life of the world," and to Martha, she of the almost perfect faith: "I 
am the resurrection and the life; he that believeth in me, though he 
were dead, yet shall he live ; and whosoever liveth and believeth in me 
shall never die." 

God grant to us the gifts of his Holy Spirit and provide us with 
the needful things of life. May he bless me with the spirit of my calling. 
Will you make your prayers in my behalf that I may do his service 
righteously ?

It is written in the scriptures : 

"But without faith it is impossible to please him : for he that cometh to God 
must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him." 

Sometimes people misunderstand this statement of faith and what 
it is. Some seem to believe that faith is merely a belief or an acceptance 
of the truth. The doctrine as taught by the Latter-day Saints clearly 
indicates that it is necessary not only to believe and to have knowledge 
but to put that knowledge into practice. More than that, faith is not 
only a belief with action, but also a confidence in God ; a belief of such 
a nature that we can accept and do his will and he will keep his promises 
to us. 

A week ago today I was in attendance at a conference of the 
Northern States Mission. The night previous there had been a Mutual 
Improvement contest in which the contestants of the Columbus Branch 
of the Church traveled nearly three hundred miles to the city of Detroit ; 
and singing, and speaking, and drama, and dancing were exhibited in 
that contest. At this conference and also at the evening entertainment 
were a very intelligent and splendid man and his wife. One of them was 
a direct descendant of the Prophet Joseph Smith. Also in attendance 
at that conference was a leading member of the faculty of the University 
of Ohio, who is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints. This gentleman and his wife invited this professor and myself 
to dinner, and I was somewhat startled at some of the questions that 
were asked by these good people, whom we love, though they are not 
members of the Church. 

The gentleman said that the particular reason for inviting us to 
dinner was that he wanted to ask Dr. Russell how it was that he, an 
educated man, a man who had attained prominence in the world in the 
educational field, still had faith in the story concerning Joseph Smith, 
the Prophet. He said that in his church, which is the Reorganized 
Church of the Latter-day Saints, whenever men became educated they 
no longer accepted that statement. And then he very frankly said : "We 
feel that there is something lacking in our church." 

Dr. Russell told him that he had a strong testimony that Joseph 
Smith was a prophet of God, and that his faith was just as sincere and 
just as earnest as that of any member of the congregation of that con- 
ference ; and not only that but he told him that throughout the educational 
institutions in the United States there were many men of that character. 

I believe, my brethren and sisters, that the Lord is pleading with 
these people, that the testimony of the truth is in their hearts, and that 
what is needed is greater faith. The world is in turmoil, but I do not 
believe that more knowledge will cure it. The thing that is needed 
is for men and women to accept and obey that which they already know. 
There are not many people of intelligence, in my opinion, who believe 
that the use of strong drink is good for the youth of the nation or that 



106 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



it will help us. What is needed is faith in the hearts of the people 
sufficiently strong to get them to accept the knowledge which they have 
and practice it, and to have confidence in the Lord. 

My heart is touched at times when poor people — and in the Northern 
States there are many at the present time — send in one dollar, and 'I 
know that is a full tithing for the month, and express in their letters 
to us that they have confidence in the Lord, that if they will keep his 
commandments and do their part, they are sure the Lord will do his part. 
It is the universal testimony of those who pay their tithing that the Lord 
will take care of them and those who have sufficient faith to do that are 
better off than those who do not. 

Tomorrow the missionaries of the Northern States Mission will 
be walking the streets of the cities, and they will hear, as they meet the 
people, about this wonderful concert to which we have listened this 
morning. This testimony of song and music, and the testimony of the 
Elders of the Church, and the testimony of the example of this people 
shall go forth to the world, and after that will come the testimony of 
earthquakes and the testimony of the raging tempests, as the Lord has 
said. 

My faith is stronger than it ever has been and I want to say that 
I support and sustain the Authorities of the Church, and I want to leave 
my testimony with you, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

A sacred selection, "Awake My Soul," was rendered by the Choir — 
duet by Cannon Lund and Bertha Sessions. 

Elder H. Melvin Rollins, President of the Lyman Stake, offered 
the closing prayer. 

Conference adjourned until 2 o'clock. 



THIRD DAY 



AFTERNOON MEETING 

The closing session of the Conference convened promptly at 2 
o'clock Sunday afternoon, April 9. Again the great Tabernacle was 
crowded to capacity, and thousands of people who could not get into 
the building gathered in the Assembly Hall and upon the Temple 
Square where they listened to the services by means of large amplifiers 
as the proceedings were broadcast from the Tabernacle. 

The Choir and congregation joined in singing the hymn, "The 
Spirit of God like a fire is burning." 

Elder Wilford A. Beesley, President of the Salt Lake Stake, of- 
fered the invocation. 

Mrs. Ray M. Russell sang a sacred solo, "Who are these arrayed 
in white?" 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

Since our last Conference one of the most beloved, most energetic 
and most estimable members of the General Authorities of the Church 
has passed away, a man whose voice has been heard here many many 
times and one who has filled several missions in Great Britain. Until 
shortly before his decease he had been presiding over the California 
Mission of the Church. During his administration several hundred 
thousands of dollars were expended in the erection of chapels in that 
mission, and three stakes were organized in what was the California 
Mission at the time that Brother Joseph W. McMurrin was made its 
president. He was one of the great preachers of the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ in these last days, a man with a perfect and abiding testimony 
of the divinity of the work in which we as Latter-day Saints are engaged ; 
a man who won the love and respect not only of members of the Church 
but of all with whom he came in contact, for his sincerity, his honesty 
and his fearless defense of the work of the Lord. 

ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

We are reassembled at the time and place appointed, and if we 
have come, as I feel that we have, with the spirit of righteous desire and 
faith in our hearts, we should receive a continuation of the blessings 
that have been so marked in the earlier sessions of this conference. 

TIMELINESS 

Time and timeliness are very important in the affairs of men, and 
no less in the ever unfolding purposes of the Lord our God. He does 
things in his own due time, and that is always the right time. In the 



108 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



establishment of this nation, of which we have heard much, he chose the 
time, after due preparation had been made. I believe that had an attempt 
been made by men to establish a democracy, such as this, a hundred or 
fifty or twenty years earlier, it would have been a failure. 

There is a time for seeding and there is a time for harvest. Many 
of us become impatient and desire to reap the harvests of the fields and 
the orchards even before the harvests of the snows have been garnered 
in the storage recesses of these everlasting hills. 

There was a time for the establishment of this Church. It was 
the Lord's time. Great and numerous events had been leading up to it, 
and at the appointed time it was established, never again to be thrown 
down. 

EXAMPLES OF TIMELINESS 

There is a marked timeliness in the advice and counsel and instruc- 
tions given to the Latter-day Saints from period to period. Many could 
not understand, or would not understand why, but a few years ago, 
during the epoch of recognized prosperity, the usual advice and counsel 
to the people in regard to things temporal was emphasized, perhaps 
more than ever before. People were told to get out of debt, and to keep 
out of debt, and not to go into expanding schemes whereby their means 
would be tied up. They were told of the very conditions that are now 
upon us. It is true that through all the decades past since the people 
came to these mountains, advice of this kind had been given ; but it was 
intensified in recent years, and those who had ears to hear listened and 
acted upon the counsel given. To others it was mere repetition, and 
they permitted it to pass. 

There was a time when our Elders were preaching among the na- 
tions of the earth the doctrine of the gathering, and urging upon the 
people, the members of the Church in those other countries, to make 
arrangements to come to Zion as soon as they could. That was when 
immigration into this country was unrestricted, and the Perpetual Emi- 
gration Fund was maintained for the assistance of worthy saints who 
were otherwise prepared to come to this land. They were told at that 
time — I heard the Elders of the Church declare it when I was a boy in 
my native land — that the day would come when it would not be possible 
for people to come to Zion, and they should take advantage of the 
opportunities that they then possessed. And so it is with many other 
developments. 

COUNSEL IN SEASON 

Now, at this conference there has been much emphasis laid upon the 
necessity of attention to personal health and the conditions that tend to 
conserve and insure health of body and mind. I can imagine that some 
who are deaf to the finer sounds of the Gospel, as declared by the Lord's 
representatives, may well say: "We have heard that before. We have 
heard too many sermons about the Word of Wisdom." There is 
significant meaning in the emphasis that has been given to this subject 



ELDER JAMES E. TALMAGE 



109 



at the current conference, and those of you who are receptive — and I 
trust most of you are — must know that there is a deep significance in 
the emphasis being laid upon that topic just now. 

Have you not read of the pestilences, including perhaps strange 
diseases, that are to sweep the earth? They are among the judgments 
that were foretold for these days. We had a taste of such back in 1918-19, 
when the great influenza carried, according to the established records, 
over sixteen millions of people to their graves. Now, all other things 
being equal, it is the healthy and the strong who are more likely to sur- 
vive under the assault of disease. 

Latter-day Saints, look to your bodies, look to your health, as you 
have been again and again advised to do ; and if disease and pestilence 
come let it not take you because of your blamable condition of ill health. 

We have heard of these ills — calamities we call them though they 
may be blessings to the race in disguise — that are characteristic of these 
days. They have been predicted, and some people are apt to place re- 
sponsibility if not blame for all these upon the Lord, and to envision him 
as a God of vengeance. He is a God of love, and it is necessary that 
some of these experiences shall come upon mankind, that they may be 
better prepared for what the Lord' has in store for them by way of 
blessing. 

FOREKNOWLEDGE NOT A DETERMINING CAUSE 

It is not fair to blame the Lord, even in thought, because he gives 
us warning of what is to come. It is most irrational and illogical so to 
do. He, with his omniscience, knows what is to come to individuals 
and nations, and he gives warnings. Many of us take that warning 
to be an expression of divine determination to punish and to afflict. Well, 
others besides the Lord are subjects of ill-directed blame sometimes. I 
have suffered from it. On one occasion I undertook to warn a merry 
party of intending picnickers not to set out on their jaunt, because a 
storm was coming, a violent storm. I had consulted the instruments 
that told of its coming. But they knew better and they went, and they 
came back in some fashion. I wish you could have seen them. But the 
tragical part of it was they blamed it all on me. 

Shall it be that because the storm is predicted we should believe 
that the foreknowledge so used is a determining cause? You know 
better. Let us be thankful for the warnings that the Lord has given and 
is giving, and prepare ourselves against the tempest. 

Oh, Latter-day Saints, we have to bear the conditions that have 
been foretold, and that are now being realized. Let us do it with faith 
and resignation, never faltering, knowing that the Lord will bring out 
all things well, for his word shall not fail, nor shall his purposes be turned 
aside. 

I am happy to be in harmony with the spirit of this conference, to 
find myself receptive to the advice that has been given. 

May the Lord's peace and support be with us now, henceforth and 
forever, I humbly pray, in his name. Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



ELDER ANTOINE R. IVINS 

Of the First Council of Seventy and President of the Mexican Mission 

My brethren and sisters, I am delighted with the privilege of 
adding my testimony to those which have already been given 
during this conference, although I should very gladly have sur- 
rendered my portion of the time to those who are perhaps more 
able to instruct you. 

As you know, I represent the Mexican Mission, and as such I 
bring you greetings from perhaps the largest branch of the house 
of Lehi, We had a pageant the other night, celebrating the dawn 
of the day of the sons of Lehi. We are laboring among those 
very people, and we bring you their greetings. 

The Mexican Mission feels to congratulate itself especially at 
this time, in that it has two new representatives, we might say, 
among the presiding authorities of the Church. We feel extremely 
fortunate in the selection of these two brethren to fill the vacancies 
that they now occupy, because we know that both of them are 
friendly to our people and to our mission. We pray that God will 
bless them, that they may measure up fully and completely to the 
responsibility that rests upon them. We bear them up, and will 
support them wholeheartedly and without reserve. 

The Mexican Mission is making some progress. We are not 
able, however, to report the same advancement that some of the 
other missions are able to do. Our numbers are few. We have 
not available the same excellent quality and quantity of part-time 
missionary service as the other missions are enjoying^ It seems to 
me that it is through this effort that they are making their best 
contacts at this time, and we miss that force very, very much. 

We have in our mission some of the best young men and young- 
women in the Church. We wish to assure the fathers and mothers of all 
of them that they are now well, happy, and working hard ; and if there 
are any others who have sons and daughters that they would like to get 
a wonderful experience, send them to us. We would like to have them 
now. It is the work of the Lord. There is no greater work in the world, 
and your sons and your daughters are interested in its advancement. 

I don't feel that I should stand here and talk a long while this after- 
noon, but I just want to add my testimony to those that have already 
been given, to say that we support and uphold the authorities of this 
Church. We are especially interested in the campaign that seems to 
have been initiated for the Word of Wisdom, the slogan, if we may call 
it such, of this conference. 

I can bear the same testimony that has been borne here already 
two or three times, that the observance of the Word of Wisdom is no 
detriment in the world. I have spent ten years of my life laboring with 
people who are not of our faith, almost all of whom are non-observers 
of the Word of Wisdom, but I found, without exception, that they 
expected me to observe the Word of Wisdom. They almost demanded 
it of me, and I was mighty glad to think that it was a habit with me. 



ELDER ANTOINE R. IVINS 



111 



I pray that the Lord will bless us ; that he will make our shoulders 
equal to the burdens that we have to bear ; that we may carry on this 
work in honor and in dignity before him; that eventually, in his own 
proper time, it may fulfil the purpose for which it was established in 
the earth. With these few words I give way, praying God's bless- 
ings upon us all, in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER JOSEPH F. MERRILL 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

Brethren and sisters : No doubt you have come to this 103rd annual 
Conference of the Church to hear the word of the Lord as it shall fall 
from the lips of his servants who shall address you. So far as I am 
concerned I assure you that I have but a single desire and that is to speak 
only as my brethren and the Lord shall approve. And so I have earnestly 
prayed that the Lord will direct me in what I shall say. 

SUCCESS THROUGH DIVINE LEADERSHIP 

This is the Lord's work — not man's. It will prosper only if he leads 
it. It cannot prosper if directed by the uninspired wisdom of men. This 
is a fact that we should keep clearly in mind. For it applies not only to 
the work of the Church in general and as a whole, but also to any part of 
the work and to individual efforts in the Church. I am, of course, only 
stating a fact that is well known in the Church, the recognition of which 
is the beginning of wisdom of the person who would serve acceptably 
in teaching the word of the Lord. 

AN ANALOGOUS SITUATION 

The current economic conditions still form a major topic of dis- 
cussion. Many members of the Church look to its leadership to show 
them "a way out." Is not the situation somewhat analogous to that 
which prevailed when Jesus lived among the Jews in Palestine? The 
Jews were looking for a Messiah. But they wanted a savior who should 
lead them out of political bondage and establish them as an independent 
nation strong enough to cope successfully in a test of arms with any 
other nation. Even some of the followers of Jesus hoped and expected 
that he would develop into such a leader. They were disappointed that 
he did not do> so and therefore saw their fond hopes blasted when he 
was lifted upon the cross. 'They failed to see in him the promised 
Messiah. 

So in this day I am very sure that the Lord through his servants, 
the Presidency of the Church, has already very clearly pointed a way out 
from our present difficulties. But it appears that even many members 
of the Church, and certainly the peoples of the world generally, have 
f ailed to see the Lord's plan of economic recovery as given in the inspired 
words of the First Presidency of this Church. In this day we are so 
accustomed to striking headlines in the announcement of even many 
unimportant things that we are wholly unprepared to see a way out of 



112 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



the universal gloom that is not announced with the blowing of trumpets 
or some other equivocal method. 

THROUGH HIS SERVANTS THE PROPHETS 

Yet the Lord has spoken on the subject of the depression through 
his servants the prophets. I solemnly testify to you that this is the truth. 
Do you ask when and where ? I readily answer that he spoke through 
the First Presidency of this Church in their Annual Greetings published 
in the Christmas edition of the Deseret News December 19th, 1931, and 
December 17th, 1932. The texts of these two greetings are somewhat 
similar and might be stated as follows : 

"Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest." 

After briefly describing the prevailing conditions the Greetings of 
last December contain the following words: 

"Looking forward with the gift of prophecy the Prophet Isaiah, more than 
2500 years ago said : 'It shall be, as with the people, so with the priest ; as with 
the servant, so with the master ; as with the maid, so with her mistress ; as with 
the buyer, so with the seller ; as with the lender, so with the borrower ; as with 
the giver of usury, so with the taker of usury from him. , " 

And the Greetings go on to say : 

"No one will deny that Isaiah foresaw existing conditions. He tells us in 
simple language the causes which have led up to this condition, in the following 
words : 'They have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the 
everlasting covenant.' " 

THE REMEDY 

The Greetings then continue: 

"The remedy which will bring relief from the present confused condition" — 
now listen Latter-day Saints and ye peoples of all the world — "the remedy which 
will bring relief from the present confused condition is clearly set forth in the 
words of God our Father, spoken through the Prophet Malachi as follows : 'Return 
unto me and I will return unto you, saith the Lord of Hosts. Bring all the) 
tithes into the storehouse that there may be meat in mine house and prove me now 
herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open the windows of heaven and 
pour you out a blessing, that there will not be room enough to receive it.' " 

And the Greetings of the First Presidency continue: 

"These are not our words, but the words of God our Father, spoken through 
his chosen prophets." 

HOPE FOR THE FUTURE 

And there are other similar words of God our Father spoken through 
his chosen prophets, the First Presidency of this Church. They are 
found in the Christmas Greetings published in December, 1931, and are 
in part as follows: 

"Notwithstanding the confusion which at present prevails in this world of 
ours, we have much to be thankful for, and can look confidently forward to a 
brighter and a happier day." 

These certainly are cheering words. And the beauty in them lies 



ELDER JOSEPH F. MERRILL 



113 



in the fact that they are divinely inspired and therefore absolutely true. 
Hence they are full of hope and comfort. 

FULFILMENT OF REQUIREMENTS NECESSARY 

But in this orderly world of ours nothing takes place without a 
cause. This is a truth taught by science and is familiar to all students 
of science. It is a truth that has also been taught to the Latter-day Saints 
since the early days of the Church. We find it recorded in Section 130 
of the Doctrine and Covenants and expressed in the language of the 
Prophet Joseph Smith as follows : 

"There is a law irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this 
world, upon which all blessings are predicated; and when we obtain any blessing 
from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated." 

Our God never promises any blessing either in his holy scriptures 
or through the mouths of his divinely inspired servants except con- 
ditionally ; that is, to obtain the blessings the necessary requirements must 
be satisfied. And so we would expect a relief from the present deplorable 
conditions to be based upon the fulfilment of certain requirements. What 
then are the requirements that enable us to "look confidently forward to 
a brighter and happier day ?" Listen, Oh Israel, listen "all ye that are 
heavy laden." Thus saith the Lord through his servants, the First 
Presidency : 

"If the people of the world will turn unto God, and acknowledge His Son 
our Redeemer ; if each citizen of our country will put away selfishness, strife and 
bitterness, * * * the clouds of adversity will roll away, the sun of prosperity will 
shine again, and peace and plenty will prevail from the rivers to the ends of the 
earth." 

THE LORD'S PLAN 

Here then we have stated in plain language how we may get out of 
this world-wide depression. The plan is simple: it is the Lord's plan. 
Many other plans have been proposed, some of them widely discussed. 
But none of them will completely succeed. Of this we may be certain 
for they are the plans of men and not of God, since they do not contain 
all the elements of God's plan. 

Now while God's plan is simple it may not be easy to execute. It 
is based upon the two great commandments — Love the Lord thy God 
with all thy might, mind and strength, and thy neighbor as thyself. To 
keep these commandments we must live the Golden Rule, never an easy 
thing to do. 

A CALL TO REPENTANCE 

Latter-day Saints, you have come, up to this conference to hear the 
word of the Lord. I have read it to you as the Lord has given it through 
his servants, the prophets. And now the question is, Are we ready to 
accept it ? To do so we must repent. And so the call of the Lord to his 
people is a call to repentance. To repent of what? Of our "selfishness, 
strife and bitterness." It is a call not only to me and to you but all the 
people who inhabit the earth. Peace and prosperity will not return unless 
we do repent. Let us not forget this fact. Men may plan and scheme 



114 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



and legislate but peace and plenty will never again smile upon all the 
inhabitants of this goodly land until we keep the commandments of Jesus 
Christ, the God of this land. Believing this with all my heart I cry 
repentance wherever I go among the people. It is the theme of all my 
talks in the congregations of the Saints. 

LAW GOVERNS THE UNIVERSE 

Does the Lord, our Father in Heaven, delight in the suffering and 
misery of his children, conditions everywhere prevalent in these dis- 
tressing times? Does any right-minded, kind-hearted earthly parent 
delight in the punishment of his child? Most certainly not. But our 
Heavenly Father is not only loving, kind and merciful. He is also just. 
He is the Creator of the world, of the universe, and of all things that 
in them are. But this world is an orderly world. Law governs all the 
phenomena of nature and of every existent thing. If we violate any of 
these laws, the laws of health for example, we may expect to suffer the 
consequences. The justice of God requires that we do so. We have a 
depression and are suffering the consequences because we have violated 
the laws of right social living. And these are God's laws. God has not 
become cruel and inflicted us with the bitter troubles from which we are 
suffering. We have made our own troubles. Let us recognize this truth, 
turn about and repent. Then the Lord will be delighted with us and we 
shall come to a happier and a brighter day. But repentance is the 
condition. 

We must turn "away from our selfishness, strife and bitterness." 
Why have we not paid our tithes and our fast offerings, as the Lord has 
commanded us? Is it not because of our selfishness? Can we really 
believe in the divinity of this work and then withhold our tithes from 
the store house of the Lord?! Can we expect to enjoy the favors of the 
Lord if we fail in fulfilling the conditions upon which his favors are 
based? If we do have such expectations we shall be disappointed, for 
our God is a law observer, a just God. 

THE SIN OF SELFISHNESS 

Of all our sins the sin of selfishness is one of the most common 
and one of the greatest. It saturates our entire life — social, business, 
political, even religious. One of the reasons why most man-made plans 
of economic recovery would fail miserably, even if attempted, is because 
they are characterized by selfishness — inordinate selfishness in many 
cases. Now, no plan, no matter by whom proposed, will succeed if it has 
this characteristic. God has so spoken. His word will not fail. 

AN OUTSTANDING EXAMPLE 

One of the most outstanding examples of inordinate current day 
selfishness is the propaganda for the repeal of the Eighteenth Amend- 
ment to the United States Constitution. During recent years millions 
of dollars have been spent furthering this propaganda. The arch-enemy 
of this amendment is the Association Against the 18th Amendment, an 
organization small in numbers, but powerful in influence because of the 



ELDER JOSEPH F. MERRILL 



115 



enormous sums of money it can command. More than fifty millionaires 
are reported to have membership in it. Many millions of dollars have 
been spent in its work. Why? Because if beer and other alcoholic 
beverages can be taxed and large revenues secured from this source, the 
rich will pay smaller income and corporation taxes. One rich man said 
the taxes on liquor would save one of his companies alone ten million 
dollars a year in corporation taxes. And his family have several large 
corporations. "Yes, let us have beer and repeal the 18th Amendment," 
cry the rich propagandists. "Why? Because this will shift huge taxes 
from our shoulders" to the backs of the working people of America, a 
fact that workers apparently have not yet recognized. 

Yes, I repeat, brazen selfishness is the chief motive back of most 
repeal propaganda. Against all such I lift my voice. I stand for the 
18th Amendment and against its repeal. Would that every member of 
the Church and every citizen stood with me. Does any one think the 
Lord will be pleased with us if by any act of ours we allow evil to come 
nearer to our doors ? 

In closing I again call to repentance and proclaim aloud, "that the 
coming of a brighter and a happier day" is dependent upon our living 
the Golden Rule and acknowledging Jesus Christ as our Savior. 

The Lord help us so to do I pray in the name of our Redeemer, 
Amen. 

ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS 

Of the First Council of Seventy 

Sometime about the middle of March I took note that the governor 
of this state issued a proclamation to the citizens thereof, appointing a 
day, the 12th of March, if I remember right, on which the churches of 
the state were asked to hold special services of a rather patriotic nature, 
giving voice and prayer to convictions and ideas that would be uplifting, 
to establish confidence in our nation, and to entreat the favor of God 
towards it. I think there was quite a general response to that proclama- 
tion, as indeed there ought to be to such proclamations, whether by the 
presidents of our country or the governors of our state, in such mat- 
ters as thanksgiving days, and if necessary, days of fasting and of 
seeking any special favors of God. 

It is peculiarly fitting that a people who profess, as an article of 
their faith: "We believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers 
and magistrates ; in obeying, honoring, and sustaining the law" — to 
such a people it is highly fitting that heed be given to the announcement 
made for reverence in our feelings and faith toward God. I visited some 
stakes in the Church, however, where circumstances, which I suppose 
were beyond control, did not admit of giving heed to this proclamation 
of our governor, a man in every way worthy of our confidence, and 
worthy of our confidence in his sincerity and his faith when making 
such a proclamation as the one I refer to — and I speak somewhat under- 
standing^, because I have known him from his boyhood, arid know the 
value and virtue of his life. 



116 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



I am wondering if just a word might not be spoken here, at this 
General Conference, that would be fitting and proper, to recall his procla- 
mation and the purpose of it, even though we may have to do so hurriedly. 
I think, perhaps, that would be as good a contribution as I could make 
to this conference session. Especially do I believe that because I think 
that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints occupies a. certain 
"pride of place" in connection with a knowledge of the terms upon which 
the prosperity and the redemption of this nation rest. 

I remember to have read in the Book of Mormon certain passages 
that bear upon this thought. We are told in that precious volume of 
scripture that when the floods receded from this land it became a very 
choice land unto the Lord, a land that, through this word of the Lord 
from the Nephite race, receives its most precious descriptive name. 
At any rate, this was the decree : "After the waters had receded from 
off the face of this land, it became a choice land above all other lands, 
a chosen land of the Lord ; wherefore the Lord would have that all men 
should serve him who dwell upon the face thereof." 

This is recorded in the Book of Ether, which Moroni translated 
and added to the compilation made by his father. And further it is 
said — and this information was first imparted unto the Nephites — as I 
remember it, Brother Ivins quoted part of it — that all those who should 
come to this land should be brought of the Lord ; that it was a choice 
land in which should be assembled those whom God would lead, by the 
inspiration of his Spirit, unto this land. This truth was especially made 
known unto the Jaredites, and stands as follows — that if they kept not 
the commandments of God they should be swept off when the fulness 
of his wrath should come upon them : 

"And now, we can behold the decrees of God concerning this land, that it is a 
land of promise ; and whatsoever nation shall possess it shall serve God, or they shall 
be swept off when the fulness of his wrath shall come upon themi. And the 
fulness of his wrath cometh upon them when they are ripened in iniquity. * * * 

"Wherefore he that doth possess it shall serve God or shall be swept off ; for 
it is the everlasting decree of God. * * * 

"And this cometh" — 

And this, by the way, is the comment of Moroni upon this fact which 
had been brought vividly before him from the Jaredite record. Now, 
he makes a very wonderful contribution in this comment: 

"And this cometh unto you, O ye Gentiles, that ye may know the decrees of 
God — that ye may repent, and not continue in your iniquities until the fulness come, 
that ye may not bring down the fulness of the wrath of God upon you as the in- 
habitants of the land have hitherto done." 

Now, of course, Moroni, in making this comment, had before him 
the vivid recollection of the destruction of the Jaredites to the last man, 
and he had before him also the destruction of the Nephites, with the 
exception of a few who had fled to the land southward. Hence these 
lessons, so vividly before him, warranted him in sounding this note of 
warning unto the great Gentile nation that was to occupy this choice 
land in the last days, the land choice above all other lands. 

"That ye may repent," he continues, "and not continue in your iniquities until 



ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS 117 



the fulness come, that ye may not bring down the fulness of the wrath of God 
upon you as the inhabitants of the land have hitherto done. 

"Behold, this is a choice land, and whatsoever nation shall possess it shall be 
free from bondage, and from captivity, and from all other nations under heaven, 
if they will but serve the God of the land, who is Jesus Christ, who hath been man- 
ifested by the things which we have written." 

Then again, there are two great prophecies in the Book of Mormon, 
and I think after the witness which the Book of Mormon bears to the 
divinity of the Christ, affirming that he is the Son of God, and after 
affirming that he is the Savior of the world, and after bearing witness 
to the truth of the Gospel — then I think that this new American 
witness for God has its next important item in the fact that it 
lays down these prophecies concerning the great Gentile nation 
that should rise and which would scatter the children of Israel upon 
the face of the land, and yet, afterwards, be touched by the spirit of pity 
and concern which would lead them to seek the preservation of the in- 
habitants of the land ; that the seed of Joseph, so wonderfully gathered 
here and developed into a multitude of nations, should not be utterly 
destroyed, but should be preserved, and that, too, by this great nation 
that should be such an instrument in scattering them in the earth. The 
promises of the Lord in respect to these things are very wonderful and 
make the Book of Mormon one of the most valuable books that has ever 
been preserved, even as holy scripture. 

This is said in regard to the above nation, which constitutes the first 
prophecy, namely : 

"Thou beholdest that the Gentiles who have gone forth out of captivity, and 
have been lifted up by the power of God above all other nations, upon the face of 
the land which is choice above all other lands, * * * thou seest that the Lord will 
not suffer that the Gentiles will utterly destroy the mixture of thy seed, which are 
among thy brethren." 

So there was this prediction. Now, of course, perhaps the world 
will not admit that this was a prophecy uttered some six hundred years 
before the coming of the Christ upon this land ; but it must be inevitably 
conceded that these words are prophetic, because they were uttered in 
1830, when the Book of Mormon was published. At that time, of course, 
the Gentile nation here under the government of the United States num- 
bered but about thirty millions ; and now, behold, the great Gentile 
nation has become so increased in numbers and in power that there are 
perhaps nearly a hundred and thirty millions that constitute the citizens 
of the United States. 

As for its power and dominion above all other nations of the earth, 
it has become somewhat customary to speak of America, but we gener- 
ally mean the United States of America. Some of the Latin American 
republics take exception to this assumption of supreme domination in 
the western world, and demur from such homage being given to the 
United States. But nevertheless it is a fact which exists, and the dom- 
inating political power, the master spirit and dominant power in a po- 
litical way, is this Anglo-Saxon republic known as the United States 
of America. 



118 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



That nation alone was competent to state the great Monroe Doc- 
trine, to the effect that these continents were closed to the establishment 
of the political systems of Europe, and they could not attempt to intro- 
duce such systems as theirs in this country, without giving offense to 
the United States of America ; and behind the utterance was the neces- 
sary force to maintain such a declaration; it was inherent in the great 
Anglo-Saxon republic of this country. 

The above is one prediction of the rise of a great nation that should 
be the greatest nation upon the face of this choice land. But that is 
only part of the prophecy. During the time that Jesus Christ visited 
this promised land he gave an utterance in regard to this matter that is 
extremely important. I want to read to you his words, the choicest 
words that can be spoken in relation to the land, and which join in the 
music from the inspiration of God, under which these, my brethren, 
have been speaking to you, in relation to the deliverance from distressing 
problems and disastrous circumstances into which we have been plunged. 
The Christ makes this declaration — the resurrected Christ, while min- 
istering among the Nephites : 

"And thus comtnandeth the Father that I should say unto you : At that day 
when the Gentiles shall sin against my gospel, and shall be lifted up in the pride 
of their hearts above all nations, and above all the people of the whole earth, and 
shall be filled"— 

and I ask you to note especially this list of American sins — 

" — shall be filled with all manner of lyings, and of deceits, and of mischiefs, 
and all manner of hypocrisy, and murders, and priestcrafts, and whoredoms, and of 
secret abominations; and if they shall do all those things, and shall reject the 
fulness of my gospel, behold, saith the Father, I will bring the fulness of my 
gospel from among them." 

I think possibly it could be held as true that they did that when the 
members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints were ex- 
patriated from Illinois and finally from the United States itself, and 
had to come to this high mountain valley, then the territory of the re- 
public of Mexico. But mark this : 

"And then I will remember my covenant which I have made unto my people, 
O house of Israel, and I will bring my gospel unto them : 

"And I will show unto thee, O house of Israel, that the Gentiles shall not have 
power over you ; but I will remember my covenant unto you O, house of Israel, and 
ye shall come unto the knowledge of the fulness of my gospel." 

"But IF" — I wish to emphasize this — "But IF the Gentiles will repent and 
return unto me, saith the Father, behold they shall be numbered among my people, 
O house of Israel. 

"And I will not suffer my people, who are of the house of Israel, to go through 
among them, and tread them down, saith the Father. 

"But IF they will not turn unto me, and hearken unto my voice, I will suffer 
them, yea, I will suffer my people, O house of Israel, that they shall go through 
among them, and shall tread them down, and they shall be as salt that hath 
lost its savor." 

There is not time for me to dwell more at large upon these things, 
but I think I have before you now the word of the Lord sufficiently to 



ELDER BRIGHAM H. ROBERTS 119 



cooperate with the declaration that has been made here, that though 
the great Gentile nation shall commit that long list of very serious and 
grievous sins, still if they will repent they shall have lot and part with 
the people of the Lord in building up Zion and accomplishing the pur- 
poses of the Lord. That is the great truth that I wish to emphasize in 
my remarks, and that we may have hope, under these teachings of the 
Son of God, for the great Gentile nation upon this land. 

I believe that it is our duty and responsibility to sound this note of 
warning, and point out the way of escape : that if the nation that inhabits 
this land will hold its place by adhering to the things of God, and by 
doing his will and honoring the God of the land, who is Jesus Christ, the 
nation can be preserved. The scriptures definitely say so. 

Now, I ask myself of late: How far is the great Gentile nation hon- 
oring the God of the land ? Well, there is much in their favor in that 
respect. I look down the line of that splendid list of men who have 
been the presidents of the United States, and the most of them may have 
claim upon faith in Christ, faith in the Christian religion. They may 
not have been devoted as partisans to this church or to that church, 
but they have had broad-minded views and have felt the necessity of 
honoring the God of this land in their faith and in their actions. 

While listening to the inauguration-day proceedings of our present 
President of the United States, I felt a thrill of happiness go through 
me when I found him, on his way to pick up President Hoover to go 
to the inaugural ceremonies, stopping to visit his church, to approach its 
altar and remember God in prayer. 

I was happy when I heard the proceedings in the House of Repre- 
sentatives, and found that a prayer — and I believe an earnest, Christian 
prayer — was offered up in the House of Representatives and in the 
Senate. And I was still happier when I heard the President, in his 
inaugural address, admonish the people to have faith in God and to trust 
in him, and pray that the people might be guided by the inspiration of 
the Lord ; and especially when he said, near the close of his remarks, that 
he prayed that "God would guide him in the days to come." 

Now, all these circumstances are hopeful. There is still faith in this 
great people that God has raised up upon this land to direct in the civil 
affairs of men. I think sometimes when I read those great words in the 
Declaration of Independence, that governments derive their just powers 
from the consent of the governed, that truly and really the law of the 
Lord is going forth from Zion as the word of the Lord — even the word 
of him that is the Word that was in the beginning with God, and 
that was God, and that was made flesh and dwelt among men, where 
men could behold his grace and his power, the Lord Jesus Christ — 
went forth from Jerusalem. 

My brethren and sisters, I think we have reason to hope for our 
nation. I believe the testimony of President Ivins to be true, that we 
have a God-established government here, and also under its protecting 
aegis we have the Church of Jesus Christ established in the fulness of 
time, for the last time, to bring to pass the purposes of God in the sal- 
vation of men. 



120 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



I see a beautiful unity in these things found in the Book of Mormon 
and the testimonies to which we have listened during this conference. 
I think we have the right to lift up the drooping hand, and to speak the 
word of encouragement to' the people of the United States, and chiefly 
for this reason, that neither the government of the United States, in 
its achievements and in its character of great leadership, nor the Church, 
has yet reached the climax of those things for which they were estab- 
lished. So my faith is that we have a right to expect recovery and re- 
newal of faith with God, and fellowship with him ; for we still bow the 
knee and still proclaim that Jesus is the Christ, the God of this land 
and of all the earth. And as long as that is our national attitude, I be- 
lieve that the light of hope is not obliterated. 

I pray God to bless the nation, to bless the Church, and all that 
pertains to it, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. 

PRESIDENT HE.BER J. GRANT 

I feel that we owe a very deep debt of gratitude to Evan Stephens, 
George Careless, Joseph J. Daynes, Ebenezer Beesley and others who 
have written beautiful music for us. I am free to confess that when I 
go out into the country districts and hear sung certain anthems, I wonder 
why the people do not show preference for the home-made article. I 
think that Evan Stephens and these other men were inspired of the 
Lord to write music for us. I do not want to reflect on any of the mag- 
nificent things that have been written by others, but I have gone to many 
a conference where I have listened to anthems when I would rather 
have heard a good Latter-day Saint hymn sung. 

An anthem, "Grant us Peace," was sung by the Choir. 

ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 

Of the First Council of Seventy 

My brethren and sisters : As I have sat On the stand here and looked 
into your faces, the past day or two, I have been built up in spirit and 
in truth. I realize the fineness and the honesty of the brethren who 
hold the priesthood of God. 

This is a time of much trial and sorrow. The greatest need today 
is that human hearts shall find comfort, and I believe you have found 
comfort in coming up to this holy tabernacle of God, where one hears 
the word of God. Men need encouragement ; they need divine light 
and understanding. They need to see those "divine truths that come 
of the Eternal Father in the name of Christ," as a prophet of old once 
said. And this American prophet further said : 

"If ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, 
he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost. 
"And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things." 

Do we believe and understand these divine words? Jesus once 
said : "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God." Do we 



ELDER LEVI EDGAR YOUNG 



121 



see? Are we opening our hearts to the truth that life has a meaning, 
and a meaning for good? Are we learning obedience by the things 
we suffer? If so, you and I are bending to the will of God, and coming 
through the strife unto greater faith and unto peace. 

This is a day of sore trial for all the inhabitants of the earth. Na- 
tions are tottering and governments are in danger of being overthrown. 
Hardly a day passes but what we hear of some terrible catastrophe or 
some awful tribulation that has come to the children of men. "Dark- 
ness covers the earth, and gross darkness the people." We are being 
disciplined; and when we come to know the wisdom of this, we will 
look upon the whole of life as a means of sanctification. 

One time when Israel was sore tried, her homes destroyed, her 
children starved, her people driven into the wilderness, one of her 
prophets wrote : 

"Comfort ye, comfort ye, my people, saith your God. * * * 
"Behold, the Lord God will come with strong hand, and his arm shall rule for 
him. * * * He shall feed his flock like a shepherd : he shall gather the lambs with 
his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and shall gently lead those that are with 
young. * * * 

"But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength ; they shall mount 
with wings as eagles ; they shall run, and not be weary ; they shall walk, and not 
faint;" 

I sincerely believe that these days are bringing us closer and closer 
to God. We have prayed in our hearts ; and we have come up to this 
conference with joy. Therefore, may we abide in the thought and the 
words of the psalmist of ancient Israel: "Lord, who shall abide in thy 
tabernacle ? Who shall dwell in thy holy hill ?" And the answer was : 
"He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh 
the truth in his heart." 

My brethren and sisters, we need not fear ; we need not be afraid 
to live, and to look up with ever increasing faith. 

"Behold, the Lord God will come with strong hand, and his arm shall rule 
for him. * * * He shall feed his flock like a shepherd ; he shall gather the lambs 
with his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and shall gently lead those that are with 
young. * * * But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they 
shall mount with wings as eagles ; they shall run and not be weary ; they shall 
walk and not faint. 

"And so what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly; and to love 
mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God." 

May we become the pure in heart and see God, I ask in Jesus' name. 
Amen. 

PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I hold in my hand a book entitled, "In Search of Truth," written 
by the only absentee of the General Authorities of the Church, Elder 
John A. Widtsoe, of the Council of the Twelve. I had marked enough 
passages in the book to occupy fully twenty minutes of your time were 
I to read them, but there are not twenty minutes left unless we eliminate 
Brother Ballard entirely, and I am willing to divide evenly with him. 



122 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



I am going to read the last chapter of this book. I think I can do 
it readily in ten minutes : 

THE WAY TO TRUTH 

The way to truth? O yes, there is such a royal road, and any man may find 
and follow it. True, it leads straight for the goal and therefore is not attractive 
to those who like to meander and loiter among pretty fields of pseudo-truth. But 
those who have trodden the royal way, and their names are legion, bear witness to 
the surpassing joy of the journey. 

Desire. 

The way to truth may be found by anyone who desires it. But, he must desire 
it with all his might, mind and strength. A Sunday wish will not suffice. The 
desire must suffuse and penetrate every waking moment. One's whole being must 
reach out for truth, a fragment of which must become more precious than the 
whole scintillating world of untruth. Life itself must seem a small price to pay 
for the possession of truth. 

Such a desire leads one inevitably to the gateway of truth. The great ones- 
of all ages, prophets, poets, philosophers, and scientists, who have moved the world 
forward, have been vibrating lovers of truth. They have not found this gem 
of gems accidentally, but it has been revealed to them as the result of their earnest 
struggle. They set out with the power of desire in their souls, and victory was 
assured. To such, truth cannot be denied. It comes to them with a "great wakening 
light,' 1 ' as servant and friend. Modern science has revealed that wherever the 
searcher goes truth is found. The prophet Alma has formulated the thought, "He 
granteth unto men according to their desire." 

Many a mighty but stubborn soul has haunted the moorlands of life because it 
refused to yield itself to the desire for truth rather than to its own wilfulness. 
Many a simple but fervent soul, asking for truth above all else, has won the kin- 
ship of happy understanding among the restless multitude. Love of truth cannot 
thrive with an undisciplined will. Therefore the will for truth leads man farther 
than the possession of powerful physical or intellectual strength. There is no 
real desire for truth unless the individual is ready to lay by, if needs be, his 
former conceptions, in favor of the greater truth that he has found. The un- 
believer usually comforts himself with the assurance that his analytical powers 
will lead him to truth, and forgets that the first requisite is a consuming desire to 
know things as they really are. 

Prayer. 

Truth is unlimited : that is the clarion cry of science and of religion. The 
search for truth is a process of discovering the unknown, of throwing light into 
dark places. The searcher interprets the language of life and reads the will of 
God. And he is able to do so because he is in tune or communion with the truth he 
seeks. He must believe that it is there; he must seek, as it were, to touch it and to 
be led by it. Such attempts to be in harmony with truth is prayer. 

Men who search out truth are prayerful. They stand with uncovered heads 
before the unknown. They know their own insignificance before the eternal fount 
of knowledge. Certainly, there are some truth-seekers, usually busy in material 
fields, who do not speak to the Lord directly, but they also stand reverently before 
the power in all things, which is their conception of God. Prayer, as commonly 
understood, or its equivalent, is a requisite for those who are to travel the way to 
truth. _ Manly men who really love truth, are proud to pray to God for help 
and guidance. They get down on their knees. Prayer and desire go hand in hand. 
Desire says, Let us go, and prayer answers, Here is the way. Desire is the deter- 
mination to build the house; prayer is the planning and making ready for it. 
Desire is the gasoline in the engine, prayer the ignition that permits work to be 
done. On the way to truth, prayer must be as a constant jubilant cry of the 
traveler. 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 



123 



To win knowledge of the unseen, to obtain a testimony of truth, one must pray 
without ceasing. It must be the first and last act of the day. Then we shall be 
in tune and harmony with the forces about us, and truth will wait upon us and 
we shall recognize it. The need of prayer grows with the increase of truth. 

Study. 

The third step towards the way to truth is to bend actively every power to the 
elucidation of truth. The scientist with strong desire for the discovery of truth, 
and a prayer in his heart that he may be attuned to it, and thereby be able to recog- 
nize it, sets out to learn all that is known about the subject, and then he experi- 
ments, records and analyzes, until at last the new discovery comes into view. It 
is often strenuous labor. Amundsen who saw both Poles and traveled the north- 
west passage, had a burning desire for exploration, and placed himself in full 
harmony with the spirit of discovery ; then he informed himself as few men have 
done about the history of exploration, ocean currents, magnetic disturbance, 
meteorology, navigation, shipbuilding, and numerous other things required in his 
coming labors. It was upon such a preparation that he built his immortal career. 
Such earnest study is required of all who achieve truth. 

The field of religion offers no exception. To understand religious truth it 
must be studied. The Gospel of Jesus Christ comprehends all other knowledge. 
It is the philosophy that explains the whole of man's relationship to the universe. 
It invites the deepest study and the severest scrutiny. In religion as in science the 
more a subject is studied, the more perfect is our knowledge of it. Our certainty 
of the truth of a subject does not necessarily depend upon our extent of knowledge, 
but comprehensiveness of understanding unquestionably increases as knowledge 
grows. 

Failure to become acquainted with a subject through careful study has led to 
many a disaster, especially in the spiritual field. Men who have spent years of 
study to perfect themselves in a science, and only weeks in the systematic con- 
sideration of religion, often set themselves up with splendid indifference to con- 
sistency as equally competent in both fields. Religion demands studious attention 
if it is to be understood. It is well to ask the blatant unbeliever something about 
the serious study he has given the subject. 

It scarcely needs to be said that each person must find the way to truth for 
himself. Another man cannot desire for us or pray in our stead, or study in our 
place. That can be done neither in science nor religion. The help received from 
another is proportional to our own effort. 

The recognition of this principle is found in the restored church of Christ, in 
which the priesthood is held by all worthy men, and all members participate in 
church activities. In the progress towards truth every traveler must walk upon 
his own feet. Study of the principles of truth is therefore required of all. 

Practice. 

Truth is not fully established until it is put to the test of practice ; that is, truth 
must be obeyed to be fully known. This is an elementary principle of scientific 
thought, but for some inexplicable reason, in the field of religion it has seemed 
less important. 

Yet, use gives life to knowledge ; it converts theory into certainty ; it is the con- 
vincing seal of testimony. Practice or obedience is the final step towards the way 
to truth. 

This is the most difficult requirement made of the truth-seeker. After he has 
become intellectually convinced of the truth of a principle, he must practice it to 
establish its final certainty. A smoker who becomes convinced of the divine truth 
of the Word of Wisdom must forego the use of tobacco; or if convinced of the 
correctness of the principle of tithing, he must divide with the Lord; that means 
a battle with carnal desires. But a fulness of knowledge concerning the principles 
of truth comes only from obedience to them. 

The strength of desire and the sincerity of prayer for truth are here given the 



124 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



acid test. Learning the law may be a pleasant pastime, but obedience to law 
requires yielding of the will, which demands the assistance of flaming desire and 
intense prayer. When the man of knowledge stops short of practice, his desire for 
truth is weak. Many of the critics and fault-finders of systems of truth are in just 
such a condition. They know or fear that a principle is true, but have not the 
courage to try it out. Thousands of thinking people know that "Mormonism" is 
true, but they dare not practice its tenets and yield obedience to its requirements. 
Such people have no right to set themselves up as guides to others; they would 
better devote themselves to the subjection of their wills to the call of truth. And, 
by a curious token, study and. practice nourish desire and give direction to prayer, 
and thus strengthen the will. 

A Testimony. 

The way to truth ? Yes, it may be found easily, but only by paying the eternal 
price of truth. The way is through the higher logic, the convincing teaching of 
the spirit of truth by the operations of the mind and the eager outreaching of the 
spirit of God. 

Whoever would find truth must : 

(1) Desire truth, 

(2) Pray for it, 

(3) Study, and 

(4) Practice it. 

Those who do so will find truth, for it cannot be denied them. They will 
receive the glorious and priceless possession called a testimony or complete assur- 
ance of truth, which becomes the great gift of God to its possessor. 

Is truth worth the effort necessary to secure it? 

Truth is the only enduring possession of man; the only power that lifts man 
into permanent joy. It is the final justification of life. Human days are valueless 
if truth is not worth every sacrifice of life. Those who have lived most have lived 
by truth. So speaks the voice of human experience. 

I have read from the book, "In Search of Truth," because I desire 
that Elder John A. Widtsoe, the only absentee of the General Authorities 
of the Church and the President of the European Mission, be repre- 
sented in our Conference Pamphlet. 

God bless you all, Amen. 

ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 

Of the Council of the Twelve Apostles 

I desire, my brethren and sisters, to read two short extracts from 
a revelation of the Lord, given one hundred years ago to the Church. 
The first is from the eighty-sixth section : 

"Therefore, thus saith the Lord unto you, with whom the priesthood hath 
continued through the lineage of your fathers — 

"For ye are lawful heirs, according to the flesh, and have been hid from the 
world with Christ in God — 

"Therefore your life and the priesthood have remained, and must needs 
remain through you and your lineage until the restoration of all things spoken 
by the mouths of all the holy prophets since the world began. 

"Therefore, blessed are ye if ye continue in my goodness, a light unto the 
Gentiles, and through this priesthood, a savior unto my people Israel. The Lord 
hath said it." 

The other is from the one hundred fifteenth section, an address of 
the Lord Jesus Christ to the Church : 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 



125 



"Verily I say unto you all : Arise and shine forth, that thy light may be a 
standard for the nations; 

"And that the gathering together upon the land of Zion, and upon her stakes, 
may be for a defence, and for a refuge from the storm, and from wrath when it 
shall be poured out without mixture upon the whole earth." 

THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF GROWTH 

We were all made glad, a few weeks ago, to learn from President 
Hoover's Social Welfare Committee, which had been studying the social 
trends of the United States, that covering a period of some twenty-seven 
years this Church has made the greatest progress of any church in 
America, with a growth of 290 per cent. There is not another one that 
approaches us. We are glad for that, and particularly to know that this 
is taking place in the age of the world's greatest enlightenment. But 
we are more interested in the quality of men and women this Church has 
produced than in the numbers. Numbers have never meant very much 
in the past, and they may not mean much in the future, but quality is 
everything. 

A NEW DAY 

We are approaching, in my humble judgment, a new day in the 
history of the Church. I thought of it some few months ago while 
going through the Northern States Mission. I had the first opportunity 
in my life of visiting Kirtland, the first city the Latter-day Saints built. 
As we went through the wonderful temple where the marvelous mani- 
festations were made to Joseph, in the visit of those holy messengers who 
delivered to him divine keys of authority, I thought of the things that 
had occurred in the hundred years that had passed, and saw ever an 
objective before the Church — the struggle to maintain themselves, to find 
new homes, the flight across the plains, the battle with the wilderness 
here, eking out an existence, fighting our common enemies. There was 
always something before us that seemed to center our attention, worthy 
of every effort. 

And now we have reached, I say, a new day, in my judgment. 
Having been through the days of immigration and migration, and of 
struggle to maintain ourselves, having won at least the right to exist, 
we have reached the day of demonstration, when indeed, in the language 
of this revelation, we are to arise and shine and show forth a standard, 
a pattern to the world, a world that has been humbled. A world that was 
proud and haughty, finding itself almost independent of God, has been 
brought to its knees, so to speak. 

OUR TIME OF OPPORTUNITY 

In my own experience in traveling about in various sections of 
this country, recently I have noticed a disposition to listen as neiver 
before to any one who has any light, any inspiration or any help. Truly 
we have reached the time when the wisdom of the wise has perished, 
and the understanding of the prudent is hid. God designed that this 
Church should not be ignored, neither set in a corner, but he has shaped 
and fashioned the destinies of the world until they will be brought to 
receive his message. He is now looking to the Latter-day Saints to show 



GENERAL CONFERENCE 



by their lives, by their conduct, that there is power and strength in the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ to meet and to solve every problem. 

For the first time in the history of this world, the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ has an opportunity. I recognize that Christianity had many 
virtues, many of the teachings of Christ that influenced their lives ; but 
as the Lord himself declared to Joseph Smith a hundred years ago, they 
had the form of religion but not the power thereof. They were helpless 
to meet and cope with these conditions. 

The true Gospel of Jesus Christ has never been tested. It is now 
receiving its opportunity, and a world that is willing to listen, through 
the very circumstances through which we have passed, will be willing 
to pay heed and attention as never before, not only to what we say — 
that is not the important thing, for the most powerful sermons we 
have ever preached are the sermons of our lives. 

AN ENSIGN TO THE WORLD 

So as we listened to the address of our President, who made an 
appeal to the Latter-day Saints to live up to these high Gospel standards 
as contained in the Word of Wisdom, in my heart I said : "Oh, if the 
youth of the Church could catch the vision the Lord had in giving this 
revelation, and not merely want to yield obedience to what the President 
of the Church requires of them in order to be obedient to him, but get a 
vision of it !" It is the place the Lord has for them. What is that place? 
To set a pattern, to be an ensign, character builders who will attract the 
attention of the world if we will only live up to these standards. 

In listening to the address that he made — an appeal f or honesty — I 
said in my heart: "Oh, that the Latter-day Saints could still adhere to 
the standards of their fathers, when they made all with whom they came 
in contact acknowledge that a Mormon's word was as good as his bond !" 

My brethren and sisters, in this time of trouble and strife, when 
men and women are being swept off their feet and are in many instances 
taking the law into their own hands, here is an opportunity for Latter-day 
Saints to show their superior quality in their willingness to honor and 
obey and sustain the law and let it take its course, and not becomle 
bolshevik ourselves. Shall we cry and become rebellious ? 

THE COURAGE OF OUR FATHERS 

I thought of it while in Kirtland. What a sacrifice it must have 
meant to those brethren to leave that wonderful temple, wonderful even 
today, their homes, their all ! But did they quit and cry about it ? No. 
They went across the country to Independence, started to build again. 
Driven from Independence, in the central part of Missouri, they started 
to lay the foundation of another temple over in Nauvoo, where they 
had accomplished wonders in the building of a city of some twenty 
thousand people. Twenty thousand people in Nauvoo when Chicago, 
which this year is celebrating its hundredth anniversary, was a village 
of 4,620 souls. Yet they had to leave it all. Stripped and peeled, they 
crossed the great deserts and came into these mountains. Were they 
quitters? No. Though everything was taken from them, there was 



ELDER MELVIN J. BALLARD 



127 



in them the strength and courage to meet disaster after disaster. They 
stood like beaten anvils, with their f aith unbroken. 

VIRILITY AND STRENGTH IN THE GOSPEL 

Shall we, their children, show the white feather now? Suppose 
through our own mistakes we have lost some of our property, some of 
the advantages, that we thought we had, some of our money, shall we 
become sour and bitter, and rail against the providences of God? Or 
shall we, like our fathers, profit by our mistakes and build again, even 
though we lost it all ? I believe we will rise to the occasion. We are at 
a time when we are going to demonstrate to the world the virility, the 
power and the strength that are in the real Gospel of Jesus Christ, to 
meet and solve all these problems no matter what they are. 

IN SUPPORT OF THE CONSTITUTION 

I believe that it is the destiny of the Latter-day Saints to support 
the Constitution of the United States. The Prophet Joseph Smith is 
alleged to have said — and I believe he did say it — that the day would come 
when the Constitution would hang as by a thread. But he saw that the 
thread did not break, thank the Lord, and that the Latter-day Saints 
would become a balance of power, with others, to preserve that Con- 
stitution. If there is — and there is one part of the Constitution hanging 
as by a thread today — where do the Latter-day Saints belong? Their 
place is to rally to the support of that Constitution, and maintain it and 
defend it and support it by their lives and by their vote. Let us not 
disappoint God nor his prophet. Our place is fixed. 

A BETTER DAY 

Now, brethren and sisters, we have been three years getting down 
into the bottom — if we are at the bottom — of this depression. Have 
we patience to work on out? Suppose it takes three years longer to 
get out of it, are you willing to be patient that long ? I believe you are. 
Though it may take that length of time, if there shall come to us hope 
and faith and courage we can work out, and we shall. We are in the 
birth pangs of a glorious day. God's purposes are going forward in the 
earth. Everything is working towards a better day. There is hope 
ahead, and especially for the Latter-day Saints. 

God bless you, my brethren and sisters. Let us carry home 
with us the spirit of this conference, that we may renew our faith, and 
with courage dispel pessimism, increase optimism, and look to our glorious 
opportunity to arise and shine in a practical way, in the payment of our 
tithes. Yes, I promise you, in the name of the Lord, that if you will do 
these things that you have been asked to do at this conference — keep 
the Word of Wisdom, pay your tithes and offerings now, in a time when 
it will be hard for some of you to pay your tithing — I promise you de- 
liverance, for the secret of succeeding comes from doing the right thing 
at the right time and in the right way, and God will show you the way. 
He will never desert you if you do not desert him. 

God help us to be true to him, I pray, in the name of Jesus Christ, 
Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



PRESIDENT HEBER J. GRANT 

I wish to say to the Latter-day Saints at the close of this Con- 
ference that I am very happy, as I said at the beginning, to be here, and 
I have enjoyed it from start to finish, as I am sure all of you have. 

I am grateful to the Lord for the words of congratulation that have 
come to me from every person that has spoken to me regarding the choice 
of Brother J. Reuben Clark, Jr., and Brother Samuel O. Bennion. They 
have my unbounded love and confidence, and have earned the distinction 
that has come to them. 

May God bless us one and all. May his blessings attend every person 
holding a place of responsibility. May he bless our Choir members, and 
all who have taken part in preaching, praying, and singing the songs of 
Zion, is my humble prayer, and I ask it in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

"The Lord now victorious," a sacred anthem, was sung by the Choir. 
Elder Wayne H. Redd, President of the San Juan Stake, pronounced 
the benediction. 

Conference adjourned for six months. 



Professor Anthony C. Lund conducted the singing of the Choir and 
congregation at the Conference meetings. Accompaniments and inter- 
ludes on the great organ were played by Edward P. Kimball and Frank 
W. Asper. 

Stenographic notes of the Conference were taken by Frank W. 
Otterstrom and Joseph Anderson. 

Joseph Anderson, 

Clerk of the Conference.

THE FALLING AWAY 

By B. H. ROBERTS 

This new work is a ringing challenge to Christendom and a frank 
indictment of the multifarious creeds that are an outgrowth of the dis- 
integrated Apostolic Church. It shows most conclusively and brilliant- 
ly that all the churches had departed from the true pattern of Christ 
and lost the authority completely, long before the New Dispensation 
was ushered in through the instrumentality of Joseph Smith. 

Yet the motive of the author is not to tear down, but rather to 
build up; had there been no "falling away," the claim of the prophet 
of the New Dispensation would have been an imposture; if there was a 
"falling away," however, his claim is credible. It was to establish this 
fact sharply and conclusively that these radio addresses were given 
All who heard Elder Roberts or who will read these published dis- 
courses, will agree that he has accomplished the end in a scholarly and 
convincing manner. 

Though most of the discourses deal with eras of apostasy and 
centuries of discord, the ultimate message of the book is one of hope 
and salvation for the world. The three discourses on the Restoration 
read like the happy outcome of an otherwise tragic story. You feel at 
the end that the author has performed a necessary but melancholy 
task, only that he might invest with true meaning the unique claim of 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 

The Appendix of the new work is an answer to Catholic charges 
that the author had been unfair in his use of evidence and presentation 
of historic facts. His reply is given with enough zestful detail to 
leave the reader without a single doubt.

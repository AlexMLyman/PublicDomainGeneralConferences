OPENING ADDRESS. 

Brethren and sisters and friends: 
There are many reflections that arise 
in my mind as I behold the faces of so 
many Latter-day Saints here this 
morning. Sixty-nine years ago the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints was organized. How many 
strange scenes have been witnessed 
and what wonderful things have been 
acomplished by the Latter-day Saints 
since the organization! Prophets 
and Elders have been martyred while 
defending the great cause which God 
established in the interersts of the sal- 
vation, exaltation and glory of His 
children whom He has sent upon the 
earth. 

This is a lovely morning. All na- 
ture seems to smile upon us. I would 
like to ask my brethren and sisters, 
how do you feel? Do we all feel to 
rejoice in our hearts and to be happy? 
In view of what has been accomplished, 
do we feel grateful to our Heavenly 
Father? Think of the persecutions 
through which the Saints have passed

and the sacrifices we have made from 
time to time, and yet we are here this 
morning: surrounded by pleasant con- 
ditions. Then, what are the glorious 
prospects before us? After a few 
years, whatever may have been our ex- 
perience, we shall stand in the pres- 
ence of our Father in the future life, 
having accomplished His purposes 
while in the world, having- made sacri- 
fices in fulfilling that which the Lord 
has required at our hands from time 
to time, and we shall look back upon 
the past with joy and satisfaction. 
How happy we ought to be under 
present circumstances, in view of what 
we have done since we received the 
Gospel, and how we have been sus- 
tained, while some upon our right hand 
and upon our left have fallen 
into a state of apostasy. Contemplat- 
ing the past and glorious prospects 
of the future, our hearts ought to be 
filled with joy and thanksgiving to our 
God this day. 

We wish to have a good Conference, 
and we will. Just in proportion as we 
exercise our faith during the progress 
of this Conference, so will the blessings 
of the Almighty rest upon us; and as 
the speakers address us from day to 
day we will secure that which will be 
of vast importance to us. It is not 
always the lengthy discourse that af- 
fords to the Latter-day Saints that 
which is the most profitable; but in the 
various discourses delivered we may 
gather some idea, or some principle 
may flash upon our understanding 
which will prove valuable to us after- 
wards. Our blessings and our success 
in the past have been in proportion to 
our efforts and the exercise of our 
faith. When we contemplate what the 
Lord has done for us in the past, our 
present surroundings, and our future 
prospects, what a blest people we are! 
I have thought sometimes that one of 
the greatest virtues the Latter-day 
Saints could possess is gratitude to our 
Heavenly Father for that which He has 
bestowed upon us and the path over 
which He has led us. It may be that 
walking along in that path has not al- 
ways been of the most pleasant charac- 
ter; but we have afterwards discovered 
that those circumstances which have 
been very unpleasant have often proved 
of the highest advantage to us. We 



should always be pleased with the cir- 
cumstances that surround us and that 
which the Lord requires at our hands. 

Brethren and sisters, in the name of 
the Lord I bless you this morning. Let 
us be faithful and keep the command- 
ments of God. Let us never allow our 
prospects to become dimmed; let them 
be fresh before us by day and by night, 
and I will assure you that if we 
will do this our growth from day to day 
and from year to year will be marvel- 
ous. We can look back now and we 
can see that we have advanced. We 
have not stood still, but we have been 
moving along and gradually increasing 
our growth. The child grows from 
childhood to boyhood, and from boy- 
hood to manhood, with a constant and 
steady growth; but he cannot tell how 
or when the growth occurs. He doe? 
not realize that he is growing; but bjr 
observing the laws of health and being 
prudent in his course he eventually ar- 
rives at manhood. So in reference to 
ourselves as Latter-day Saints. We 
grow and increase. We are not aware 
of it at the moment; but after a year or 
so we discover that we are, so to speak, 
away up the hill, nearing the mountain 
top. We feel that we have faith in the 
Lord; that His providences are always 
beneficial; that we are connected with 
Him; that He is actually our Father, 
and that He leads us along in life. 

We should have before us a strong 
desire to do good to others. Never mind 
so much about ourselves. Good will 
come to us all right if we keep our 
minds outside of ourselves to a certain 
extent, and try to make others happier 
and draw them a little nearer to the 
Lord. We have been sent into the 
world to do good to others; and in do- 
ing good to others we do good to our- 
selves. We should always keep this in 
view, the husband in reference to his 
wife, the wife in reference to her hus- 
band, the children in reference to their 
parents, and the parents in reference to 
their children. There is always oppor- 
tunity to do good to one another. When 
you find yourselves a little gloomy, look 
around you and find somebody that is 
in a worse plight than yourself; go to 
him and find out what the trouble is, 
then try to remove it with the wisdom 
which the Lord bestows upon you; and 
the first thing you know, your gloom is

gone, you feel light, the Spirit of the 
Lord is upon you, and everything 
seems illuminated. 

Brethren and sisters, God bless you. 
Let us have a good Conference; and in 
order that we may have, let us have a 
prayerful spirit all the time, and especi- 
ally when Elders arise here to address 
you. Amen. 

ELDER RUDGER CLAWSON. 
Pride and class distinctions displeasing to God- 
Duty of supporting the poor— Titne-paying is 
educational. 

I will read a few words from the 
2nd chapter of Jacob in the Book of 
Mormon: 

"Think of your brethren, like unto 
yourselves, and be familiar with all, 
and free with your substance, that they 
may be rich like unto you. 

"But before ye seek for riches, seek ye 
for the kingdom of God. 

"And after ye have obtained a hope in 
Christ, ye shall obtain riches, if ye 
seek them; and ye will seek them, for 
the intent to do good; to clothe the 
naked, and to feed the hungry, and to 
liberate the captive, and administer re- 
lief to the sick, and the afflicted. 

"And now, my brethren.I have spoken 
unto you concerning pride; and those of 
you which have afflicted your neigh- 
bor, and persecuted him because ye 
were proud in your hearts, of the things 
which God hath given you, what say 
ye of it? 

"Do ye not suppose that such things 
are abominable unto him who created 
all flesh? And the one being is as 
precious in his sight as the other. And 
all flesh is of the dust; and for the self- 
same end hath he created them, that 
they should keep his commandments, 
and glorify him for ever." 

My brethren and sisters: I have se- 
lected a text this morning, but I do not 
know that I shall be able to speak to 
it as I desire at all times to leave my 
mind open to the impressions of the 
Holy Spirit, and not place myself in a 
position to resist that influence. 
I am reminded of a circumstance 
that occurred with one of the home 
missionaries in the Boxelder Stake, 
which shows that it is not always safe 
to rely upon a text. This brother was 
called to go out and visit one of the 
wards, and before going he selected a 
text. He pondered upon the text, and 
perhaps considered in a measure what 
he should say. When he came to the 
meeting he opened the Bible and 
turned to the page where he expected 



to find Ms text. He searched and 
searched, but could not find it. He must 
have been five minutes before that con- 
gregation hunting for his text, and he 
stood as one who was dazed. After 
a few moments, however, the Spiiit of 
the Lord came to his assistance, and he 
made a pretty good talk, doubtless bet- 
ter thp" if he had followed the text. 
It transpired that the particular leaf 
containing the words he expected to 
read had been lost from that Bible, 
and that was the reason he could not 
find his text. 

I believe that it is the purpose of the 
Lord to make this people rich. See 
what a vast multitude inhabit these 
valleys of the mountains. Go out among 
them; study their characteristics — in- 
dustry.temperance. thrift — and they are 
such as will make an-" people wealthy 
in the course of time. But there is 
danger in riches. Jacob was aware ot 
this, and he called the attention of his 
people to it. The possession of wealth 
generally brings class distinctions; class 
distinctions bring pride; and pride, we 
are told, is an abomination in the sight 
of heaven. These class distinctions are 
very apparent in the world, more par- 
ticularly in the large cities. We read 
the other day of a wedding in high life, 
and we were told that millions of mon- 
ey were married to millions of money, 
and that it was a very auspicious af- 
fair. Everything connected with that 
wedding was of the most magnificent 
order. Costly presents were made, in- 
cluding diamonds of rare value, and 
golden dishes. Think of people eating 
out of golden dishes, and at the same 
time being surrounded by many who 
are not in a condition to purchase even 
the simple necessaries of life, some per- 
haps actually starving to death for 
the want of food. Now, the children of 
the rich, surrounded by the condition* 
that I have mentioned, with superior 
opportunities of education and culture, 
in time, get to think that they are bet- 
ter than the children of the poor. They 
can wear better clothing, they can eat 
better food, they have better condi- 
tions in every way, and so seem to 
think they are better. Let us imagine 
for a moment a poor man, albeit an 
honest, intelligent man, and one who 
may stand high in the estimation of 
heaven, coming into a gathering of the

rich— why, the social distinction be- 
tween that poor man and the rich man 
Is so great that doubtless it would ba 
thought to be a contamination to have 
him there, and a demand for his with- 
drawal would be made. They cannot 
associate together. Yet, my brethren 
and sisters, the Prophet Jacob tells us 
that we are made of one flesh. God 
does not draw these distinctions that 
we find upon the earth. We are led to 
understand from the scriptures that 
God is no respector of per- 
sons, and that these social distinctions 
that are in the world, and in some de- 
gree perhaps in our midst, are not 
pleasing in His sight. He judges 
not as men judge. He looks not up- 
on the features; He considers not the 
wearing apparel; but He looks into the 
heart. We have seen this exemplified 
in many cases. You will remember the 
case of David. Samuel the prophet 
was sent by God to anoint a king over 
Israel, and he was to find this king 
among the sons of Jesse. Doubtless, 
Jesse was very much pleased with this 
idea, and he passed his sons in review 
before the prophet. They were fine, 
beautiful men. It may be that Samuel 
himself was impressed with their ap- 
pearance, and if he had been left to 
himself he might have selected one of 
them; but the Spirit of the Lord whis- 
pered to him that he was not to place 
his hands on any of those. So the 
prophet enquired of Jesse if he had 
other sons, and Jesse remembered that 
he did have another son — a boy — who 
was out herding the sheep. The prophet 
asked to see him. When he came into 
his presence the Spirit of the Lord in- 
spired the prophet to say, This is the 
man. He laid his hands upon him and 
anointed him to be king of Israel. The 
Lord judged from the heart. He knew 
the hearts of these sons of Jesse, and 
David was the chosen one. 

So, my brethren and sisters, if there 
are to be distinctions among us, they 
must not be based upon our financial 
condition, but rather upon the princi- 
ple of righteousness. One man is bet- 
ter than another if he is more righteous 
than the other. One man is more ac- 
ceptable to the Lord than another 
if he lives nearer to the Lord than the 
other. 

The prophet Jacob points out very 



clearly the manner in which it would 
be safe for His people to seek after 
riches. First seek the kingdom 
of God and its righteousness, 
and all other things will be 
added. Then if we seek for riches we 
will do it with the intent to accom- 
plish good and to use them for the 
benefit and blessing of mankind and for 
the establishment and upbuilding of 
the Church and Kingdom of God. Be- 
sides, administering to the wants of 
the poor and to the sick and afflicted, 
the Prophet Jacob might also have with 
propriety mentioned the principle of 
tithing — if they observed that law in 
that day — and other principles per- 
taining to the Gospel. I have thought 
sometimes that God revealed this prin- 
ciple of tithing to His people in order 
that they should not be swallowed up 
in a spirit of selfishness; ' that their 
souls might be enlarged by taking of 
their substance and imparting it to 
the Church, and performing other 
righteous deeds. 

The poor we have always with us. It 
was said by Abraham Lincoln that God 
must love the poor because he has made 
so many of them. The Savior seemed 
to think a great deal of the poor. He 
came to preach the Gospel to them, to 
administer to their wants, to heal the 
sick, to cast out devils, to open the 
eyes of the blind. His life and His 
ministry was devoted to the poor. You 
will find, if you study closely the reve- 
lations of God found in the Book of 
Covenants, that a great amount of 
space is devoted to the poor. We are 
reminded of them continually; that 
we shall divide our substance with 
them. The fast day has been instituted, 
in part, for that purpose. It has been 
estimated that if the entire people of 
the Latter-day Saints would give to 
the poor the value of the two meals 
that they refrain or should refrain 
from partaking of upon that day, the 
poor of this church would be well pro- 
vided for. But, let me tell you, this 
is not done; at least, it is not done in 
our Stake, and I presume it is not done 
in other Stakes. I have sometimes 
thought it would be an excellent 
thing to revive the custom of early 
days, in sending to the various fami- 
lies in the ward and gather- 
ing up their fast offerings; for 



ELDER ABRAHAM O WOODRUFF

the Bishops of the Church well 
know that the people many times 
have offering's to make that they can- 
not very well carry to the fast meet- 
ing, and by sending around and re- 
minding the people of this duty, a great 
amount of good can be accomplished. 
I have recommended this to the Bish- 
ops in the Boxelder Stake, and where 
they have carried out this counsel most 
excellent results have followed. This 
is a matter of vital importance. If 
we neglect the poor, God will neglect 
us. We must look after them. Those 
who are so highly favored must divide 
their substance with them. And we 
must remember to observe this law of 
tithing. When a man's income 
amounts to only a few hun- 
dred dollars a year, it is a 
simple matter to pay tithing; but you 
will notice that as a man is increased 
in his substance, as God opens the win- 
dows of heaven and pours down bless- 
ings upon him, there is a tendency to 
drop off in the paying of tithing. It is 
easier for a man who is getting a thou- 
sand dollars a year to pay an honest 
tithing to the Lord than for a man who 
is getting ten thousand dollars a year; 
and it is easier for a man who gets ten 
thousand dollars a year to pay an hon- 
est tithing than for a man who gets 
a hundred thousand dollars a year. 
It seems to be almost impossible for a 
man with that enormous income to pay 
a just tithing to the Lord. Yet the tith- 
ing belongs to the Lord, and He ex- 
pects that we will observe this law, 
that this may be indeed a land of Zion 
unto us. 

Brethren and sisters, I rejoice in pon- 
dering upon the principles of the Gos- 
pel; and in my weak way I am endeav- 
oring to observe these laws and com- 
mandments. I feel blessed in it, and 
I can recommend it to you. I know 
there is a blessing attendant upon the 
observance of the laws of God. I 
pray that His blessing may be upon the 
us, that His peace may be in our midst, 
and that His Spirit may be poured out 
abundantly upon the Saints in this 
general Conference, that we may be 
strengthened, edified, renewed in our 
faith, and encouraged to go on and ac- 
complish the will of God. I ask it in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 



ELDER ABRAHAM O. WOODRUFF. 

Value of inspired counsel— The Saints expanding 
by faith and colonization— Success in mission- 
ary work. 

I assure you, my brethren and sisters, 
that in occupying' this position this 
morning I feel very humble, and very 
dependent upon the Lord for His Spirit 
to give me utterance. I rejoice in see- 
ing so many present, and in realizing 
the number of aged veterans there are 
in our midst who lived in the days of 
the Prophet Joseph, and who are 
pleased to bear testimony of the divin- 
ity of that Prophet's mission. It is re- 
markable how the Lord has preserved 
so many of those who lived in the days 
of the Prophet Joseph, and I am always 
made glad in listening to their testi- 
mony for those who were so intimately 
associated with the Prophet, and who 
knew him best, loved him best. I thank 
the Lord that He has preserved the 
Prophet of God who stands in our mi3st 
today, and has sustained him and does 
sustain him by His matchless power. I 
rejoice in his teachings, and the people 
ought to appreciate the counsels given 
by this man of God. Many people wish 
they had lived in the time when Christ 
was upon the earth; they think they 
would have loved the Lord and been 
more devoted to Him than they are at 
the present time. But every time we 
hold a general Conference we uphold 
and sustain the Prophet of God as His 
mouthpiece, His vicegerent upon the 
earth, and the question arises in my 
mind many times, Do we appreciate the 
counsels that are given us from this 
man? Are we willing to accept of his 
words as the word of God? When we 
ask his advice, do we ask believing and 
expecting to carry it out, whether it 
comes in conflict with our own selfish 
desires and ambitions or not? I often 
feel that we do not. People ask coun- 
sel at times if they think they can get 
that which will be favorable to their 
own selfish desires; but if they 
thought they would get counsel which 
would be contrary to their own wishes, 
they would refrain from asking it. 

In visiting the outside settlements of 
Zion I have been made to realize the 
great faith of the people. I have won- 
dered at the works they have per- 
formed, through the faith they have in

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



God. Many thousands have proven be- 
yond a doubt that they are willing to 
trust implicitly in the word of God as 
it is given through His mouthpiece. 
But there are others who are not so 
Willing. There are men holding the 
Priesthood, who are praying from day 
to day that they may receive light upon 
certain subjects, and if the prophet of 
God were to say to them what course 
they should pursue and give them the 
light for which they have sought, in 
some cases they would decline to follow 
that course. But the men who will not 
carry out the instruction given through 
President Lorenzo Snow are not in har- 
mony with God, for I testify to you 
that he is the mouthpiece of the Most 
High upon the face of the earth; and 
those who refuse to accept his teach- 
ings, if they do not repent, will lose 
the spirit of this work and will aposta- 
tize, as the Lord lives. 

We have much to be thankful for in 
being able to meet together in this gen- 
eral conference. Sixty-nine years ago 
today the Church of Jesus Christ was 
organized in a little log house, with six 
members. Look at it today! Those who 
have traveled through the Stakes real- 
ize how Zion's boundaries are being ex- 
tended, and how the people are growing 
in faith and in good works. Only those 
who are disgruntled believe that the 
Church is going backward. I tell you, 
the people are gaining in faith and in 
good works. They are colonizing the 
country; they are beginning to possess 
the earth, to own their own homes, to 
cultivate the soil, and they are be- 
coming a great and a mighty people. 
I do not think that conditions were 
ever so favorable as they are today 
for the enlarging of the borders of 
Zion and for the growth of the people. 
Most excellent opportunities are offered 
for colonization, whereby the people 
can obtain a foothold in the land and 
make a living out of mother earth. The 
people seem to be attending to their 
duties and exercising a faith equal to 
that which has been exercised at any 
time since the organization of the 
Church. 

My labors during the last year have 
chiefly been among the people in the 
outlying Stakes. I have visited our 
settlements in Canada, in Arizona, in 
Mexico, and in southern Utah, and I 



can say we have in these Stakes a 
good people, a God-fearing people, a 
people who are willing to receive the 
counsels . which God has for them 
through His mouthpiece. Those Stakes 
have been settled by people who have 
been called to go there, and it has 
seemed to me that those who had not 
the courage to carry out the instruc- 
tions of God in establishing those 
places have not been able to endure the 
hardships and privations which came 
upon them, and they have therefore 
returned to their old homes and left 
those who had faith in the Lord and 
valued the advice He gave them 
through His mouthpiece, and they are 
among the most faithful people to be 
found in this Church today. 

I rejoice in the labor that our mis- 
sionaries are performing. I rejoice in 
the growth of the work of the Lord in 
every field; for it is growing, notwith- 
standing the persecution that is brought 
against it from time to time. As long 
as persecution comes from without, we 
can combat it, and it does not injure 
the work of the Lord; but when there 
is disunion among the people, and 
a tendency to disregard counsel, then 
there is danger in Zion. So long, how- 
ever, as the leading quorums of this 
Church are united as they they are to- 
day; so long as the people are united 
and are willing to receive the in- 
structions that are given of God 
through His Prophet, all will be well, 
and the Church will continue to grow 
and increase. People marvel today at 
the growth of this work from six mem- 
bers. Since 1830 it has grown into 
something like forty Stakes of Zion and 
many missions in the world, and the 
principles of the Gospel are heard in 
every land where liberty is granted un- 
to us to proclaim them. It has been 
decreed that this Gospel shall be 
preached in all the world, for a wit- 
ness unto every people, and then 
shall the end come. It is remarkable 
the willingness that the Elders show 
in responding to the calls made upon 
them to go to the nations of the earth 
to proclaim this • Gospel. Many who 
have apparently manifested no partic- 
ular interest in this work, when they 
are called to go forth to proclaim the 
Gospel, rarely ever refuse; and today 
there are more Elders in the world 



ELDER ABRAHAM O. WOODRUFF.

preaching this Gospel than there has 
ever been. This should be indeed en- 
couraging- to the Latter-day Saints. 
When I think of the constant drain 
upon this people to maintain the mis- 
sionaries in the field, I marvel at the 
prosperity of the people. But the 
Lord blesses and prospers us in sus- 
taining these missionaries and in res- 
ponding to the many calls that are 
made upon us. This labor is upon 
us to carry the Gospel to the world, 
that those who sit in darkness may see 
the light. It is incumbent upon every 
man who holds the Priesthood of a 
Seventy in the Church to go forth and 
preach the Gospel; and if he does not 
when called, it will be with him as with 
Paul, Woe be unto him if he preach 
not the Gospel of Christ when he is 
called by the Prophet of the Lord to 
go forth and proclaim it. 

T have a testimony, my brethren and 
sisters, that this is the work of God. 
I know that the sick are healed; I 
know that the Lord answers the 
prayers of His people; I know that 
this people have been able on 
some occasions to even control 
the elements for their safety and 
for the upbuilding of Zion. I rejoice 
in being present with you this morning 
and partaking of the sweet influence of 
His Holy Spirit. Did this people ever 
come together with a desire to be fed 
with the bread of life, and they were 
not able to receive that whicn they de- 
sired? No, this has never been the 
case. God has always inclined His ear 
to this people; He has always delivered 
them from their afflictions; He has al- 
ways blessed them. He has been in- 
deed kind and fatherly to us as indi- 
viduals and as a people. The prospects 
for the development and spread of this 
work were never brighter, never more 
hopeful, than they are at the present 
time. I admonish the Latter-day Saints 
in all lands to seek the counsel of the 
prophet of God. Do not be disobedient; 
do not be rebellious. The spirit of re- 
bellion caused, we understand, one-third 
of the hosts of heaven to be cast out. 
The spirit of disobedience and rebellion 
has caused many a man and woman to 
be cast out of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints. The grav- 
er sins do not come into our lives all at 
once. Very often men can trace trans- 



gression to the fact that they rebelled 
against the priesthood of the Son of 
God, and that they did not take the 
counsel which the Lord had given them 
through His mouthpiece; and they did 
not end with the spirit of rebellion 
and obedience, but they committed 
other great sins, and finally lost their 
standing in the Church of Christ. This 
rule will apply to us today, and I pray 
God that this people may ever be will- 
ing to receive the counsels which the 
Lord has to give through His prophet. 
Some become so engrossed with politi- 
cal parties, or with secret societies, or 
something of the kind, that they pay 
them greater devotion than they do the 
word of God. This is wrong. The Lord 
has built up this western country 
through His people who came here to 
worship Him according to the dictates 
of their own hearts. Let us not 
forget that. Let us not forget that 
we owe our first and foremost 
devotion to God, the Eternal Father. 
We sustain President Lorenzo Snow as 
the mouthpiece of God. Therefore, 
when he has anything to say to us aa 
the mind and will of the Lord, it is just 
as binding upon us as if God spake 
personally to us. I ofttimes think of 
the parable of Lazarus and the rich 
man, and I sometimes think the Latter- 
day Saints manifest a spirit like that 
which was exhibited by the rich man 
when he was in torment on account of 
the evil life he had led on earth. He 
had brothers whom he desired to be 
saved, and he petitioned Father Abra- 
ham that one who had risen from the 
dead should go to these brothers and 
tell them of their ways and call them 
to repent. But Abraham remarked that 
they had Moses and the Prophets, and 
if they would not believe them they 
would not believe one though he were 
risen from the dead. I tell you that if 
we do not feel in our hearts to sus- 
tain the prophets of God, we would 
not believe the Lord if He were to 
come Himself, or if He were to send 
one that was risen from the dead. 
There is no need for the Lord to send 
special messengers to tell us our duty. 
The Lord has placed President Lorenzo 
Snow as the prophet, seer and revelator 
to this Church; and if we desire to 
keep in harmony with this work we 
must listen to the words which

the Lord God gives to us through His 
Prophet. 

May the Lord bless you, brethren and 
sisters; may he pour out His spirit 
upon us; may we never rebel, nor lose 
the faith; may we be willing to receive 
the counsel of the Lord through His 
Prophet whenever it is given to us. I 
ask it for Christ's sake. Amen.

Prophetic gift of Joseph Smith— Early manifesta- 
tion of God and the ministration of Angels- 
Opposition of the world— God guides His -work 
by revelation. 

My brethren and sisters, I am pleased 
to meet with you at this conference. I 
humbly ask you to pray for me, that 
the Holy Spirit may suggest what may 
be said. 

I rejoice in the celebration of the na- 
tal day of the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints, and in being a 
recipient of the blessings which are 
enjoyed by the members thereof, and 
which have come to us, to a very great 
extent, through the labors incident to 
the establishment of this Church and 
the tribulations which were encount- 
ered by the Prophet Joseph Smith. 
Whatever characterized a prophet in 
olden times characterized the great 
prophet of the last days. We point very 
frequently to the remarkable fulfil- 
ment of predictions which have been ut- 
tered in ancient times by theJewish pro- 
phets as an evidence of the divine au- 
thority which they bore and of the re- 
markable work which was accom- 
plished by them in the interest of hu 
manity. We may point with equal joy 
and satisfaction to the remarkable ut- 
terances of the Prophet Joseph, to es- 
tablish the divine authenticity of his 
claim. I have never heard of a pre- 
diction uttered by that man which has 
not been verified, so far as time has 
brought the prophecy due. I have 
never discovered any characteristic as- 
sociated with any of the rncient 
prophets of God in the work which they 
accomplished, and which went to prove 
their divine mission, which cannot be 
pointed to in the Prophet Joseph Smith 
and his work. He came to the world an- 
nouncing a new dispensation. He did 
not derive his information respecting 
religious matters from reading the 



scriptures only. He did act upon the 
promise of the Apostle James, con- 
tained in the Bible, (and which is appli- 
cable to our young people in securing a 
testimony of the truth) where he says: 
"If any of you lack wisdom, let him 
ask of God, that giveth to all men lib- 
erally, and upbraideth not; and it shall 
be given him." The Prophet, in the 
confusion which came to his mind by 
listening to the conflicting sentiments 
of the various factions of Christianity, 
resorted to reading the scripture foi 
himself, and he concluded to test this 
passage that I have quoted. He was 
inspired with the same faith that ac- 
tuated the ancient Saints of God — the 
same faith that was taught by the Sa- 
vior when He said, "Ask, and ye shall 
receive; knock, and it shall be opened 
unto you." He went into the woods to 
pray, and he besought the Lord to 
know which of all the factions of 
Christianity was acknowledged by the 
God of heaven. In answer to this 
prayer, he received a communication 
from God, the Eternal Father, in which 
the glory of heaven rested upon him, 
and in that glory there was presented 
before this young man two heavenly 
personages. When he had strength to 
ask the question which he desired to 
propound, one of these personages said 
unto him, "This is my beloved Son; 
hear, him." The son informed the 
Prophet Joseph that He did not recog- 
nize any of the denominations. Among 
them were honest people, people who 
were doing the best they could with the 
light they had; but they had not been 
founded upon tb^e revelations of God, 
andHe commanded this young man that 
he should not identify himself with an> 
denomination, and that if he would lis- 
ten to this counsel the day would come 
when he should be instrumental in the 
hands of God in accomplishing a great 
and a mighty work in the earth. This 
young man was faithful to this in- 
junction. He did not follow the ways 
of the world, and in due time he re- 
ceived another communication from 
God, in which a holy angel 
appeared unto him and revealed to him 
the existence of some sacred records, 
(from a translation of which Brother 
Rudger Clawson has read a few state- 
ments), containing a brief history of the 
inhabitants of this continent from a

period 600 years before Christ down to 
about 400 years after Christ; also a 
concise statement of a people who had 
come to this land from the Tower of 
Babel, when the languages were con- 
founded. This angel of the Lord ap- 
peared to the Prophet Joseph three 
times during the night of the 21st of 
September, 1823. He met him next at 
the nlace where these sacred plates 
were deposited, and commanded him to 
meet him there on that day of the 
month each year for four years, when, 
if he was faithful in keeping the com- 
mandments of God, he should receive 
these sacred writings. He was faithful 
to this injunction, and on the 22nd of 
September, 1827, the angel of the Lord 
delivered these plates into the hands 
of the Prophet Joseph Smith, who 
translated them by the use of the Urim 
and Thummin, as he was led by the 
spirit of revelation from God. Through 
this we have what is called the Book 
of Mormon. 

In laying the foundation of this great 
work the Prophet Joseph was not sus 
tained by the popular sentiment of 
mankind, nor by the hope of any world- 
ly inducement; but he was actuated 
by the conviction and the understand- 
ing that he had received a revelation 
from God; that he had seen the Father 
and the Son; that he had received the 
ministration of holy angels. He endur- 
ed the trials that the ancient prophets 
passed through; he suffered persecu- 
tion, imprisonment and privation; he 
offered his life for the work, and he 
sealed his testimony with his blood. 
The Apostle Paul tells us that where 
there is a testament there is of neces- 
sity the death of the testator. He 
has offered to the world his testimony, 
the fulfilment of his prophecies, the 
verification of the promises made 
by him. Those who would lis- 
ten to this voice of insniration 
and receive the Gospel as revealed 
through him were promised that they 
should receive a witness for themselves. 
In the offering made by the Prophet 
Joseph Smith nothing was withheld 
that was offered by the ancient proph- 
ets of God and by the Savior himself. 
And I wish to bear testimony that I 
have received the witness that Joseph 
Smith was a prophet of the Almighty. 
I have received the testimony that he 



was commanded of God to found this 
work and to organize the Church after 
the primitive pattern; that he received 
revelation and was guided by it all the 
days of his life, from the inception of 
the work until the hour when his life 
was sacrificed in Carthage jail for the 
testimony of Jesus and the word of 
God. The Saints of God, in all the try- 
ing ordeals through which they passed 
under the administration of the Proph- 
et Joseph Smith, were sustained and 
preserved. In the establishment of this 
work it was designed of the Father that 
the same spirit and power should con- 
tinue with the Church down to the 
latest period of time; and I wish to 
bear my testimony — and I wish my 
brethren and sisters to remember it and 
to instill it into the hearts of their chil- 
dren — that the prophets who have stood 
at the head of his Church since the 
death of the Prophet Joseph have been 
guided by the spirit of revelation. I 
am reminded of a statement made by 
the Prophet Amos, in his 3rd chapter 
and 7th verse: 

"Surely the Lord God will do nothing, 
but he revealeth his secret unto his 
servants the prophets." 

In view of this, we may say that 
when He did not have a prophet upon 
the earth He was not doing anything, 
so far as the great plan of salvation 
is concerned; that is, the ordinances of 
that plan were not being administered, 
and He was not communicating His 
will to His children respecting the plan 
of redemption. However, His hand was 
manifest in the progress and in the en- 
lightenment of the world, and in the 
extension of human liberty. Where 
there has been no prophet of 
God the people have not received the 
light of revelation to the extent that 
they could understand and apply the 
ordinances of salvation. As Solomon 
says, in Proverb 29: 18: "Where there 
is no vision, the people perish;" and Ho- 
sea said that the Lord had spoken by 
prophets, and had multiplied visions 
and used similitudes, by the ministry 
of the prophets. "By a prophet the 
Lord brought Israel out of Egypt, and 
by a prophet was he preserved. 1 ' And 
I want to say to the Latter-day Saints 
that Israel in modern times have been 
preserved by the same means. Those 
who listened to the voice of the in-

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



spired Prophet in the commencement, 
no matter what sacrifice it cost them, 
were sustained by the power of God. 
This is true also respecting- the ad- 
ministration of President Brigiiam 
Young-. What a wonderful work he 
accomplished, building upon the founda- 
tion laid by God through the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, and carrying out the 
plan which had been predicted by the 
Prophet Joseph! In leading the Lat- 
ter-day Saints to these mountains and 
establishing their feet here, he was 
but carrying out the great plan that 
had been revealed to the Prophet Jo- 
seph Smith, who had prophesied on the 
fi+b of Aue-ust, 1843, that some of the 
people would die of persecution, some 
would die of trial and hardship, but 
some, he said, would live to go beyond 
the Rocky Mountains and see the Lat- 
ter-day Saints become a mighty people 
in that region of country. This prophecy 
has been fulfilled as well as other pre- 
dictions he uttered in connection with 
this work, as established in these moun- 
tain valleys. The Latter-day Saints 
are safe as long as they listen to the 
voice of inspiration. I rejoice that we 
have President Lorenzo Snow with us 
today. I rejoice that the Lord has 
spared his life. He is now eighty-five 
years of age; he is in the possession of 
all his faculties, bright, clear and 
active; and God has sustained 
him in his administrations, and 
brought him to stand at our head at 
this present period of time. I am re- 
minded of what was said of the Proph- 
et Moses, that notwithstanding his age 
his eye waxed not dim, neither did his 
natural force abate. The Lord has 
■done this for those who have presided 
over His Church in the last days. He 
has sustained them in body and in 
mind: He has preserved their lives, 
that we might profit by their vast ex- 
perience. I rejoice in this fact, and T 
wish to express my gratitude before 
God and before this congregation that 
the Lord has preserved President Snow 
to administer unto us and to s 
us the benefit of his great experience in 
this latter day work. 

I trust, my brethren and sisters, that 
during our conference we shall be fed 
with the bread of life, that we shall 



receive here a little and there a little, 
and that from what is said by the 
speakers each and every one of us may 
find something applicable to ourselves, 
which we can take home and carry out 
in our daily lives. I trust also that 
we may have the spirit of the business 
that may be transacted at this confer- 
ence, whatever it may be. There is a 
very great responsibility resting upon 
the authorities of the Church. I feel 
that it is an immense responsibility to 
be a servant of God. I feel my un- 
worthiness in occupying such a posi- 
tion among the Saints of God, and I 
cannot occupy it unless I am sustained 
by the Almighty. But while there is a 
great responsibility resting upon the 
Presidency and the general authorities 
of this Church, there is a correspond- 
ing responsibility resting upon every 
man and every woman in the Church. 
We are not alone in bearing the holy 
priesthood, we are not the only ones 
that have received the testimony of the 
Holy Ghost. We all have received this 
testimony who have been brought into 
communion with God. Hence there is 
a responsibility of a weighty character 
resting upon all of us, in every avenue 
of life and in all the interests of this 
work. And the interests of this work 
are varied. They are not all what is 
called spiritual; if they were, we would 
die temporally. They are not all tem- 
poral; if they were, we would die spirit- 
ually. But it is all spiritual unto God. 
He designs that the laborer in Zion 
shall labor for Zion, and that in all 
things we shall be actuated by the 
spirit of God, so that all we do may be 
sanctified to His honor and glory and 
to the accomplishment of His great 
work upon the earth. 

May the Lord bless you, my brethren 
and sisters; and when we leave this 
conference, may we leave it renewed in 
strength, in faith and in a determina- 
tion to keep the commandments of God 
and walk in the paths of life. This is 
my prayer in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

The choir sang the hymn commenc- 
ing. 

How are thy servants blest! O Lord, 
How sure is their defense! 

Benediction was pronounced by Pat- 
riarch John Smith.

•Giving employment to the poor— Home manufac- 
tures. 

I hope while I shall speak to you, my 
brethren and sisters, that I shall be 
under the influence of the same spirit 
as guided our beloved brethren who 
spoke this forenoon. It is pleasant 
to have the privilege of meeting with 
the Saints in general Conference. We 
feel that there is a great deal of the 
spirit of God present and we delight to 
hear our leaders speak unto us. 

At this Conference we are favored 
by having the First Presidency, the 
Apostles, and the Presidents of Seven- 
ties with us. I do not remember that 
this has been the case for many years. 
I believe that during this Conference 
the Lord will bless us and give us a 
rich outpouring of His Holy Spirit. 

One of the brethren this forenoon al- 
luded to the many hundreds of Elders 
we have in the field working for the 
spread of the truth. We have glorious 
reports from the different missions; our 
brethren are doing well and laboring 
to gather sheep into the fold of Christ; 
and the Lord is blessing their endeav- 
ors. Now, while the great majority 
of us are not called upon to go* out in- 
to the active missionary field, there is 
still a great mission which all of us 
can perform. The Latter-day Saints 
at home have a great deal to do. Our 
brethren gather Israel from the dif- 
ferent nations of the earth. Most of 
the Saints when they come have ex- 
hausted their means in bringing them 
to Zion; they come to a strange land; 
the customs are different, and they 
have not many acquaintances, though 



thfv have many friends. We should 
look after these, that they be not dis- 
couraged. They may not be able to 
find the kind of work they have been 
used to do, and we may not be able to 
provide that for them, but we should 
try to give them an opportunity to earn 
their livelihood. We do not want to 
make paupers of them. We want to 
study ways and devise means whereby 
they can earn their living in our midst. 
Our missionaries who return should 
continue to take the same lively in- 
terest in the Saints after they gather 
as they did when they were laboring 
in their midst in the different fields 
abroad. Sometimes they feel hurt 
w T hen they come here and no 
notice is taken of them. The 
missionaries who are acquainted with 
them should take some interest in them 
and try to do something for them. A 
great many are doing this, and I am 
always pleased when I hear the mis- 
sionaries make inquiries about ac- 
quaintances, to know if they arrived; 
and to see interest taken in them; but I 
have seen other cases where our emi- 
grants have felt as if they were not 
looked after, and if under such circum- 
stances, when they feel a little slight- 
ed, they should come in contact with 
those who are disaffected it may make 
them so, and cause some of them to 
return to the places where they former- 
ly lived; and such have at times done a 
great deal of harm to the cause. We 
can fulfill part of a mission in looking 
after the Saints when they have gath- 
ered; we should see to it that employ- 
ment is provided for them. In early 
years those who embraced the Gospel 
were mostly from the rural districts — 
farmers. When they came here they 
did not want to stay In the city; they 
wanted to go out where they could get 
land and the same kind of employment 
they had been used to, and they soon 
established themselves and prospered. 
Of late years our missionaries in Eu- 
rope have not been able to do much 
among the rural population, but have 
done more in the cities, and more of 
those who live in large cities have 
joined the Church than of those outside 
the cities, and when these come here 
they seek the more populous centers 
as they are not accustomed to farming. 
Such should be looked after and en-

couraged to go out into the settlements. 
Our settlements here are not like the 
rural districts in Europe. Nearly all 
of our settlements have the advantages 
of cities — good schools, good societies, 
and the advantages that are found in 
cities in the old world are to a certain 
extent to be found in most of our larger 
settlements. Our brethren and sisters 
who come from the cities, need not stay 
here in Salt Lake City to enjoy the 
same advantages they did before they 
came, but they can go out into the larger 
settlements, and it will not be hard for 
those who are not too old to accustom 
themselves to labor on the farms. Many 
who have been brought up to a certain 
kind of employment in factories, or 
different handicrafts, may not be able 
to get the same kind of employment 
here, but many of them can go out and 
take hold of the work that is to be 
found in our settlements, and it 
will not take them long to establish 
themselves and get homes of their own. 
They will feel happier in doing so, and 
though farming is often connected with 
hard work, the labor has been lightened 
of late years to a great degree. Our 
farmers by getting machinery, can do 
much of their work sitting.and the hard 
work that our brethren tell us they did 
in early days is not required today. I 
speak thus to encourage our brethren 
and sisters, who have come to these 
larger cities and cannot get employ- 
ment, to go out into the more distant 
settlements. I believe there are about 
as good openings now as there ever 
were. There are many places where 
people can take up lands yet, or can get 
land cheaply and have a chance to 
work for the land they get. It is true 
they cannot take up large tracts of 
land as the earlier settlers might have 
done if they had so desired, but they 
did not do that. The counsel 
was to make small farms, and 
we have seen the wisdom of this. 
The brethren who will go out now 
need not fear that they will starve and 
will be in want of anything. Our breth- 
ren and sisters out in the country feel 
to help those who come into their m dst. 
The Industrial Bureau, which was es- 
tablished, I hope will be an institution 
that can do much good for our poor. 
Those who have means ought to study 



how to use their means to give employ- 
ment, that there should not be any idle 
hands in Zion. The hoarding up of 
means, trying to get riches for riches' 
sake, will not make a man happy. We 
had a text read here this morning by 
Brother Clawson, which I think is an 
excellent one. The prophet advises us 
before seeking riches, that we should 
seek the kingdom of God, and after we 
have done that, then he promises that 
we shall get riches, if we will seek them 
for the sole purpose of doing good. I 
believe the Lord will bless this people 
and make them a rich people if they 
will first seek His kingdom and Hi» 
righteousness, and providing the object 
in gathering riches will be that they 
may be able to do more good. 

"We used to have more preaching 
upon home manufacture. I believe those 
teachings are as good today as they 
were years ago. What if we cannot fol- 
low the fashions from abroad to so 
great an extent? We ought to make 
ourselves a self-sustaining people; we 
have all the elements right here 
in our State to make us 
such. Yesterday I read the 
report of Z. C. M. I. for the last year. 
It said there had been about seventy 
thousand pairs of shoes made by that 
factory. This is quite a step toward 
stopping the importation of shoes. If 
we had ten such factories in our midst 
I presume we could supply our needs 
in the shoe line. The report also stated 
that they had made some one hundred 
and thirty thousand garments — over- 
alls and jumpers. I was pleased with 
this item. Though they do not make 
much money in these departments, yet 
they keep a great deal of means in our 
midst; and this should be encouraged. 
We should encourage all of our home 
institutions that are trying to stop the 
outlet of means, so that the money we 
obtain can be kept in circulation among 
us a longer time. Let us take a pride 
in our home manufactures. Let us 
see to it that we do as much as we can 
to give our poor employment. 

I am sorry to think our tanneries 
have not been a success; I think they 
could be made so. We have an enor- 
mous lot of hides going out from this 
State. They are tanned abroad and 
brought back here in a manufactured

shape. We could retain a great deal 
of means here by manufacturing our 
own leather. Bark is not easy to be 
secured here, but perhaps other means 
of obtaining tannic acid can be had 
and a success made of this branch of 
industry. All of our wool that goes 
out and is brought back as cloth would 
have been a great saving if we could 
have manufactured it here, and then 
sent it out as manufactured goods. 

Brethren and sisters, there are so 
many things that our leading brethren 
in the different settlements should 
study and think of and advise the peo- 
ple to do that we may be a prosperous 
people. We cannot afford to keep up 
the style we do and do it on raising 
wheat and selling that at forty cents 
a bushel. Some change must be had 
in this. I noticed when I was back on 
my mission in visiting my native land, 
Denmark, that a great change has come 
over that country. The^' formerly ex- 
ported their rye and other grain, and 
while they did so they were a poor 
people. Of late years they import grain, 
feed it to their stock and export their 
butter, their eggs, and their meat to 
England. They have been able to ob- 
tain a higher price for their articles of 
export. The farms there are prosper- 
ing, or rather, they would have pros- 
pered, if they had kept to their old 
methods, frugality and simple man- 
ners; but they are trying to educate 
their boys and giving them city appe- 
tites; they can not live on their coun- 
try incomes, and they are goins?- into 
debt, giving mortgages on their farms, 
while they are getting several times 
as much means as they were wont to 
do. I bring this up for our considera- 
tion. I believe if we could use up our 
grain at home and export that which 
does not weigh so much, we would not 
have to pay so much freight, would 
have more means and make ourselves 
more independent. 

I have erot on the subject of home 
manufacture. I believe it is a thing 
we ought to study, brethren and sisters, 
for our well being r and we should look 
after the poor and give them employ- 
ment. 

May God bless you all and bless our 
leaders, is my prayer in the name of 
Jesus. Amen. 



ELDER MARRINER W. MERRILL. 

Expansiveness of the Latter-day Saints— Material 
Interests of the people— Debt should be avoided 
— A porfitable course for young people — Value 
of the counsels of the Priesthood. 

At these conferences there are so 
many subjects discussed that they can 
not fail to be edifying to all of the peo- 
ple. If only one subject were intro- 
duced and all of the speakers dwelt 
upon it, perhaps it would not be so in- 
teresting. I am glad to be associated 
with my brethren and sisters in this 
general conference. I have had a good 
many reflections in listening to the re- 
marks we have already heard. They 
have brought many things to my mind 
of a former date and of former times 
here in this country. While it is the 
privilege of all Latter-day Saints to 
have evidence for themselves of the 
truth of the Gospel and of the divine 
mission of the Prophet Joseph, we are 
not only instructed and reminded on 
these subjects, but are reminded of af- 
fairs that pertain to us of a temporal 
character. The Latter-day Saints are 
growing and spreading abroad. 

I met a gentleman on the train the 
other day from San Francisco. He was 
born and raised there; and he hadn't 
heard anything about our people; and 
he seemed very anxious to know some- 
thing about the doctrines of our 
Church. I said to him: 'We have a 
mission established in California; we 
have Elders laboring in the city where 
you hail from; you can hear our Elders 
any Sunday if you will inquire after 
them; and you can become acquainted 
with the doctrines of our Church.' He 
remarked that he supposed nearly all 
of the Latter-day Saints lived in Salt 
Lake City, and that during the last 
forty years there had not been much 
growth among them; that there had 
not been much expansion. I remarked 
to him that I was surprised that a man 
of his intelligence was not better ac- 
quainted with this people. 

Forty years ago I suppose the ma- 
jority of the Latter-day Saints were 
located in this valley— Salt Lake Val- 
ley, but today they are spread abroad 
and I advise the gentleman to get our 
Church works and read them; and it 
was a good opportunity to bear my 
testimony to him of the Gospel. I be- 
lieve there are many hundreds of thou-

sands of good honest people in the 
world that have but a very limit- 
ed knowledge and perhaps no 
knowledge at all of the ex- 
istence of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints. We would 
naturally suppose that everybody had 
heard of us from what has been said 
and published concerning us; but there 
are a. great many people that have not 
time to read those things. It is on a 
par with our conferences. A great many 
of our people right here in the city do 
not have time to come to conference; 
they are too busy, and they don't know 
anything of what is being done. Thus 
it is with the world; a great many ot 
them don't know that such a people ex- 
ist as the Latter-day Saints in these 
mountains; and they have no idea of 
our expansion, our growth, and our de- 
velopment in this country. 

1 said a few moments ago that the 
Latter-day Saints may satisfy them- 
selves with regard to the divine mis 
sion of the Prophet Joseph; and what 
does it require to become satisfied? It 
requires time and attention and a 
prayerful and thoughtful consideration 
of the doctrines of the Church, and of 
the scriptures; that which is written 
in the Bible, in the Book of Mormon, 
and the Church publications. Entreat 
the Lord in regard to it and no man 
will be turned away. It is said: 
"Knock and it shall be opened unto 
you; ask and ye shall receive." Do this 
that as members of the Church you 
may be able to give a reason for the 
hope that you have and have a testi- 
mony of this work . There are a great 
many conditions existing among the 
Lattei -day Saints on which we may 
improve. Apostle Lund referred to 
home manufacture. But little has been 
said a tout it of late years. There was 
a time when there was quite an excite- 
ment raised throughout the country 
about home production. I presume 
those things are going forward gradu- 
ally, as we can find a great many 
things of home production throughout 
the couniry. It is a good thing and we 
should encourage it, sustain it, think 
about it, study about it, not only here 
but in all of the organizations of the 
Church. It is a grand thing to be self- 
rupporting An individual, a family, 
or a community that is self-supporting 



is the best off. They are easiest in their 
circumstances. 

I believe we have made many mis- 
takes in the past as a people 
and as individuals; and there is no 
doubt but that we will continue to 
make mistakes from time to time, be- 
cause our judgments are not perfect, 
and we follow the solicitations of our 
families and of our friends, and indulge 
in things that we should not indulge in. 
It is my opinion that we are being led 
to habits of extravagance and the result 
will be serious. It militates against us, 
and it militates against our improve- 
ment and advancement. I was think- 
ing while Brother Lund was talking 
about the poor being employed, that if 
every man and woman in the Church 
(because there are sisters that manage 
things for themselves), that are able 
would employ some one or two or more 
as their circumstances would warrant 
there would be nobody looking for 
work; everybody would be employed. 
There are people that have natural en- 
dowments enough from the Ixjrd to 
direct the labors of others to their own 
profit and to the profit of those whom 
they employ. This is a matter for con- 
sideration by those who have means, to 
employ some of our poor. In some of 
the counties they begin to feel like 
throwing the poor on the county to sup- 
port. They say: 'We pay our taxes to 
the county and the State and the poor 
should receive consideration from our 
officials in the county capacity or in 
the State capacity as the case may be. 
I do not think this is the proper thing. 
I do not think there should be anybody 
foisted upon the county for support. If 
we turn the poor off, peradventure the 
Lord will turn us off, for He said: 'The 
poor ye have always, but me ye have 
not always.' I do not believe we can 
afford to turn the poor off on the coun- 
ty for support. I believe if the Latter- 
day Saints would turn their ear to the 
Lord and listen to the counsel of His 
servants that there would be means 
provided in all the settlements of the 
Saints to provide for the poor. They 
should not be turned on the Church 
either for support, but they should be 
provided for as the Lord has directed. 
It is my firm conviction, coupled with 
my experience, that if the poor were 
properly looked after in every ward and

the people were particular to under- 
stand the necessities of the poor, every 
■ward (there may be some exceptions) 
could support its poor without turn- 
ing them on the county or Church for 
support. There are places in the 
Church where comparatively there are 
no poor. Well, the responsibility rests 
upon the people to contribute of their 
offerings for the benefit of the poor 
just as much as if they had plenty of 
poor to consume all they gave in. The 
counties have plenty of use for their 
means. "We have lived here a good 
many years and in some places it is 
difficult to travel because of the condi- 
tions of the roads and highways. The 
counties have plenty of places to put 
their means for the benefit of the great 
public. They can make our highways 
such as they are in the oldei coun- 
tries. 

I heard day before yesterday from 
an eminent financier, a remark that 
struck me with considerable force. He 
was telling me how to get out of debt. 
It may be that you would like to know, 
for I imagine ia good many of our people 
here are in debt. This brother of long 
experience, who had passed through 
the mill, told me how to get out of 
debt and how the people could get out 
of debt. I listened with a good deal 
of attention, because I thought it was 
worth something, and something that 
all of us ought to know, for a great 
many of us don't know and have it 
yet to learn. It was simply this: "Stop 
immediately from going into debt. 
Don't go into debt another dollar until 
you get out and are free." That is a 
simple way, and it might prove to be 
an easy way, too, if we would do it. 
Stop going into debt; don't buy any- 
thing you can't pay for from this time 
henceforth until it can be said, "Israel 
Is free; there is a free people, un- 
trammeled, not in bondage up there in 
the mountains; they are lenders, not 
borrowers; they will lend you money 
if you will give them good security." 
This is the situation the Lord will 
bring us to bye and bye, when He 
educates us a little further and takes 
us through the school of experience. 
We will come to this because the Lord 
has designed it. It is said that the peo- 
ple of the Lord will be a rich people. 
I believe this. I have heard promises 



from our eminent brethren of experi- 
ence to the effect that the Lord would 
help us this one time if we would 
help ourselves in the future and cease 
our habits of extravagance. Every- 
where, in all of our homes, we should 
cease these habits of extravagance; 
learn to economize; learn to save; learn 
to be prudent, wise, and judicious in 
the administration of our affairs. 

And young people that are of a mar- 
riageable age should get married. I 
don't mean to become engaged and then 
wait two or three years, or one year — to 
become engaged and think they are 
just about as good as married. I advise 
that they get married when they are of 
a proper age, and when they are mar- 
ried to cease as soon as possible to 
work for wages. Go out and do some- 
thing for yourselves. Go somewhere; 
there are many opportunities in the 
West and in the South. We receive let- 
ters from people all over the country 
telling of opportunities for young peo- 
ple to commence in life, settle down, and 
become independent; where they can 
make themselves homes and rear their 
children in the fear and admonition of 
the Lord. This idea of people always 
working for a salary with nothing else 
to depend upon, I don't believe is a good 
thing for young people. I believe they 
ought to become independent, and not 
depend always upon some one else for 
a livelihood. It is true it is very pleas- 
ant to be in the city; it is very pleasant 
to have the society there is in the city, 
and to have the amusement and the 
natural advantages that accrue to the 
people; but the question is, can you af- 
ford it as young people? I know there 
is an idea growing up in the midst of 
the young people that they can not get 
married until they have as much as 
their father or their mother; they must 
have a nice home, well furnished before 
they can take a life partner. I be-ieve 
this is wrong. I believe young people of 
a proper age ought to get married and 
they ought to depend upon themselves; 
and a young man should marry a young 
woman that is willing to put forth her 
efforts to help. Get a helpmeet; one 
that will help to make your advances in 
life; help to make you a home; help to 
sustain the family; and will do some- 
thing for the good of the community. 
This would be my advice and my coun- 



16 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



sel to our young people. Cease enter- 
taining- this idea that you cannot get 
married until you have a home furnish- 
ed and everything pertaining to it; nice 
surroundings, nice lawn and all such. 
Make the lawn yourself, and make your 
home just as beautiful as you desire. 
It is a good thing to have these sur- 
roundings; it is proper; but when it 
oomes to putting off the important 
things in life,the important matters, for 
a few years, until circum- 
stances are such that they can 
marry, I don't believe it 
is a good thing. That is the way of the 
world. They have grown up with that 
idea in our large cities. Young peo- 
ple become enamored of city life. It 
is a good thing to have cities, but it is 
a good thing for young people to re- 
flect and think over these things; and 
when they earn a dollar they should 
know how it comes. People who earn 
their money know just exactly how it 
comes, and they know better how to 
save it. These things should have the 
consideration of the young people. 
They should also be considered by 
the parents, because parents sometimes 
feel: "O, I don't want my son to go 
away off out there, and I don't want my 
daughter to go away from me and go 
out in the country somewhere;" and 
young people get discouragement many 
times from their parents. These things 
I know to be a fact, and I do not be- 
lieve they have good results. 

Our people are a growing and pros- 
perous people, and we should observe 
the counsels of the servants of God in 
regard to these things. This is a mat- 
ter that is becoming more or less in 
disuse among the Latter-day Saints — 
to listen to the whisperings of the Lord 
through His servants. I repeat, it is 
becoming more or less in disuse among 
the people! and the older ones are 
educating the young people that it is 
not so very important to listen to the 
counsels of the servants of God. But I 
want to say unto you that according to 
my education and experience in the 
Church there is no other way whereby 
we may be saved; there is no other way 
whereby we may be exalted; there is 
no other way whereby we may obtain 
eternal life. We must yield to the 
whisperings of the Holy Spirit; we 
must yield to the counsels of the Priest- 



hood, no matter what the world may 
think in regard to these things. It is a 
principle that God has established in 
the earth; God has established it and 
we can not change it. Those that will 
listen, and turn their ears to the Lord 
will be on the right side bye and bye; 
when the sheep are separated from the 
goats, those who have listened to the 
whisperings of the Lord through His 
servants will be found on the right side; 
and they will be remembered and they 
will have said to them: "Come ye 
blessed of my Father, etc." Accord- 
ing to my education and experience 
in the Church, and according to 
the teachings I have had and the 
suggestions through the inspiration of 
the Holy Ghost, there is no man, I don't 
care what his standing is; he may be 
a president of a stake, or an apostle, 
no matter, he can not safely gainsay 
the counsel of the Priesthood. If he does 
he will have it to meet some day just 
as sure as the sun rises and sets. I 
know this as well as I know that 1 
look upon this congregation. We must 
observe the will of the Lord; we must 
observe the counsels of the Priesthood, 
no matter what the world may think 
in regard to these things; and we can 
do this in all humility and maintain 
our right and manhood, and maintain 
our fellowship with each other and with 
the Lord: but when we turn away from 
these things we are like the sow that 
was washed and returned to her wal- 
lowing in the mire. The Lord has es- 
tablished His work; He is about to es- 
tablish His kingdom; He has revealed 
the everlasting Gospel; and He has 
revealed the principle by which 
you and I may go back into 
His presence; but when we 
turn a deaf ear to these things, 
through some motive or other that may 
arise in our minds, we will have to 
atone for it sooner or later. Write it 
down in your journals if you please, be- 
cause these are eternal principles of 
truth revealed to the Latter-day Saints! 
We are in advance of the world in re- 
gard to these things. The Lord has been 
merciful to us. He has given us line 
upon line, precept upon precept; here 
a little and there a little; not given it 
to us all at one time. We did not have 
everything revealed in the days of the 
Prophet Joseph; but we do not live up 



PRESIDENT GEORGE Q. CANNON. 



17 



to what was revealed in his day. There 
are a great many things revealed to His 
servants iiom time to time that imme- 
diately concern the people. Many o! 
the revelations in the Book of 
Covenants concerning the people at 
the time they were given, and 
there are revelations given that con- 
cern the people today. The Bible is an 
excellent record, a good book to study, 
a good book to become acquainted with. 
The Book of Mormon is an excellent re- 
cord, and precious truths are contained 
in it as well as the Bible, and the Book 
of Covenants is an excellent book giveiv 
from the Lord, but the whole of them 
together are not all that we need, be- 
cause as circumstances and conditions 
change with the people, the Lord has 
His mouthpiece to say what shall bt> 
done nr.d how it shall be done and on 
what occasions it shall be done. That i& 
not written perhaps at all. You may hunt 
through, and through these books, and 
you would not find what you want to 
know. What shall we do? Turn our 
ear to the Lord and to the counsels 
of His Prophet and of His servants, 
and then we will be in harmony with 
the Bible, the Book of Mormon and the 
Book of Doctrine and Covenants, and 
in harmony with the Lord; but when 
we depart from this and go astray, we 
are liable to be led into the dark, and 
when those who have been in the light 
get in the dark, u, "how great is that 
darkness!" These are matters for our 
consideration. In our secret places we 
should sit in judgment upon ourselves 
and ask ourselves such questions: How 
has been my course today; has it been 
approved of the Lord? We may know 
by the whisperings of the Holy Spirit 
whether or not our course has been ap- 
proved by the Lord; and if we feel con- 
demned, then we may know that there 
is something wrong with us. We want 
to be wise and prudent; want to be 
kind and good to one another; and learn 
to love one another; to love the Gospel 
and the work of God above everything 
else in the world. We get into a cer- 
tain groove and think we must hang 
to that groove,and we can not be pulled 
out of it. It is not a good thing for 
any of us to get into grooves. Here 
are the living oracles of the Church 
that God has placed here to regulate 
all of the affairs of the people, not only 



in spiritual things but temporal things 
as well— in building up the various cit- 
ies, in opening and developing the 
country. Who knows better than the 
Lord? And may not His servants have 
the whisperings of His Holy Spirit to 
direct them? Certainly; that is what 
the Lord has placed them in the Church 
for; and that is why we vote to sustain 
them in their position. We sustain 
the President as President of the 
Church in all the world. But how do 
we sustain him? Do we consider our 
vote? Do we consider the covenants 
we have made with the Lord when we 
turn a deaf ear to the counsels of the 
Priesthood? 

Brethren and sisters, let us be just, 
let us be true, let us be kind, and give 
to the poor; and let us pay our tithing 
as well as our offerings. This is the 
will of the Lord; and who among the 
Latter-day Saints is any poorer for 
having paid his or her tithing? No- 
body who has done this and contributed 
to the building up of the kingdom of 
God and to the spreading of the Gospel 
in various lands. Let us not forget the 
Lord in our tithes and our offerings. 
If we do, peradventure, He will for- 
get us. If we want to be remembered 
of the Lord we should remember Him 
in our tithes and our offerings; devote 
ourselves to the work of the Lord and 
the Lord will be merciful to us. 

God bless you. Amen. 

PRESIDENT GEORGE Q. CANNON. 

The great and beneficent physical and spiritual 
effects brought to the world by the organization 
of the Church. 

We have had at this Conference, so 
far, some very practical instructions 
and the Spirit of the Lord has been 
manifestly in our midst. I have had a 
good many reflections, that I hope will 
be profitable to me; and if I can relate 
some of them, I would like to do so 
this afternoon. In sitting here and con- 
templating that which has taKen place, 
and this large congregation, ihe reflec- 
tion occurs to me that this is the com- 
pletion of sixty-nine years since 
this Church was organized, since the 
Lord commenced this great work of 
which we form a part, and there are 
many interesting thoughts connected 
with this event. 



18 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



I could not help but think of pome 
of the results of this organization of 
six members into the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints sixty nine 
years ago. What has it done for the 
world? What changes have been 
wrought by the establishment of this 
Church? How much better is the world 
for its organization! How much better 
are we, who are members of this 
Church than we would have been had 
it not been organized in our day! 
Sixty-nine years ago but little or noth- 
ing was known about God. Communi- 
cation between heaven and earth had 
entirely ceased. Every popular minis- 
ter, and every man of science, every 
man that made any pretension to edu- 
cation, declared at that time that God 
had ceased to talk to man; that all 
communication between heaven and 
earth had been entirely cut off; that 
God had spoken eighteen hundred years 
before and had revealed His will, but 
since then He had remaitied silent. No 
man had heard His voice; no man bad 
beheld His person; no man had received 
communication from Him; but all' were 
left to wander as they pleased, to be 
guided by that which had been written 
so long before. The personality of God 
Himself was unknown. Extraordinary 
ideas prevailed as to the character of 
our God. That which had been written 
in the Scriptures concerning Him had 
been looked upon as spiritual; to be 
spiritualized and not real. He was de- 
clared not to be a personage of taber- 
nacle, not to be able to walk, nor to 
talk, nor to hear, having none 
of these organs by which com- 
munication was had; but that He 
was a spirit, diffused through 
space. The most extraordinary ideas 
prevailed on this subject. The commu- 
nication of the Gospel of the Lord Jesus 
Christ dissipated that ignorance; it 
gave to mankind a knowledge of God; 
it restored to the earth the gifts and 
graces of the Gospel; it removed doubt 
concerning the plan of salvation; it re- 
vealed clearly the ordinances, by obe- 
dience to which man could be saved. It 
has had the effect of bringing the Gos- 
pel, the word of God, the salvation of 
God, to the poorest and to the humblest 
on the earth. 

We heard this morning about class 
distinctions. No power could have been 



more effective in leveling class distinc- 
tions, and it may be said in destroying 
them, than the revelation of this Gos- 
pel and the establishment of this 
Church. The thousands who have heard 
the Gospel in various lands, in lands of 
oppression, in the midst of poverty and 
destitution and hopelessness, where 
there was no prospect before them and 
their children, only to toil and live lives 
of drudgery, of poverty and deprivation 
— the thousands who in this condition 
have heard the message of salvation 
have had their hearts gladdened; it has 
been an emancipation for them, or a 
means of emancipation to deliver them 
from these sad and disheartening cir- 
cumstances, because this brought to 
them a knowledge that they were the 
children of God, equally valuable, it 
may be said, equally esteemed in the 
presence of God with those who pos- 
sessed so many advantages over them. 
The toiler in Europe, the man working 
in the mines in England or in Scotland, 
the toiler in Germany and in Scandina- 
via — these men so low that they were 
almost deprived of all hope, have heard 
the Gospel. It has come as a salvation 
to them and a means of deliverance. I 
heard one man say, who is now a Bish- 
op in the north, that in Scandinavia, 
where he lived, he envied the posi- 
tion of the horse, and wished he had 
been born a horse. Why? Because the 
horse was cared for; the horse was fed; 
the horse was carefully housed; he had 
value; when he died it was a loss to his 
master; but as to him, the working 
man, he might die, and what loss would 
it be to anybody? Not to his master. It 
might be to his wife, or to his children, 
but not to his master. He could toil, 
could go hungry; he could go partly 
clad; he could go miserably housed and 
provided for; the animal that 
possessed value was worth something; 
that could be cared for, carefully 
blanketed at night, fed well and kept 
in a warm stable, and if he were sick 
taken care of that he might not die. 
This man's statement concerning his 
feelings was very_ strongly put; but 
his condition was that of thousands 
when this Gospel reached them. What 
has it done for them? It has lifted them 
up; it has made them feel that they 
are the children of God — peers of every 
one else on the earth, no matter how 



PRESIDENT GEORGE Q. CANNON 



19 



rich, no matter how learned, no matter 
how many advantages others may pos- 
sess, tney are equal before the Lord 
with all of them. "Mormonism" has 
done this for the world. It has made 
every man, that is worthy, a Priest of 
God; it has had this effect. You have 
heard talk today about prophets; you 
have heard talk about oracles; you 
have heard talk about leaders and men 
being entrusted with authority; but 
there is nothing that is said about an> 
one of these that does not apply to every 
man in this Church. Every man thai 
has embraced this Gospel is raised to 
this dignity and to this power. There- 
fore, this Church has been a great 
blessing to the poor of every land. 
Those who have heard this Gospel have 
been delivered by it from their bond- 
age and from their oppression, and they 
are brought to a land of liberty where 
they can receive of the benefits that 
liner tv bestows and all of the advant- 
ages which the Lord has promised to 
the inhabitants of this land. These, my 
brethren and sisters, are some of the 
blessings that have flowed to us in 
sixtj'-nine years. 

When I reflect upon all of the conse- 
quences that have followed that great 
and important event, although so little 
noticed \yy the world, my mind fails to 
grasp it in all its details, the benefits 
are so numerous. They extend in so 
many directions, not only to us who 
have received this Gospel, but to the 
world at large. They feel the effect of 
it. Contemplate the condition of tht. 
world when this Gospel was restored! 
What was known about heaven? What 
was known about hell? There are two 
places, one of bliss, the other a place of 
torment. How much terror was enter- 
tained by the people at large con- 
cerning this place of torment. To have 
to think that this was endless; to think 
how the hearts of mothers were wrung 
with anguish at the death of their 
wayward children, of their loved ones, 
when they were told by men who as- 
sumed authority and to whom they had 
been taught to look with respect, that 
they were eternally damned — sent to a 
place of torment worlds without end! 
Think of the misery of human souls in 
contemplating such fearful results! Is 
it any wonder that men wished they 
had never been born? They did not 



know what to do. Suicide brought no 
relief; they could not get deliverance 
from the inexorable consequences of 
living, because their souls were indes- 
tructible. They could not hope to es- 
cape from the justice of God, go 
where they might. And this feeling of 
hopelessness and misery filled thous- 
ands of bosoms, millions, I may say; 
but what did this Gospel do? It brought 
light from God, the author of our being. 
Instead of thinking it was a bad con- 
dition to be born, it produced a feeling 
of gladness in the hearts of men and 
women that they ever had been born; 
because when they saw the justice of 
God, that they would get rewarded ac- 
cording to the deeds done in the body,, 
all fear vanished, for they would be 
dealt with by a just and merciful God 
and not a tyrant, such as the world 
described the Lord to be. 

Not only this, but think of the glad 
tidings of salvation that have come to 
us through the revelations that God has 
given to this Church respecting the 
dead and their future fate. Before, 
the popular idea was that the unnum- 
bered millions of heathen who had died 
in ignorance of the Gospel had been 
sent to this endless place of torment; 
that they were sent to hell without any 
hope of deliverance through the endless 
ages of eternity. The feeling of those 
who would dare think upon this subject, 
when such thoughts were presented to 
them, was only to hate, as a monster, 
the God who would do such things. 
What could be more monstrous than to 
send innocent people to hell for not be- 
ing that which they knew nothing of? 
No wonder that men revolted at the 
thought. No wonder that men defied 
the Almighty under such misconcep- 
tions. The Gospel has brought to us 
revelations concerning this. We see 
our God in all His beauty; in all His 
grandeur; clothed with all those at- 
tributes that call forth our highest ad- 
miration and worship. We can worship 
Him in spirit and in truth. 

What has the organization of this 
Church done for us in regard to the 
future? Why, heaven is no longer a 
place that is vague and indefinite in 
our minds, or in the minds of the chil- 
dren of men to whom revelation has 
come. Heaven is something to be de- 
sired; not to sit idly and play upon

golden harps; but heaven is a place of 
activity, a place of progress; that which 
furnishes man his highest enjoyment on 
the earth; that which develops and 
calls out his highest and noblest qual- 
ities, we are to have in heaven. And this 
is no new revelation; but it is beclouded 
and misunderstood by the world. 
"Thou hast been faithful over a few 
things, I will make thee ruler over 
many," the Scriptures say. "What does 
that mean? That the man who has 
done his duty in his sphere here on the 
earth faithfully will have an enlarged 
sphere hereafter; will have greater 
power, more opportunities for develop- 
ment; shall have every God-like power; 
every power and attribute that we 
have derived from our ancestry— that 
is, from God our Eternal Father. We 
shall have room for infinite gratifica- 
tion, unlimited gratification, going on 
from one degree of power to another, 
and exercising it as our Father exercises 
it in the midst of the eternities. Is 
there not something delightful in this 
thought, and in the contemplation of 
such a future? If I have children; if I 
have a wife, I shall have them in 
eternity. I shall preside over that fam- 
ily no matter how small it may be, or 
how large it may extend. They will 
be my kingdom; for this is the promise 
of God. What is there that is more de- 
lightful in the contemplation of the fu- 
ture than this thought, that those with 
whom we are associated here, with 
whom our lives and happiness is en- 
twined; who give unto us the greatest 
pleasure, because of the love we have 
for them and they have for us; that 
that union shall be perpetuated 
throughout eternity, and that there 
shall be an increase of that love and of 
that union and an increase also of that 
power, because the power of procreation 
is promised — the greatest power that 
man possesses on the earth. That is 
promised unto those who are faithful. 
I know the world say this is material- 
istic; that we take wrong views of 
this; that we are not spiritual enough. 
Well, I am willing to have that 
charge levelled against me. I want 
to be materialistic in this sense. 
I want to enjoy that which we enjoy 
here, purified, exalted, and increased 
beyond my comprehension or your com- 
prehension at the present time; and 



we are to have this glory and this 
power; the Lord promises it unto us. 
Therefore, it can be said of us as it 
was said of our Lord and Savior, "to 
the increase of His kingdom there shall 
be no end." Why? Because of this 
principle that I spoke of— the principle 
of procreation. By it, and through 
that principle the worlds are peopled. 
The planetary orbs which stud our 
heavens so gloriouslv are peopled by 
that principle— the principle of pro- 
creation. God possesses it, and we as 
His children inherit the power. If we 
do what is right He promises to bestow 
it upon us. Our heaven, then, is ma- 
terialistic in this sense; it is not al- 
together spiritual. But it is spiritual 
also. We shall have spiritual joy; we 
shall have spiritual pleasures such as 
have been described to us this day, for 
it is the highest pleasure or joy the 
human soul is capable of, to worship 
God, to do His will, keep His com- 
mandments and to serve Him. This 
is the highest pleasure that human be- 
ings can attain unto, and we shall have 
it in eternity, and it shall be the chief 
source of our enjoyment and of our 
happiness in the world to come. 

These are a few of the blessings that 
have come to us through the revela- 
tion of the Gospel and the organization 
of the Church sixty-nine years ago 
today. Think of it! What happiness 
it has brought to us individually! Each 
man and each woman in this congrega- 
tion could tell this for himself or her- 
self. Each one could reflect upon the 
benefits that have flowed to him or her 
individually. Contemplate the great- 
ness of the work, the effect of the work 
tipon the whole world wherever this 
Gospel has been preached, and it has 
been carried to many lands. It has 
brought release to many cap- 
tives; it has gladdened the hearts 
of the people of the civilized 
nations. It has reached even the 
barbarians, and it has gladdened 
their hearts. It has inspire.! the hearts 
of our Indian races with new hope, for 
they have had presented to them the 
promises of God made to their fathers, 
and they look forward to their ful- 
fillment, and they look forward 
with joy to their redemption

time has not yet come for them to 
embrace it. Still, it comes with the 
promise.and filled with the hope to these 
scattered remnants of the House of Is- 
real, these despised people who are 
persecuted in lands of civilization, be- 
cause they are assured that the prom- 
ises concerning' them and their restora- 
tion to their ancient land will be ful- 
filled. It has brought hope to the 
islands of the Pacific, to those despised 
races who have before them extinction 
unless this Gospel saves them; and it 
has filled them with hope and anticipa- 
tion. In fact, it has gladdened the 
hearts of the people of every land who 
have heard the glad tidings of salvation. 
It has had more to do to dissipate ig- 
norance and to save mankind than any 
other agency that has ever existed 
among the inhabitants of the earth 
since the days of the Redeemer. We 
can well spend money to send our mis- 
sionaries with such glad tidings as they 
are to bear. We can do this freely, be- 
cause the results are such as to gladden 
us and to make us rejoice that we have 
the opportunity of doing this. I would 
like to send every son I have, if cir- 
cumstances would permit, to the world 
to deliver the glad tidings of salvation; 
to relate to the people of the world 
what God has done in the earth during 
these many years, commencing as it 



were in a small place, in a corner, and 
gradually spreading. "Light broke 
forth in darkness," as we are told it 
should do. It has broken forth, and it 
gradually spreading. As is written: 
"A light shall break forth among 
them that sit in darkness." It 
has broken forth, and it has 
spread gradually, is spreading grad- 
ually and illumining a larger circle, 
spreading into many lands and will 
continue until it will enlighten the 
whole earth. The light of' this Gospel, 
the power of this salvation, the extent 
and future of this work, and the knowl- 
edge of it, will spread from land to 
land, from nation to nation, from kin- 
dred to kindred, until it will embrace 
the wnole of the inhabitants of the 
earth; and they will see it and under- 
stand it and the prophecies and prom- 
ises of God will every one be fulfilled 
concerning this work which He has es- 
tablished. 

That God may bless us; that we may 
be true and faithful; that we may have 
wisdom to do as we should do; that we 
may continue faithful and forget world- 
ly things, is my prayer in the name of 
the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem, 

Light and truth.

SECOND DAY. 



Friday, April 7th, 10 a. m. 
The choir and congregation sang the 
hymn which begins: 

Redeemer of Israel, 
Our only delight. 

Prayer by Elder David H. Cannon. 
Singing by the choir: 

All hail the glorious day, 

By Prophets long foretold, 
When with harmonious lay, 
The sheep of Israel's fold 
On Zion's hill His praise proclaim, 
And shout hosanna to His name. 

PRESIDENT LORENZO SNOW. 

I am very much pleased to meet with 
the brethren and sisters and our friends 
"this morning. We have another beau- 
tiful day, like yesterday, and I hope 



that the Latter-day Saints feel happy. 
We had an excellent meeting yesterday. 
The spirit of the Lord was with us 
greatly; the most excellent ideas and 
suggestions were made to us by the 
different speakers; the beauties and 
glories of what the Lord has accom 
plished already, and those we antici- 
pate and are sure He will accomplish 
in the future, were clearly portrayed 
before us. 

If we will be as quiet as we were yes- 
terday and exercise faith we will have 
just as good a meeting today and the 
Spirit of the Lord will inspire the 
speakers. 

We have invited the Salt Lake Tem- 
ple choir to be with us during tht. 
remaining part of our conference and it

will be called upon occasionally to in- 
terest the Latter-day Saints. We think 
they will be pleased with this oppor- 
tunity of hearing this choir, which has 
been employed in the Temple here for 
about six years. 

Brethren and sisters, God bless you 
and pour out His spirit upon us this 
day, that we may greatly rejoice, is m> 
prayer, in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER JOHN W. TAYLOR. 

Restoration of the Gospel and the obligation to 
preach it— Missionary work in Colorado and 
adjacent districts— Promises of the Lord ful- 
filled—Signs follow the believer— Beneficial ef- 
fects of opposition— The Kingdom to cover the 
earth. 

I am requested to make a few re- 
marks this morning, and I ask an inter- 
est in the faith and prayers of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints and their friends, that 
what I may say might be dictated by 
the Spirit of God, because I feel that 
where a man speaks under that influ- 
ence he will always speak right, and 
when he does not speak under that in- 
fluence he will always speak wrong. 

You are no doubt aware that 1 have 
been away from you for a little time 
in the State of Colorado preaching the 
Gospel. I do not think I could say any- 
thing more appropriate this morning 
than to dwell a little while upon the 
missionary labors in that district, as 
there are many here whose sons are 
in that land spreading the truth. We 
all heard the very interesting remarks 
yesterday of President Cannon regard- 
ing the restoration of the Gospel to the 
children of men, and its effects upon us. 
Inasmuch as the Gospel has been re- 
stored it has become our duty to preach 
it in all the world, for a witness unto 
all nations. The words of Jesus Christ 
are fulfilled, for in His day He said, 
speaking of the Gospel, "The kingdom 
of God shall be taken from among you 
and it shall be given unto a people 
bringing forth the fruits thereof." Af- 
ter Christ was put to death, Peter, af- 
ter the Savior had been resur- 
rected, asked Him the question: 
"Comest thou again to restore 
the kingdom to Israel?" Jesus 
had taught them to pray in this wise: 
"Our Father who art in heaven, Thy 
kingdom come, Thy will be done on 



earth as it is in heaven, etc." And 
they were praying for the kingdom to 
come, but when Jesus answered Peter 
regarding this question, He said: "It 
is not for you to know the times and 
the seasons." Now, today all of the sec- 
tarian world, are praying for the king- 
dom of God to come upon the earth. 
President Cannon announced yesterday 
that the Gospel of Jesus Christ had 
been restored in its fulness to the 
Prophet Joseph Smith; that the day had 
arrived which had been spoken of by 
the prophets, and which all the holy 
prophets since the world began de- 
sired to live in, even the time of the 
restitution of all things. Inasmuch as 
the Gospel had been restored in these 
last days, we have also received the same 
injunction that was received in former 
days, for Jesus said unto them: "Go 
ye into all the world and preach the 
Gospel to every creature." We have re- 
ceived the same commandment in our 
day. Jesus said: "He that believeth 
and is baptized shall be saved, and he 
that believeth not shall be damned." It 
was only a short time ago that an emi- 
nent evangelist announced from this 
stand that ordinances were unnecessary- 
such as baptism, etc., for salvation. But 
God the Eternal Father has given the 
same injunction in this our day as He 
gave in the days of Christ and His 
Apostles, and when we go forth, we say 
unto them: "He that believeth and is 
baptized shall be saved, and he that 
believeth not shall be damned." These 
are the words which we speak unto the 
children of men. Jesus spake further 
and He said: "In my name they shall 
speak with new tongues: they shall 
lay hands on the sick and they shall 
recover; if they drink any deadly thing 
it shall not hurt them, etc." We promise 
the people these same blessings today. 

There are about thirty of us out in 
the Colorado mission today. We are 
at present branching out into New 
Mexico, the northern part of Arizona, 
and in Wyoming a little. The Lord 
has blessed us, and He has prospered 
our labors. We have an excellent lot 
of young men out there preaching the 
Gospel. We preach in the old-fashioned 
way, without purse or scrip; and they 
feed us, and they clothe us, and they 
give us money, and we are blessed ot 
the Lord. And those Elders whose par- 



ELDER JOHA W. TAYLOR. 



32 



ents can not afford to send them money 
are the best missionaries we have in 
the field. It is an injury to keep send- 
ing your sons money, because they be- 
gin to depend upon the money instead 
of the Lord. In olden times the Gospel 
was preached according to this coun- 
sel: Jesus says, "He that receiveth 
you receiveth me, and he that receiveth 
me receiveth Him that sent me, and 
he that receiveth a prophet in the name 
of a prophet shall receive a prophet's 
reward, and he that giveth drink, even 
as much as a cup of cold water to one 
of these little ones of mine, shall in no 
wise lose his reward." These were the 
qualifications of the servants of Goa 
in the days of Jesus, and today we 
possess the same qualifications, and we 
receive the same instructions. Jesus 
says, "Freely ye have received, freely 
give," or in other words the Gospel 
cost you nothing, do not charge other 
people anything for it. This peculiar 
means of preaching the Gospel is the 
test Christ is going to make of the 
children of men whether they receive 
the truth or not, for He said— you will 
find it in the 25th chapter of Matthew— 
"When I come in all my glory and all 
my holy angels with me and I sit upon 
my throne of glory, T will separate the 
goats from the sheep; I will set the 
sheep on my right hand and the goats 
on my left hand; and to the "-oats 
upon my left hand, I will say: I was 
sick and in prison and ye visited me 
not; I was naked and ye clothed me 
not; T was hungry and ye fed me not. 
And they will say: when wast thou 
an hungered and thirsty, or naked, or 
in prison, and we came not unto ye? 
I will say inasmuch as ye did it unto 
even one of these my brethren, ye did 
it also to me. And to those upon ray 
right hand I will say, that inasmuch aa 
ye have ministered unto one of these 
of my brethren, ye have ministered unto 
me. Enter thou into the place pre 
pared for thee before the foundations 
of the world." I say this is the was 
Christ is going to judge the world, foi 
He gave a special commandment that 
when you should go into a house or a 
city you should enquire who is worthy 
to receive you, and if they do so, let 
your peace rest upon that household and 
say unto them, "the kingdom of God 
is nigh unto you; but if they reject you 



shake the dust off your feet as a testi- 
mony against them, for it shall be 
more tolerable in the day of judgment 
for the city of Sodom or Gomorrha 
than for that city or household that re- 
jecteth you." 

This is the course we pursue in 
preaching the everlasting Gospel and 
the Lord has blessed the labors of the 
young men and has led them to the 
honest in heart. Some 260 or 270 have 
been baptized, and we have organized 
branches of the Church in Denver, in 
Colorado Springs, Pueblo, near Duran- 
go, and we have members of the 
Church in Grand Valley, and a numbei 
of other places. Our brethren are labor- 
ing diligently, and they are being re- 
ceived kindly by the people of Colorado. 
The people there are similar to those 
here. They have had the courage and 
fortitude to get out of the crowded cit- 
ies of the East and come West, and 
wherever their lot is cast they are till- 
ing *.he soil, raising cattle, horses and 
sheep, and going down into the bowelo 
of the earth and mining, and they 
are a prosperous and big-hearted peo- 
ple. We went there a little less than 
two and a half years ago, when we were 
without a friend, and we have been 
blessed and prospered, and the Lord 
has verified His promises in our be- 
half. He says, "I will send mine an- 
gels before your face to prepare the 
way before you, and I will be upon your 
right hand and upon your* left hand 
and bear you up." Has this been veri- 
fied? Yes. He says further, When 
you lay hands upon the children of 
men, I will cause that the Holy Ghost 
shall descend upon them." Has this 
been verified? It has. And, also, the 
blessings of the Gospel which is not in 
the power of man to confer upon the 
children of men, because every good 
and perfect gift comes from God. We 
have enjoyed the gift of tongues; we 
have enjoyed the gift of prophecy; and 
we have enjoyed the gift of interpreta- 
tion of tongues; and we have enjoyed 
that knowledge promised by our Lord 
and Savior Jesus Christ, when He says, 
"He that doeth the will of my Father 
shall know of the doctrine whether I 
speak of God or whether I speak of 
myself." Has God verified this unto 
the children of men? He has. And 
there are those under the sound of my 



GEhERAL CONFERENCE 



voice on whom these young Elders, of 
whom I have been speaking-, have laid 
their hands upon, and they received 
the Holy Ghost, and they could testi- 
fy that what I say is true. This is the 
foundation of the kingdom of God— 
the testimony of Jesus Christ. It is 
the same today as it was in the days 
of the ancient Apostles. The Savior 
thought He would find out whether 
Peter had a testimony or not, and He 
said, "Peter, whom do men say that I 
the Son of Man am?" Peter said, 
"Some say that thou art Jonas, others 
Elias, others one of the old prophets 
raised from the dead." But, said the 
Savior, "whom sayest thou that I am?" 
He wanted to know what Peter thought 
of this. Peter answered, being filled 
with the Holy Ghost: "Thou art Christ 
the Son of the living God." And Jesus 
blessed him, and said, "Flesh and blood 
hath not revealed this unto thee, but 
my Father who is in heaven, and upon 
this rock will I build my church (the 
rock of revelation) and the gates of 
hell shall not prevail against it." Is this 
correct? It is correct. This is why 
the persecution of the Latter-day 
Saints only increases their numbers. 

At present we have a considerable 
agitation against this people regarding 
political matters. I have noticed, as 
president of the Colorado mission, that 
according to the reports from our 
Elders our meetings have double the 
number of .attendants that they had be- 
fore this agitation, and they sell double 
the amount of Church literature that 
they did before. And I wish to tell the 
Latter-day Saints present that it is not 
only the converts of this people that 
are our friends. When we went into 
Colorado we were entire strangers, but 
after we began to lift up our voices, 
we found many friends. Many are 
friendly that do not care, for special 
reasons, to have it announced. I have 
had conferred upon me all manner of 
favors and courtesies by friends that 
have been raised up of God; the peo^ 
pie are friendly to us — those who see 
what has been done by the people who 
inhabit these rocky mountains from 
Mexico to Canada, and who have made 
a sterile desert to blossom as the rose. 
Today I could take a buggy in the 
northern or western part of the State 
of Colorado and travel from one end to 



the other and stop every night with a 
friend of the Latter-day Saints. "While 
we have probably 260 converts, we have 
thousands and thousands of friends 
raised up by the Lord. My testimony 
to you is that there is not one man out 
of a hundred, when he hears this Gos- 
pel preached in its purity, but what 
says , in his heart, "that is true," but 
he has not the moral stamina to em- 
brace it; but he has the courage to pro- 
vide for our wants, and they do it free- 
ly. I rejoice in this labor in connection 
with my young brethren. I can do but 
little. One man can do but little in this 
great world of ours, it is so large. Our 
labors are confined to a very narrow 
compass, but nevertheless we can all do 
something. I can say, in connection 
with my brethren, that the Lord has 
blessed us in our labors. I have been 
blessed and have felt free in my spirit, 
that is, as free as it is possible for a 
man to be who is laboring under a bur- 
den of debt as I am and away from 
home principally and with no oppor- 
tunities to satisfy my creditors. But 
having been called by the servants of 
God to go and preach the Gospel, I go 
forth and do the best I can, knowing 
that God will overrule all things 
for my good in so doing. In the various 
nations of the earth the Lord is bless- 
ing the brethren; He is verifying His 
promises to the children of men. 

I know that this is the work of God; 
I know that the Lord has again estab- 
lished His work in the day and age in 
which you and I live, and I know that 
every man that will humble himself 
and go. down into the waters of baptism 
with a desire to serve God and keep 
His commandments, rorsttklng all his 
sins, that he will receive the gift of 
the Holy Ghost when the hands of the 
servants of God are laid upon him; he 
will know that God lives and that 
Joseph Smith was a Prophet of God, as 
you and I know it, because we have 
been founded upon the rock of revela- 
tion. We have received the spirit which 
takes of the things of the Father and 
reveals them unto the children of men, 
and we have a perfect knowledge that 
God lives. That is what inspires this 
people through all the troubles and 
vicissitudes of life which they have had 
to endure since the year 1830. That is 
why we feel that we "are not ashamed

of the Gospel of Christ, for it is the 
power of God unto salvation unto all 
those who believe and obey it, for 
therein is the righteousness of God re- 
vealed from faith to faith. As it is 
written, "the just shall live by faith." 
"We live in a day of revelation; we live 
in a day when no man neea be in the 
dark; we live in a day when no man, 
if he be humble and faithful, need 
say "know ye the Lord, for all shall 
know Him." All can have a testimony 
of these things, as God is no respecter 
of persons. 

I feel to rejoice in the large attend- 
ance at this grand conference. I know 
that our first aim and object should be, 
the kingdom of God or nothing. I be- 
lieve it is the desire of this people as a 
rule, that this kingdom shall roll forth 
until it shall cover the whole earth. 
There was a great and mighty prophet 
that lived in olden times by the name 
of Daniel, who prophesied that the 
Lord would set up a kingdom that 
would never be destroyed or given into 
the hands of another people. It was 
like unto a little stone cut out of 
the mountain without hands, and 
it would roll forth until it 
should cover the whole earth. 
Is this little stone rolling forth? Yes. 
Will this be its destiny? It will. Will 
you and I endure with it? That de- 
pends upon whether we keep the com- 
mandments of God or not, and whether 
we keep our garments pure and un- 
spotted from the pins of this wicked 
and adulterous generation in which we 
live. Malachi says, "Behold the Lord, 
whom ye seek shall suddenly come to 
His Temple; but who may abide the 
day of His coming, and who shall stand 
when He appeareth? For He is like a 
refiner's fire and like fullers' soap?" 
Who will stand when He appeareth? 
It will be those who have their lamps 
filled with oil— the oil of the Holy 
Ghost. Those who have this Spirit and 
are walking in the ways of rectitude 
and are obedient to the commandments 
of God will be prepared for the coming 
of Jesus Christ, for He will come to 
purify the sons of Levi as gold, seven 
times purified in the fire. Are we pre- 
pared for this test? We may be if we 
will improve a little day by day. I 
know as far as I am concerned there is 
great room for improvement, and I 



hope that you can see that there is 
some room for improvement with you. 
I know that God loves those that are 
humble and contrite in their spirit. I 
know that God loves those who work 
for the redemption of mankind. I know 
God loves, and is pleased with, His chil- 
dren whose greatest desire is to build 
up His kingdom here on the earth — who 
are energetic, and he blesses them with 
His Spirit. We hear remarks some- 
times by some of our cold-blooded peo- 
ple. They will say, "He is enthusias- 
tic." There never was a man who spoke 
by the power of the Holy Ghost but 
what he was enthusiastic. The black- 
smith never made a weld until the 
white sparks began to fly. I know that 
the children of men never were convert- 
ed until they saw that the power of God 
rested with His servants, and the Spirit 
of God went down into their hearts like 
fire. John said, "I baptize you with 
water, but there is one coming after me 
who will baptize you with fire and with 
the Holy Ghost." Has that fire been 
given unto this people? It has. How 
were your bosoms swelled with joy, 
when you heard the sound of the ever- 
lasting Gospel! It has the same effect 
wherever the elders of Israel go, be- 
cause they know they are servants of 
God. "My sheep hear my voice," but the 
stranger will not because he does not 
know His voice. "When a servant 
of God enters a house and says by the 
authority of the Priesthood, "peace be 
unto this house," does peace rest upon 
it? Yes. I heard a woman testify 
that Brother Franklin D. Richards en- 
tered her house in Illinois and said in 
a humble, gentle spirit, "peace be unto 
this house," and the moment he spake 
those words the spirit of God came up- 
on her and went through her whole sys- 
tem from the crown of her head to 
the soles of her feet, and such peace 
and such joy she never had experi- 
enced. This is what was spoken of by 
Christ: "Peace on earth, good will to 
to man." It was the spirit of God that 
bore testimony to that woman that 
Brother Richards was a servant of God. 
It is the spirit of God that converts the 
people. There never was a man that 
converted another man to the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ. It is impossible; it is the 
spirit of God that converts men. Every 
conversion that has ever been made in

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the Church of Christ has been made by 
God, otherwise they will not endure. 
That which has not been sealed by the 
Holy Spirit of promise will not be en- 
during, but will pass away. 

I rejoice in preachng the everlasting 
Gospel; and I rejoice in being with you 
here in the land of Zion. I can see 
that Zion is prospering, and growing, 
and that the blessings of God are upon 
her from the north to the south, and 
from the east to the west; and I hope 
she shall continue to grow and spread 
until all shall be accomplished that 
God desires we shall accomplish; that 
the blessings of God will rest upon her 
sons and upon her daughters; that they 
may build upon that sure foundation of 
truth, that the towers of Zion may rise 
and shine until she becomes the glory 
of the Avhole earth. God is directing 
this work, and is directing His servants. 
I know that His servants are inspired 
by the gifts and powers of God to coun- 
sel this people in the ways of truth and 
righteousness; and He will inspire 
every man acording to his station and 
circumstances in life if he will yield 
obedience to His commandments. 

May God bless you in all of your af- 
fairs; may He temper the elements for 
your good, that Zion may grow and be- 
come the pride of the whole earth, is 
my prayer in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER HEBER J. GRANT. 

Nothing can be attempted against the work of God 
that will not advance it— Futility of seeking 
to convert apostates— A. prophesy fulfilled— The 
leaven of the Gospel in the world. 

It is a source of great pleasure to 
me to meet once more with the Latter- 
day Saints in a general conference of 
the Church. I have listened with very 
much interest and pleasure to the re- 
marks that have been made by those 
who have spoken thus far in our meet- 
ings. In standing before you this morn- 
ing to bear witness of the goodness of 
the Lord to His people and to me as 
an individual, I desire most earnestly 
and humbly that what I may say may 
be for our mutual benefit; that it may 
strengthen us in our desires to serve 
God and keep His commandments. If 
I know my own heart, I believe it is 
set upon the advancement of the 
Church and Kingdom of God. I know 



that there is nothing on the earth that 
I rejoice over so much as I do in the 
fact that I am associated with the ser- 
vants and handmaidens of God in the 
Church of Jesus Christ; and I do not 
believe that there ever is a day that 
passes over my head that I do not 
thank God for the restoration again of 
the plan of life and salvation, and that 
I have been made a partaker of the 
same. I supplicate Him earnestly that 
my mind may never become darkened, 
that I may never depart from the truth; 
that I may never forget any of the 
covenants that I have made, but. as I 
grow in years and increase in un- 
derstanding, that I may grow in 
a testimony of the Gospel and 
in the desire — not only a desire but in 
doing it — to labor for the onward ad- 
vancement of the Kingdom of God on 
the earth. 

When I look around and see the mis- 
takes that I have made, and those that 
my brethren make from time to time; 
when I realize how many of those who 
have been wonderfully blessed of the 
Lord have fallen by the wayside, it fills 
me with humility; it fills me with the 
spirit of meekness and with an earnest 
desire that I may ever seek to know 
the mind and the will of God and to 
keep His commandments rather than 
to follow out my own desires. 

In listening to the remarks that have 
been made here this morning by Bro- 
ther John W. Taylor with regard to the 
political agitation that is being stirred 
up, or at least the agitation that is 
being stirred up because of the politi- 
cal affairs in Utah, and his testimony 
that the meetings held by the Elders 
are doubly as well attended as they 
were before this agitation; and that 
they are now selling double the amount 
of tracts to what they did before this 
agitation, it furnished one more testi- 
mony to :ne of the truth of the sayings 
of those who have been inspired: 
"that nothing can be done against the 
work of God but what shall redound to 
its advancement." I have recently had 
the privilege of visiting three of the 
conferences in the Northern States mis- 
sion, and we had exactly the same ex- 
perience as that related by Brother 
Taylor. Some of the first meetings 
were very poorly attended, but when it 
was announced that some remarks 



ELDER HEBER J. GRANT. 



27 



would be made at a later meeting by 
myself upon what is known as the 
Roberts' case, we had a full house and 
we had a chance to say a few words 
with regard to the Roberts' case and 
a great many words with regard to the 
restoration of the Gospel and to bear 
witness that Joseph Smith was a pro- 
phet of the true and living God. 

Never have I rejoiced more in my 
life, that my lot has been cast among 
the Latter-day Saints, that I have been 
born in the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints, than I did in mj. 
recent visit to the East, when I came 
in contact with members of the Re- 
organized church. When I visited Kirt- 
land, Ohio, and saw there the temple, 
and realized the fact that at the time 
it was erected by the Prophet Joseph 
and his brother, that it was a mighty 
work; when I considered the ordin- 
ances that aro being performed in our 
temples here in Utah; when I reflected 
that we have the Gospel in its fulness; 
when I thought that they have the tem- 
ple but know not how to put it to any 
use; when I realized that they are ab- 
solutely devoid of the inspiration of 
God, I rejoiced that my lot had beeiv 
cast among the Later-day Saints. 

I have often been surprised that so 
much of the time of our Elders has 
been wasted in the world in discussing 
with members of the Re-organized 
Church as to which Church was in very 
deed the Church of Christ. I have been 
astonished at this for the reason that 
it seems to me an utter waste of time 
to undertake to discuss with a man af- 
ter you have knocked him down as to 
who holds the ground. We read that in 
heaven there was a rebellion and that 
God, our Heavenly Father, cast out 
one-third of the hosts of heaven with 
Lucifer at their head. We have no ac- 
count after they were cast out that 
God stopped to argue the question with 
those that had been cast out as to who 
held the ground. In the Re-organized 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints, about one-half, if not more, of 
its members, are those who have been 
cast out of the real Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints. They do 
not begin to have one-tenth the number 
we have, and why should we waste 
our time in arguing with them as to 
who holds the situation, and as to 



which is the Church of Christ? If the 
prophecies of Daniel and others 
that have been referred to here 
today are true, and we know 
they are true, then is the moun- 
tain of the Lord's house to be estab- 
lished in the tops of the mountains? 
Here it is, and here it is rolling forth 
and will fill the whole earth. Can any 
of these claims be made by this shad- 
dow, so to speak, of a re-organized 
church? We know that Joseph prophe- 
sied that the Latter-day Saints should 
be driven from city to city; that they 
should be driven from county to coun- 
ty; and that they should be driven 
from state to state; and finally, that 
they should be driven out of the con- 
fines of the United States to these 
Rocky Mountains and become a great, 
a prosperous, a mighty people. We 
know that this has been fulfilled to the 
letter. The Re-organized Church can 
lay no claims to being persecuted and 
driven from city to city, from county 
to county, from state to state, or of 
being driven to the Rocky Mountains. 
They have not become a mighty people 
in the midst of the Rocky Mountains. 
Not only did Joseph Smith proclaim 
that the day should come when a city, 
a county, and a state should be ar- 
rayed against this people called Latter- 
day Saints, but he said, "the time shall 
ome when the whole United States 
shall be arrayed against the Mor- 
mons;" and the day did come. I re- 
member in my childhood days when the 
army of the United States came 
against this people. Not a state militia, 
but the army of the United States of 
America. I remember very well also 
that the property of the Church of Je- 
sus Christ of Latter-day Saints was 
confiscated. I remember to have picked 
up the papers time and time again at 
the time the confiscation suits were go- 
ing on in this state, and read in bold 
headlines, "The United States of Ameri- 
ca, vs the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints," and I have laid 
down the paper and said, "thanks be to 
God our Heavenly Father, that the 
United States of America has placed 
the stamp of divinity upon the utter- 
ances of the Prophet Joseph Smith." 
Every one of these predictions of the 
Prophet Joseph Smith have utterly 
failed if there is one claim that 



2s 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



amounts to anything in the claims of 
the Re-organized Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints, because 
the United States of America has never 
lifted its hand nor sent its army against 
or confiscated the property of the Re-or- 
ganized Church. Never has one thing 
been done by the United States of 
America against that church. 

I rejoice, as I have said, that I have 
been born among the Latter-day 
Saints. I rejoice in the growth and in 
the advancement of the work of God 
here on the earth. In hearing the re- 
marks that have been made in this 
Conference of the great growth of the 
people I was reminded of being with 
President Wilford Woodruff, standing 
in a wagon, in Idaho, some fifteen 
years ago next May, and talking to a 
half a dozen, or a dozen young people 
that were located there, and I was also 
very forcibly reminded of the remarks 
of that Prophet of God made them. I 
remember that the young people were 
somewhat discouraged on Sand Creek, 
as they looked around over land, with- 
out a tree, without a shrub except sage 
brush, without so much as a log cabin. 
Brother Woodruff said to the young 
people: "Be not discouraged; be not 
disheartened, because God's blessing is 
upon this land. It will only be a little 
time until there will be prosperous and 
happy settlements of the Latter-day 
Saints here. Tou feel that you have 
gone away from your friends; that you 
are almost out of the world, but it will 
be only a short time when you will 
have a meeting house, and a school 
house and all of the facilities here that 
you had at home before you came here. 
God will bless and multiply the land." 
What is the result today? On that si ot 
of ground stands the town of Iona, the 
headquarters of one of the Stakes of 
Zion, with about five thousand people 
instead- of six or seven young people; 
the words of the Prophet Wilford 
Woodruff have been fulfilled to the v.;ry 
letter. 

The Latter-day Saints are indeed, as 
the Prophet Joseph said they should be, 
a mighty people in the midst of the 
Rocky Mountains and we are simply 
in our infancy. We are beginning to 
grow and to become a mighty people, 
but we are as nothing to what we will 
be. There is no question in my mind 



but what the Lord Is going to multiply 
the Latter-day Saints and bless them 
more abundantly in the future than He 
has ever done in the past, provided of 
course we are humble and diligent; 
provided we seek for the advancement 
of God's kingdom, and not to do our 
own mind and will. We have the Gos- 
pel of Jesus Christ restored to us; we 
have the plan of life and salvation; we 
have the ordinances of the Gospel not 
only for the living but for the dead. We 
have all that is necessary, not only for 
our own salvation, but that we may be 
in very deed "Saviors upon Mount 
Zion," and enter into the temples of 
our God and save our ancestors who 
have died without a knowledge of the 
Gospel. I was particularly struck yes- 
terday in listening to the remarks of 
President Cannon. He said, "Where is 
there a minister today that ha,s the 
hardihood to stand up and preach that 
little babes who die are sent to hell be- 
cause they were not sprinkled?" The 
Gospel of Jesus Christ, the leaven of 
the Gospel, is going through the whole 
lump. The whole world has partaken 
to a greater or less extent of the prin- 
ciples of the Gospel; and men dare not 
stand up today and advocate this doc- 
trine of devils, so to speak, because it is 
a damnable doctrine to teach tnit little 
innocent babes shall be sent to hell. 
When we contemplate the Gospel as it 
is and as it has been revealed, as re- 
corded in the seventy-sixth section of 
the Doctrine and Covenants, our hearts 
swell with joy and thanksgiving: 

"And this is the Gospel, the glad tid- 
ings of which the voice out of the heav- 
ens bore record unto us. 

"That He came into the world, even 
Jesus, to be crucified for the world, and 
to bear the sins of the world, and to 
sanctify the world, and to cleanse it 
from all unrighteousness; 

"That through Him all might be 
saved whom the Father had put into 
His power and made by Him. 

"Who glorifies the Father, and saves 
all the works of His hands, except 
those sons of perdition, who deny the 
Son after the Father has revealed Him; 

"Wherefore, he saves all except 
them." 

Certainly this is glad tidings of great 
joy, that every human being except 
those that have a knowledge of Jesus

Christ and who sin against that knowl- 
edge, shall be saved; and in this reve- 
lation the wonderful testimony has 
been borne to us by the Prophet Joseph 
Smith and Sidney Rigdon: 

"For we saw him, even on the right 
hand of God, and we heard the voice 
bearing record that he is the only be- 
gotten of the Father — 

"That by him and through him, and 
of him, the worlds are and were cre- 
ated, and the inhabitants thereof are 
begotten sons and daughters unto God." 

I bear witness to you, although I 
have not seen the Savior sitting upon 
the right hand of God, I know that He 
lives; that I know that Jesus is the 
Christ; that I know that Joseph Smith 
was a prophet of God; I know that the 
signs follow the believer; I know that 
hands are laid upon the sick and that 
the sick do recover; I know that we 
have the gift of tongues among the 
Latter-day Saints; I know that we 
have visions, dreams, and revelations; I 
know that Lorenzo Snow is a true 
prophet of God. I bear this witness to 
you and to all the world, and I pray 
God that as we grow in years that we 
may grow in the knowledge of the Gos- 
pel, and I ask it in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 

The Temple choir sang the hymn 
commencing, 

Zion stands with hills surrounded, 
Zion kept by powers divine. 

ELDER GEORGE TEASDALE. 

Value of a well spent life — The Saints patriotic 
lovers of liberty. 

In the hymn just sung a very sweet 
text is given unto me: "God is with 
thee." I think it has been demonstrat- 
ed at this Conference, in the testimo- 
nies that have been given concerning 
us and concerning the establishment of 
the Church of Christ upon the earth in 
these latter days — that God is with 
us, and that the prophecies are being 
fulfilled establishing the truth of the 
utterances of the prophets that have 
lived upon the earth in the days that 
are gone; and that the glorious princi- 
ples of the everlasting Gospel are be- 
ing preached by us in all the world 
for a witness; to the accomplishment 
of His own glorious pur-poses, as has 
* been demonstrated in the discourses 



that have been given during this Con- 
ference concerning the work of God in 
the earth, and its wonderful progress. 

I was very much impressed a few 
days ago when 1 had the honor of an 
invitation to the Temple by the Temple 
workers, who, loving their president, 
had invited him to come and spend an 
hour or two with them upon the anni- 
versary of his birthday— I was very 
much impressed with the value of a 
well-spent life. What a credit it is to 
a man and how God is glorified in hav- 
ing such sons as our president here in 
this lower world, surrounded by all its 
allurements and temptations, who 
of their own free will and agency take 
up the cross of Christ, obey His un- 
popular doctrine; and are willing to be 
looked upon as the offscouring of all 
flesh, because they love God, acknow- 
ledge the atonement of His son and 
desire to love Him and keep His com- 
mandments rather than anything else, 
no matter what the consequences may 
be! I can understand how God is glori- 
fied because it is by the grace of God 
that we are sustained. We could not do 
without it, and it is another evidence 
that God is with us. 

1 remember coming out of the world, 
and I remember accepting this unpopu- 
lar doctrine; I remember the contumely 
and scorn and contempt that I had to 
pass through; and I have advocated 
this despised doctrine and have been 
sustained by the grace of God, and I 
know that He has been with me; and 
in all my tribulations, afflic- 
tions, in my bereavements and 
heartaches, I can bear testimony 
that God has been with me. I 
know that God lives. I have learned 
that in my experience; He has been my 
counselor and my guide; He has been 
my director. I have sought the coun- 
sels of His will and have endeavored in 
my poor way to carry them out, and I 
can bear this testimony that God has 
been with me. He has sustained me in 
all the vicissitudes of life: and in the 
fulfilment of all my duties; and I also 
know that He is with this people; and 
that which we are most condemned for 
— our belief in plural marriage — is, to my 
mind, another evidence that we are the 
Israel of God. Pagan Rome prohibited 
plural marriage, and this action has 
been generally accepted and sustained

GEISERAL CONFERENCE. 



by the so-called Christian nations, of 
the earth. Now, we are told not to love 
the world nor the things of the world. 
If we love the world the love of God is 
not with us; but there are many other 
evidences that this people are the peo- 
ple of God, and that God has sustained 
them, and that He is with them. The 
Latter-day Saints are devoted to tneir 
country; they are devoted to the 
Constitution; they look upon it as a 
sacred record, given by inspiration; and 
they revere the men who were made 
instruments in the hands of Almighty 
God in framing that wonderful docu- 
ment; and they are true and faithful to 
vt; and they have manifested this faith- 
fulness on all occasions. Whenever 
their country required their as- 
sistance, they have been ready to 
lay down their lives in defense 
of it and in defense of the 
flag, and in defense of the constitu- 
tion. We are a liberty loving people, 
and we respect the government, and we 
manifest this in the course that we are 
taking today. We can afford to labor 
and wait, because we know that inteli- 
gence must rule. Mob violence and mob 
rule is distressing, but the rule and 
government of intelligence is what we 
all desire, for when the righteous rule 
the people rejoice, and when the wicked 
rule the people mourn. We are in favor 
of good government; we are in favor of 
intelligence. We give our children the 
best education that we can. Our aca- 
demies and our seminaries of learning 
show this. The first house for public 
purposes that is built in any of our set- 
tlements is, as a rule, the school house. 
We have always demonstrated that we 
were in favor of education. We want 
doctrines, but we want likewise 
good education. We don't want 
to be taught false theories and 
false doctrines, but we want 
the truth as it is in Christ 
Jesus, because to know God and Jesus 
Christ whom He hath sent is eternal 
.life; and we want this eternal life. 
That is one reason why we assemble 
in conference — to learn of the ways of 
the Lord, that we may walk in His 
paths. We want to understand th? con- 
ditions of salvation. 

I have a profound affection for the 
Apostle John. He says, in the first 
chapter of his first epistle: 



"That which was from the beginning, 
which we have heard, which we have 
seen with our eyes, which we have 
looked upon, and our hands have han- 
dled, of the Word of life; 

"(For the life was manifested, and we 
have seen it, and bear witness, and 
show unto you that eternal life which 
was with the Father, and was mani- 
fest unto us;) 

"That which we have seen and heard 
declare we unto you, that ye also may 
have fellowship with us; and truly our 
followship is with the Father and with 
His Son Jesus Christ. 

"And these things write we unto 
you that your joy may be full." — (I 
John i, 1-4.) 

He thus wrote unto the saints, 
those who had obeyed the prin- 
ciples of the Gospel — the doc- 
trine of Christ. They believed and 
worshipped the living and true God 
in the name of Jesus Christ, accepting 
the atonement; they had repented of 
their sins and of their false doctrines 
and theories; they had been baptized 
by immersion for the remission of their 
sins; they had received the efficacy of 
the precious blood of Christ which fol- 
lows the water and they had received 
the gift of the Holy Ghost. He further 
says: 

"This then is the message which we 
have heard of him, and declare unto 
you, that God is light and in Him is 
no darkness at all." 

That is what we believe. 

"If we say that we have fellowship 
with Him and walk in darkness, we 
lie, and do not the truth." 

Now mark you, 

"But if we walk in the light as he 
is in the light, we have fellowship one 
with another and the blood of Jesus 
Christ his Son cleanseth us from all 
sin." (I John i, 5-7.) 

These are the conditions: "If we walk 
in the light as he is in the light we have 
fellowship one with another and the 
blood of His Son Jesus Christ cleanseth 
us from all sin." We believe that. We 
believe that it is necessary for us to 
walk in the light; we believe that it is 
necessary for us to keep the command- 
ments of Almighty God; and we nave 
seen that God is with those that love 
Him and keep His commandments. 

The life of our beloved President, 



ELDER GEORGE TEASDALE. 



31 



Lorenzo Snow, was reviewed on the oc- 
casion I referred to; it was a grand 
record. Then I thought of President 
Wilford Woodruff; of President John 
Taylor; of President Brigham Young; 
of President Joseph Smith, these ser- 
vants of God who have stood the brunt 
and burden of the day, being right in 
the front of the battle; and also I 
thought of their counselors: Heber C. 
Kimball, Daniel H. Wells, Willard 
Richards, Jedediah M. Grant, George 
A. Smith and others who have passed 
away — m en who have made the record 
of a well-spent life; who have done the 
will of God and kept His command- 
ments. I thought what a glorious 
record this was. What have they 
demonstrated? They have demonstrat- 
ed that they loved righteousness rath- 
er than the things of the world. Here 
is what the beloved disciple says on 
this matter: 

"Love not the world, neither the 
things that are in the world. If any 
man love the world the love of the 
Father is not in him. 

"For all that is in the world, the lust 
of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, 
and pride of life, is not of the Father, 
but is of the world. 

"And the world passeth away, and the 
lust thereof, but he that doeth the will 
of God abideth forever." (I John ii, 15- 
17.) 

I say God is with us, because we do 
His will. If we do not the will of God, 
we have no promise, for the Lord has 
said: "When you do as I say, I am 
bound to fulfill, but when you do not, 
you have no promise." (Doctrine and 
Covenants). John further says: 

"Little children, it is the last time, 
and as ye have heard that antichrist 
shall come, even now are there many 
antichrists; whereby we know that it 
is the last time. 

"They went out from us, but they 
were not of us; for if they had been 
of us they would no doubt have con- 
tinued with us; but they went out that 
they might be made manifest that they 
were not all of us. 

"But ye have an unction from the 
Holy One, and ye know all things. 

"I have not written unto you because 
you know not the truth, but because 
ye know it, and that no lie is of the 
truth." (I John ii, 18-21.) 



Why do we pay our tithes and of- 
ferings? To be obedient and do the 
will of God. That was a grand sermon 
that used to be preached by Bishop 
Kdward Hunter: "Pay your tithes and 
offerings and be blessed." He that has 
lived that principle can bear testimony 
to the truth of what was referred to 
by Brother John W. Taylor: "Whoso 
will do the will of the Father shall 
know of the doctrine." Well, how do we 
know? Because we have the living 
witness. We learned in our obedience 
that baptism by immersion for the re- 
mision of sins is necessary. God never 
established anything that was non-es- 
sential. Jesus Christ told Nicodemus 
that unless he was born again he could 
not see the kingdom of God, and that 
unless he was born of the water and 
of the Spirit he could in no wise enter 
into the kingdom of God; and when He, 
Jesus went unto John to be baptized of 
him, and John forbade him, He said, 
"Suffer it to be so now for thus it be- 
cometh us to fulfill all righteousness." 
There are two principles, Christ' and 
anti-Christ. Anti-Christ is opposed to 
the doctrine of Christ. Anti-Christ says 
the ordinances are non-essential; 
Christ says these ordinances are essen- 
tial. He also says "not those that say 
Lord, Lord shall inherit the kingdom, 
but he that doeth the will of My Father 
which is in heaven." Again — "He that 
heareth these sayings cf mine and 
doeth them, I will liken to a man that 
built his house tipon a rock, and the 
winds blew and the rains descended 
and beat upon that house, but it stood, 
because it was built upon a rock," 
"but he that heareth these sayings of 
mine and doeth them not, is like the 
man that built his house upon the 
sand, etc." The difference between the 
obedient and disobedient." 

My beloved brethren and sisters, T 
bear testimony that God is with us; 
that we are the Church of Christ, 
representing the Church of the Lamb 
upon the earth; and we be- 
lieve these everlasting principles; 
we appreciate them; and by reference 
to the Scriptures we can show that it is 
no new doctrine; that as it was in the 
beginning, is now and ever will be. 
These doctrines and principles of ever- 
lasting life are eternal. 
Another impression that was made 



32 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



upon my mind when thinking of- the 
glory of a well- spent life: I thought 
that these brethren, these representa- 
tive men, were kind to themselves; I 
thought they had chosen the better 
part; they had taken up the cross of 
Christ; and they had advocated the 
principles of Almighty God and His 
righteousness down to the very last, 
enjoining upon, their children, and upon 
their children's children to be true and 
faithful to the everlasting principles of 
the Gospel, that they may inherit that 
rest that was promised unto those that 
would love God and keep His com- 
mandments. What is meant by that 
rest? It means a fulness of everything; 
to enjoy a fulness of love, a fulness of 
light, a fulness of intelligence, a fulness 
of power; to sit down with Christ upon 
His throne, as He has overcome and 
sits upon the throne of the Father — the 
promise that was given unto the Israel 
of God — the promise that was given to 
the sons of the Most High. Do we under- 
stand these principles? Do we under- 
stand the value of a well-spent life? 
Do we understand the glory of loving 
God and keeping His commandments, 
and of keeping ourselves clean and un- 
spotted from the world? This is what 
we want to understand. We want to 
magnify the Priesthood God has given 
us and the Lord has told us concerning 
the magnifying of the Priesthood, that 
we can rightly have some idea as to 
what we can attain to, because the Lord 
has been very kind unto us in giving 
unto us the principles of the everlasting 
Gospel, and has taught us the value of 
the Priesthood. He requires an intelli- 
gent obedience. 

Let me refer you to the Doctrine and 
Covenants, page 290: 

"And this greater Priesthood (the 
Melchisedek) administereth the Gospel 
and holdeth the key of the mysteries of 
the kingdom, even the key of the 
knowledge of God; 

"Therefore, in the ordinances there- 
of, the power of godliness is manifest; 

"And without the ordinances thereof, 
and the authority of the Priest- 
hood, the power of godliness is not 
manifest to man in the flesh; 

"For without this no man can see 
the face of God, even the Father, and 
live. 

"Now this Moses plainly taught to the 



children of Israel in the wilderness, and 
sought diligently to sanctify his people 
that they might behold the face ot 
God. 

"But they hardened their hearts and 
could not endure his presence, there- 
fore, the Lord in his wrath (for his an- 
ger was kindled against them) swore 
that they should not enter into his rest 
while in the wilderness, which rest is 
the fulness of his glory." (Sec. 86, v. 
19-24.) 

Again, "For whoso is faithful to the 
obtaining of these two Priesthoods of 
which I have spoken, (the Aaronic and 
Melchisedec) and the magnifying their 
calling, are sanctified by the Spirit unto 
the renewing of their bodies; 

"They become the sons of Moses and 
of Aaron, and the seed of Abraham, 
and the church and kingdom, and the 
elect of God; 

"And also they who receive this 
priesthood receiveth me, saith the Lord; 

"For he that receiveth my servants 
receiveth me; 

"And he that receiveth me receiveth 
my Father; 

"And he that receiveth my Father 
receiveth my Father's kingdom; there- 
fore all that my Father hath shall ba 
given unto him; 

"And this is according to the oath and 
covenant which belongeth to the Priest- 
hood. 

"Therefore, all those who receive the 
priesthood receive this oath and cove- 
nant of my Father, which he can not 
break, neither can it be moved; 

"But whoso breaketh this covenant 
after he hath received it, and altogether 
turneth therefrom, shall not have for- 
giveness of sins in this world nor in 
the world to come." (Doc. and Cov. 
Sec. 86, v. 33-41.) 

I want to bear my testimony that 
this Priesthood of the Son of God has 
been restored to the earth; and that 
the Church of Christ is organized upon 
the earth, and has never required any 
re-organization — that is simply non- 
sense. It has always been intact.. God 
has been with us from the beginning; 
from the day when He took the boy 
Joseph Smith up to the present time, 
and it is by the grace of God that we 
are sustained. It is by the grace of 
God that we grow and increase as 
we are growing and increasing, be-

cause God has determined to establish 
His righteousness upon the earth and 
He will do it. He is educating- us. 

Now let me exhort you my beloved 
brethren and sisters to serve God and 
keep His commandments, for this is the 
whole duty of man. We can not make 
any excuse for rejecting the ordinances 
of the house of God, and we can not 
make any excuse for rejecting the love 
of God. We represent Christ by accept- 
ing His doctrine. When we are in favor 
of the doctrine of Christ we manifest 
our faith by our works, and conse- 
quently are saved by grace and are 
justified by faith, because we manifest 
our faith by our works. There is the 
key. It is all nonsense that 
ordinances are non-essential. They 
are essential and have to be ad- 
ministered by the proper authority in 
order that we may obtain redemption 
from death and from hell and from the 
grave, and in order that we may not 
die in our sins, for if we do reject the 
ordinances of the house of God we will 
die in our sins. If we want to be re- 
deemed, we have to accept and obey the 
message of Almighty God. We have 
done so, and it has brought us out of 
the darkness which covers the earth. The 
Gospel message is extending upon our 
right hand and upon our left, and God 
is gathering His people, His Israel, as 
He predicted He would do. 

I pray God our eternal Father that 
we may have grace to overcome temp- 
tation, obey His commandments and in 
the end be saved in His kingdom 
through Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang: 

God moves in a mysterious way 
His wonders to perform. 

Benediction by Elder B. H. Roberts. 



AFTERNOON SESSION. 
2 p. m. 

The choir and congregation sang the 
hymn commencing: 

How firm a foundation, ye Saints of 
the Lord, 

Is laid for your faith in His excellent 
word. 

What more can He say than to you He 
hath said, 

You who unto Jesus for refuge have 
fled. 



Prayer by Elder Angus M. Cannon. 
The hymn which begins, 

For the strength of the hills we bless 
Thee, 

Our God, our Father's God, 
was sung by the choir. 

ELDER JOHN HENRY SMITH. 

The Saints successful colonizers— Should seek to 
obtain the most perfect products from the soil — 
Suitable literature should be utilized. 

I am happy in the opportunity of 
meeting with you again in general con- 
ference. I have had great pleasure in 
listening to the remarks that have been 
made by the brethren who have spoken 
to us thus far in the conference; and if 
I can have your faith and prayers and 
the Spirit that has actuated their ut- 
terances, I desire to speak upon several 
topics, in brief, that are in my judg- 
ment of material interest to the Lat- 
ter-day Saints. 

We have not obtained our present po- 
sition in the world altogether upon the 
ground of the spiritual Instruction 
embraced in the Gospel. The practical 
application of the faith we have es- 
poused has probably brought us a very 
fair share of the respect and esteem in 
which we are held by many thinking 
people of the world who have seen the 
results that have come from the de- 
gree of unity we have exhibited in the 
practical concerns of life. Our reputa- 
tion in connection with the deveopment 
of the land that we have occupied has 
gone out to the world; and wherever 
men may be found who are desirous of 
establishing colonies and seeking to de- 
velop the sections of country which 
they occupy, they are anxious to secure 
men who are conversant with the meth- 
ods that have been adopted in the de- 
velopment of those sections of country 
that the Latter-day Saints occupy to- 
day. We have been the pioneers in the 
establishment of the village system. 
We have been pioneers in the distribut- 
ing of water in the forms largely util- 
ized at the present time in this western 
country. While the Indians and the- 
Catholic fathers who preceded us in 
various sections of this western land 
had achieved some success in utilizing 
the water by irrigation, it remained for 
the Utah pioneers, and they that fol- 
lowed them in the planting of the 
standard in this part of the world, to.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



establish and apply properly and suc- 
cessfully the water, that has made the 
land productive and brought such won- 
derful results. This has brought to us 
the notice of the world. "While many 
practical men turn away from most of 
the doctrinal views we present, the re- 
sults which have been manifest in the 
union of action exhibited in the devel- 
opment of the resources of our section 
of the country have caused them to 
stop and examine, and they have been 
led to look for the causes which have 
produced these results. I presume, if 
an examination were made today 
among men who have been in some 
measure conversant with the efforts 
made and the results that have come 
therefrom, it would be found that many 
men have been led to an examination 
and final acceptance of our faith from 
its practical results as developed in the 
comforts and blessings attendant upon 
the great mass of the people. The 
changing of men from the workshop 
and the smithy in foreign lands or in 
different parts of our own land, to the 
conditions that arise from the posses- 
sion of the soil, the owning of a house 
and of the implements of husbandry, 
and utilizing the industry and talents 
possessed by them, has brought to the 
people a degree of independence that is 
not so fully marked among any other 
people with whom I have been con- 
versant. 

I am extremely anxious in this con- 
nection that there shall be no slacken- 
ing in this material development — in 
the extension of our farms, our gar- 
dens, and our orchards, and in the abil- 
ity to utilize the products of those 
farms, gardens and orchards in the in- 
terest of ourselves, by being able to 
place them upon the markets of the 
world in such form as will bring to us 
the best prices and maintain our repu- 
tation for judgment, prudence and in- 
dustry. I am fearful that a tendency 
in the direction of slackening in that 
pride that should characterize every 
man and woman who has become con- 
versant with the spirit of the Gospel is 
showing itself, in some instances, in de- 
grees of laxity. The orchards are not 
receiving that attention, the gardens 
that care, and the farms that manifest 
industry that characterized our earlier 
efforts, when but limited areas of 
ground were being utilized and the cul- 



tivation was intense in order that it 
might produce the best possible results 
and meet the necessities of those who 
occupied the same. In order that we 
may continue in our growth and de- 
velopment, and be enabled to have 
means necessary for the adornment and 
beautifying of our homes and the en- 
largement of the spheres in which we 
are acting, I trust that there shall be 
no slackening in connection with these 
matters. Our farmers in the various 
sections of the country should employ 
their talents in the direction of form- 
ing an organization suitable to them- 
selves, looking to the proper arrange- 
ment of the character of the products 
that shall be planted, and strive in 
every way to improve these products 
and put them upon the market in such 
a condition that wherever ,they are 
there will be a demand for them that 
those who go to the markets will ask 
for Utah peaches, Utah apples, Utah 
vegetables, and buy them in prefer- 
ence to all others, because they are put 
up in the proper form and are the best 
on the market. It seems to me that in 
this matter a people organized as we 
are, with our ability to reach every 
home, could so act in unison with each 
other upon these questions that thous- 
ands of dollars that now annually go to 
waste within our border, because the 
fruit and the vegetables are not proper- 
ly cared for, might be utilized in bring- 
ing to the homes of the people the nec- 
essary comforts and adornment and 
providing that practical and proper 
education which shall make us not 
alone the required help of our neighbors 
and friends who want men possessing 
the talent to develop their farms, es- 
tablish their villages and increase the 
interests of the people, but which shall 
also make us better in these respects 
in the future than in the past. 

I ask you, my brothers and my sisters, 
to look wisely and prudently into these 
propositions. There must be an exten- 
sion of opportunities presented to the 
young men and maidens of our State 
in the direction of the establishment of 
homes. We are extending our borders 
in some degree. A few are planting 
themselves in Mexico a few in Canada, 
a few northward in Idaho, some in 
Montana, in New Mexico, in Arizona 
and in Colorado, and are working out 
these problems looking to the material

uplifting and independence of the" peo- 
ple of God. While this is being done, we 
desire that each step in the direction of 
our development shall exhibit the fact 
that we have a purpose and object in 
view — not alone the spiritual teaching 
of the people, but their physical, men- 
tal and moral development and their 
financial worth. And if we can estab- 
lish within them a determination to do 
and to be something in the line of their 
moral and financial development, they 
will begin to drink in of the spirit of 
that work that led the founders of 
this organization to move westward 
in the hope of bringing out 
the powers, developing the resources 
and preparing and qualifying the men 
who are to become conversant with this 
work for the great mission of the re- 
generation of the world. It leads us to 
the conquering of the elements around 
us, that we may conquer the world; not 
upon the basis of the exercise of mili- 
tary dominion, but upon the basis of 
a developed faith and an understand- 
ing of the material nature of the work 
of God. The Lord has planted within 
our bodies a spirit that is in touch 
with His Spirit, and He purposes to 
bring out every power of mind and 
body, and to implant in the soul the 
highest possible understanding of the 
requirements and obligations that can 
attach to a mortal. 

Therefore, my brothers and sisters, in 
the development of this work that our 
Father has set us to do, no greater 
part can be given to men than provid- 
ing for the needs of their fellows, open- 
ing doorways to their growth, putting 
them in a condition of independence 
upon a farm, and bringing out the pow- 
er to cultivate and manage for them- 
selves, that they in turn may employ 
their talents in the interest of others 
who perchance may not be so fully de- 
veloped and equipped for the duties and 
responsibilities of life. Let us show to 
the world that, having laid the founda- 
tion of the system of development in 
this region of the country, where irri- 
gation is a necessity, we can utilize it 
to the uttermost for our own wellbeing 
and for the wellbeing of our fellow men. 
In the extension of our settlements, in 
their growth and expansion, let us 
exhibit that care, that wisdom, that in- 



telligence and that industry that shall 
entitle us to such expressions as I have 
heard on railroad trains from gentle- 
men who have said, "I see that we are 
approaching a 'Mormon' settlement. 
There is an evidence of joint action and 
union. The canals are larger; while the 
farms are small they are widely uti- 
lized." I trust that inasmuch as we 
are compelled in the older sections of 
our country to have small farms, there 
will be a union of action in the plant- 
ing of vegetables and grains, fruits and 
flowers, so that whatever we may have 
to put upon the market there will be in 
it the evidence of talent, of wisdom and 
of industry manifested, which will 
bring to us the best possible results. 

I have another subject in my mind 
upon which I wish to speak. At the 
present time it is claimed that we have 
in the world in the neighborhood of 1800 
missionaries. I myself believe there are 
ten millions of people who are believers 
in this work upon which we have enter- 
ed. All of them, it may be true, have 
not come within the fold; but I believe 
there are ten millions of people 
who believe in the doctrines and 
mission of Joseph Smith, and 
in that priesthood and authority 
given of God in this dispensation. While 
many of them stand aloof, in their 
hearts they are praying for its develop- 
ment and advancement and in a quiet 
way lending their influence for the fur- 
therance of the purposes of God. Be- 
lieving that this condition exists to 
quite a degree in all parts of 
the world where the Elders have 
made their way, and in some 
sections possibly where they 
have not made their way, I desire to 
bring before this congregation a 
thought in connection with the utili- 
zation of the printed word. We see our- 
selves at the present time engaged in 
producing many newspapers and mag- 
azines, whose sympathies are with the 
work, though they may be engaged in 
some specific line. As I note the estab- 
lishment of newspapers and maga- 
zines in our midst, I wonder from time 
to time how far as Saints we are using 
this agency in the interest of the devel- 
opment of God's work. How many now 
under the sound of my voice, after they 
have looked through their paper or their 



36 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



magazine, wrap it up and mail it to 
father, or mother, to brother or sister 
to old-time friend and acquaintance, in 
Scandinavia., in Germany, in Austria, 
France, in England, in Scotland, in 
Wales, or in the States of this Union? 
How many, after having seen an item 
that would impress their kindred or 
their friends in regard to the conditions 
existing here, have taken the trouble 
to further the interest of the work of 
God by sending the paper containing 
this item where it will do good? I ask 
you, my brothers and sisters, to ex- 
amine the matter in this light of wis- 
dom. Ix>ok into your own homes; 
study the character of the magazines 
that are upon your own tables, which 
your own children are a little 
loth to read perchance, and which 
you do not devote very much time to; 
note their contents, and send them in 
these different directions, as agencies, 
tending to bring before the minds of 
the people of the world the conditions 
that surround you, and that you live in 
a civilized community. There are many 
people that question there being in this 
western country a people who have the 
arts of civilization. They regard us in 
a measure as savages, and are there- 
fore inclined to close their minds 
against us and say harsh things rela- 
tive to us. 

Occasionally there are those not of 
our society who write articles in our 
defense, and who are anxious to spread 
among the people with whom they 
have been acquainted some understand- 
ing of the character of the people 
among whom they at present reside. 
One man who has done something in 
this respect is Mr. Charles Ellis. He 
has written pamphlets in the interest 
of our people, exhibiting their charac- 
teristics, and seeking to bring before 
the minds of people outside of our own 
circle the fact that while Mormonism 
has been an agency in the dissemina- 
tion of the Christian doctrines as Christ 
Himself presented them to the world, 
it has also been an agency for the in- 
dustrial advancement and uplifting of 
the men and women who have accepted 
of its principles and who have gathered 
within its charmed circle. "Where in 
the wide universe can there be found a 
body of ministers — as the world would 
be pleased to style us — that nave laid 



the foundation of the material well- 
being of a people as has been done by 
Brigham Young and the founders of 
this work upon this the backbone of 
the American continent? 

My brothers and my sisters, I plead 
with you to utilize the printed word as 
it comes from the pens of our brethren, 
and the printed word of strangers who 
may come in our midst and become im- 
pressed at least with our honesty and 
our devotion to God, whether they can 
accept the views we may entertain in 
regard to God and His Son Jesus Christ 
or not, so that a knowledge of the truth 
as it is may be disseminated abroad 
in this way as well as by the preach- 
ing of the word. 

I feel to bear my witness, in connec- 
tion with my brethren, to truths of that 
Gospel which we have embraced. God 
the Father came. He introduced His. 
Son, in this dispensation. There is no 
mistake in regard to this matter. Hia 
voice was heard, His person was seen. 
The keys of the priesthood of eternity 
were turned. Man was instructed to go 
forth and preach and teach, to point the 
way of temporal life as well as the way 
of spiritual life, and make the sons and 
daughters of God acquainted with the 
means and methods by which they 
could indeed be saved here as well as 
hereafter. Therefore, let us fulfil our 
mission, scatter the printed word, point 
the way and help the millions outside 
whose hearts have been touched in 
some degree by this work, and who are 
watching and waiting in anticipation 
of its development, though lacking the 
moral force to put on the armor of eter- 
nal truth and proclaim it in force and 
power unto the world. Let us awaken 
these from their lethargy, arouse them 
from their sleepiness, and plant within 
their hearts the truth that God's work 
has come, and that all should accept 
and love it because it teaches them the 
way of spiritual as well as temporal 
life. 

May God bless and prosper the good 
work; may its truth be written upon 
our hearts and souls; may we never 
fail to do our part in connection with 
its advancement, is my prayer in the- 
name of Jesus. Amen.

Comprehensiveness of the plan of Salvation— Faith 
the result of evidence— What we enjoy here a fore 
taste of that which is to come — Forgiveness asso- 
ciated with repentance— Testimony of Jesus and 
of the ancient and modern prophets. 

I trust, my brethren and sisters, that 
you will give me the same support of 
your faith and prayers that you have 
my brethren who have spoken, that the 
Spirit of the Lord may assist me as 
they have been assisted. Many thoughts 
pass before the mind when we hear our 
brethren speak upon the principles of 
life and salvation. We realize that we 
are connected with a very important 
work— as important, no doubt, as any 
work that has ever been established up- 
on this earth. The fact that it has been 
introduced by our heavenly Father and 
is His work, for the salvation of the 
children of men, certainly should be 
evidence enough to make it of suffi- 
cient importance for us to give to it our 
undivided attention. 

The authority of the Lord has been 
revealed in our day, and it is possessed 
by a host of men. "We are under obli- 
gation to bear testimony to the doc- 
trines that are revealed for the salva- 
tion of the world, that light may come 
into the hearts of the people; for this 
world lieth in darkness, in a fallen 
state. We are dependent upon the as- 
sistance of our heavenly Father for our 
redemption, and it is important that we 
should be redeemed in this life. The de- 
sign of our Father is that His children 
should be relieved from the effects of 
the fall, be redeemed from the power of 
sin and Satan, and be brought back in- 
to fellowship with Him. The plan that 
He has offered us for this purpose 
commends itself to every honest, un- 
prejudiced soul, because it is a reason- 
able plan, founded on truth. It has 
saved people before, it is saving people 
now, and will save people so long as 
there are people to be saved, and there 
always will be people to be saved. 
When we think of this work as it has 
been spoken of in this conference, and 
what it has accomplished in sixty-nine 
years, we cannot help but be impressed 
with it. Though there be many people 
who have never heard of us, yet this 
work has stirred the world. There is 
not a nation perhaps but what has been 
more or less agitated in regard to this 



people and our doctrines; and there are 
many people, as suggested by Elder 
John Henry Smith, that believe the 
doctrine but have not the courage to 
embrace it, because it is so unpopular 
and so trying to men's souls. 

The Gospel is suited to all the condi- 
tions of mankind. It will meet every 
requirement of man, and it will satisfy 
every rational ambition and every 
righteous desire of the human heart. It 
is perfect in every respect. It is broad 
enough and deep enough for the rich 
and for the poor, for the intelligent and 
for the ignorant. It will bring to 
every person exactly what is necessary 
for his salvation. If men need to be 
humbled, it will school them. If they 
need to be exalted, it will lift them up. 
If they have need to be reformed, it will 
reform them. In fact, as I have said, 
it will meet all the requirements of 
human nature. 

The first principle of the Gospel is 
faith in God. How could we have such 
faith as is established among this peo- 
ple, if it were not for evidence? Men 
may believe the doctrines that are 
taught them, but it takes reliable evi- 
dence to establish faith in the hearts 
of the children of men; for we are rea- 
sonable beings, the offspring of reason- 
able parents, and we need to be con- 
vinced that the doctrines are what they 
profess to be. We need not only to be- 
lieve in God, but we need to have faith 
in Him. When faith springs up in the 
heart, its germs are living germs, and it 
develops and increases as the soul re- 
mains in proper condition for its growth 
and development; and as it increases in 
our hearts, so we labor, so we are hum- 
ble, so we are faithful and devoted 
to the Lord. We desire to become more 
acquainted with God, and with the 
principles that have made Him and His 
Son so great, and that have made so 
many of His posterity great men and 
women. We desire to go back into His 
presence. The Gospel is taught for this 
purpose, and it is having its influence 
over us. We are listening to the coun- 
sels of the Holy Spirit. True, we have 
at our head a prophet, seer and revela- 
tor. We have quite a number of them. 
Then in every home, in every ward, in 
every stake, in every quorum, in every 
mission, and in every department of 
this work there are men with the in-

spiration of the Holy G-host, the testi- 
mony of the Lord Jesus; and that testi- 
mony directs these men acording to the 
degree in which they are devoted to 
the service of God and lose their own 
selfishness. So that there is a stream 
of revelation and inspiration coming to 
the Church, not only through the 
prophet, seer and revelator who stands 
at our head and gives the word of the 
Lord for the whole Church, but it comes 
to every man and woman. It has borne 
record to your hearts during this con- 
ference, as it has done in all 
conferences when we have come 
together with a desire to know the will 
of God. The testimony of the Holy 
Ghost in our hearts has brought con- 
viction and satisfaction to our souls, 
and we have had a taste of inspiration 
and a measure of understanding in re- 
gard to the Gospel of life and salvation. 
We have been saved a little; and as we 
have learned and enjoyed a little in this 
life, so shall we in the world to come 
enjoy much. As in this life we have 
been faithful over a few things, in the 
world to come we shall be made rulers 
over many things. As we have a fore- 
taste of heaven in this life, we shall 
have a fulness of joy and happiness in 
the world to come. And it may be in- 
creased very materially in this life. We 
have no need to be satisfied with the 
little we have already received; for the 
windows of heaven are open, and in- 
spiration comes to us just as freely and 
as liberally as our hearts are open to 
receive it. Heaven may be upon this 
earth, and no doubt it will be. We are 
having a little foretaste of these things 
now. We know what is good, what is 
sweet, what is delicious, what is pre- 
cious, and what is valuable to us in this 
life, and what is suited to our needs 
and desires; and we shall want a ful- 
ness of these things hereafter. But if 
we are wise we shall come as near to 
obtaining a fulness in this life as we 
can. We will seek the riches of eternity 
here. We can take the riches of eternal 
life with us when we leave this sphere, 
but we cannot take the riches of this 
world. Yet the riches"of this world are 
convenient and necessary, and we can- 
not very well get along without them. 
But the riches of eternal life are last- 
ing and permanent. They come from 
the good we accomplish, the righteous- 
ness we bring to pass, the purity to 



which we attain, the cleansing and puri- 
fying of our own hearts, that we may 
come as near being perfect in this life 
as our Father and His Son Jesus Christ 
are perfect. Why shall we not do right? 
What commandments of the Lord are 
there that we cannot observe? What re- 
quirements are there in this Church 
that we cannot comply with? The 
Lord wants us to have faith in Him. 
Now, that is possible. He has the 
faith to bestow. He is the giver of it. 
Man cannot impart it. It is the gift 
of God — a gift that He is anxious to 
bestow upon all His children. 

Repentance is also a gift from the 
Lord, as precious as faith. We cannot 
be saved by faith alone. We must re- 
pent. Repentance is necessary to sal- 
vation. Elder M. W. Merrill suggested 
that the first step to get out of debt was 
to quit going in debt; so I say that the 
very first step to repentance is to quit 
sinning and to become manly, honor- 
able and upright. There is no forgive- 
ness of sin without repentance. For- 
giveness does not come by faith alone, 
nor by promising that we will do better 
some time. It is necessary that we 
should cease sinning and begin to do 
well. Where we were liars, we must 
tell the truth; where we were unright- 
eous and impure, we must be pure and 
upright. Then we can obtain the bless- 
ing of forgiveness. Is there a man in 
the world that can say that that is un- 
reasonable? Is it reasonable that men 
should be forgiven of their sins if they 
do not cease sinning? Certainly not. 
Men must cease to sin, and turn to the 
Lord; for there is no one else can for- 
give. We are not able to forgive each 
other's sins. We cannot atone for our 
own sins. That is why it was necessar> 
that the Son of God should come from 
heaven, where He had such joy and 
glory with the Father, into this world 
and offer an atonement for mankind. 
He offered His life and suffered as a 
God only could suffer, in order that 
men might be relieved of their sins. 
Man could not do that; it was the work 
of a God. And it is the work of God 
to give you and me faith and repent- 
ance. These are principles that come 
from the upper world, not from be- 
neath. We must therefore look above 
for them, and the Lord will give them 
to us, but on proper principles. Now, 
if we can have faith in the Lord, if we

can repent and have our sins blotted 
out, is it not profitable to us to sacri- 
fice our tastes, our appetites, our car- 
nal desires, and those principles that 
only yield a temporary satisfaction, 
that we may obtain these precious 
blessings? Men are not curtailed in 
their joy and happiness, but are rather 
increased therein, by the service of the 
Lord. We ought not, however, to be 
niggardly, but we should be generous 
and great-hearted in regard to these 
matters, and seek to vie with each other 
in seeing which can accomplish the 
most for the salvation of the children 
of men. We should see which can be the 
most humble, the most faithful and de- 
voted to the Lord, in order that we may 
stand in the fellowship and favor of 
God. For there is no real joy and hap- 
piness, no salvation, except that which 
comes from the Father, in answer to 
the atonement of His Son and the shed- 
ding of His precious blood. 

How grateful and thankful we ought 
to be for this, and that this work, re- 
vealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith, has 
brought that knowledge to the world! I 
would testify of this with my brethren. 
The Presidency are all here, the Ados- 
tles are all here, the presiding quorum 
of Seventies are all here, the presiding 
Bishopric are here, the presiding 
patriarch is here. I do not 
know when we have had so com- 
plete and perfect a representation 
of the power and authority of God at 
our conference. And the people are well 
represented from all over the country. 
Now, these men are true men, whose 
hearts and souls are in the work of the 
Lord, and have been for many years. 
President Snow, President Richards, 
President Cannon and President Smith 
are men who were intimately acquaint- 
ed with the Prophet Joseph Smith, 
and with Hyrum Smith, and with tht. 
early Apostles and Elders of the 
Church. They knew their private lives 
and their public labors, and that God 
was with them. Many of us have not 
known them so intimately, not being old 
enough; but the Lord has revealed to 
us that Joseph Smith was a prophet of 
God, and we know it just as President 
Snow or these other brethren who have 
had the privilege of shaking hands with 
the Prophet. Jesus was known only 
by those who received that knowledge 
from the Father. Thousands and tens 



of thousands of men saw the Prophet 
Joseph who never once intimated that 
they thought or believed that he was a 
prophet of God. Thousands knew the 
Son of God personally, but they never 
believed He was the Son of God, be 
cause the Father did not bear record to 
them. But to us He has borne record 
that Joseph was a prophet of the living 
God. He has borne record to us that 
Jesus is His Only Begotten Son in the. 
flesh, the Redeemer of the world. He 
committed this testimony and knowl- 
edge to this people. He has 
given us a knowledge also concern- 
ing President Brigham Young, that 
great and grand man who led Israel 
in those dark and dismal days after the 
death of the Prophet Joseph, out of 
bondage unto this land of liberty, and 
established us here. What wonders 
he did for us! He was a man among 
men — the very proper man to follow in 
the footsteps of the Prophet Joseph. We 
do not know him as we will yet know 
him. Then President John Taylor, the 
personification of devotion, manliness 
and courage! No more honorable and 
upright man than John Taylor even 
lived. And President Wilford Wood- 
ruff, the very personification of humil- 
ity and meekness, of conscientiousness 
and honesty, — a man of God! And 
President Lorenzo Snow, the equal of 
any of them! Are we worthy, my breth- 
ren and sisters, to be associated with 
and led by such men? If so, then let 
us listen to their counsel, and uphold 
their hands. God will vindicate His 
cause in the earth. It is spreading to- 
day unobserved. The kingdom grows, 
and prosperity waits upon us as a peo- 
ple and as individuals. Let us be con- 
scientious, honest and upright, and be 
indeed Latter-day Saints, teaching the 
Gospel by example. We have not long 
to live, and there is no investment like 
serving God, for it is all profit. Let me 
beg of you, Presidents, High Councilors, 
Bishops, and men who bear the priest- 
hood, and all saints who have named 
the name of Jesus, let us walk in the 
footsteps of the Lord, and honor Him 
the remainder of our days, and thus be 
redeemed from the power of Satan, that 
old monster; for we are in his domin- 
ion and under his power more or less, 
and can only be redeemed by the ser- 
vice of the Lord. 
God bless you, my brethren and sis-

ters; bless Zion and all her interests; 
bless our nation— the nation that has 
given an asylum to this work and the 
people of God. The Lord raised it up, 
and He is directing and controlling it. 
If the people of the nation have of- 
fended in the past, they will make sat- 
isfaction; and the Lord is using and 
directing them, as He will direct us, for 
the accomplishment of His purposes. 
Amen. 

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 
Witnesses of the truth — Those whose hearts are not 
hardened receive it — Some Relieve but do not 
openly acknowledge — Enemies of Zion aid her 
cause — An excellent industrial iustitution. 
My brethren and sisters, so far 
throughout this conference I have been 
delighted and edified with the most ex- 
cellent spirit that has prevailed. I en- 
dorse heartily all that has been said, 
and I exhort you to a diligent and 
faithful consideration of the counsels 
and instructions we have received. 

The testimonies which have been 
borne by the Apostles in relation to the 
divine mission of the Prophet Joseph 
Smith and of the direction by God of 
all his successors down to the present, 
are true witnesses and verifications of 
God's great truth restored to the earth 
in these last days, which all mankind 
must sooner or later give ear to. These 
testimonies will stand as a witness be- 
fore all these people assembled here, 
and they will extend out unto all the 
world; for all men unto whom these 
testimonies come must receive or re- 
ject them, and God will not hold them 
irresponsible for neglect or indifference 
in relation thereto. 

I was struck by a remark made by 
one of the brethren with respect to 
the many people who saw and heard the 
Prophet Joseph Smith and yet didn't 
believe that he was a prophet of God, 
or a man raised up by the Almighty 
to lay the foundations of this great 
latter-day work. It was said that the 
Lord had not revealed it unto them. 
Now, I do not dispute that statement, 
or call it in question; but it occurred 
to me that there are thousands of men 
who have heard the voices of the in- 
spired servants of God, unto whom the 
Almighty has borne record of the truth, 
and yet they have not believed it. It is 
my opinion that the Lord bears record 
to the testimonies of His servants unto 



those who hear those testimonies, and it 
is left with them whether or not they 
will harden their hearts against the 
truth and not listen to it, and abide 
the consequences. I believe the Spirit 
of the Almighty God is upon most of 
the Elders who go out into the world to 
proclaim the Gospel. I believe their 
words are accompanied by the testi- 
mony of the Spirit of God. But all 
men are not open to receive the wit- 
ness and the testimony of the Spirit. 
And the responsibility will rest with 
them. Yet it may be possible the Lord 
withholds His Spirit from some, for a 
wise purpose in Him, that their eyes 
are not opened to see and their minds 
not quickened to comprehend the word 
of truth. As a rule, however, it is my 
opinion that all men who are seeking 
after the truth and are willing to re- 
ceive it, will also receive the witness or 
the Spirit which accompanies the words 
and testimonies of the servants of the 
Lord; while those whose hearts are 
hardened against the truth and will not 
receive it when it is borne record of 
to them, will remain ignorant and with- 
out a comprehension of the Gospel. I 
believe there are tens of thousands of 
people who have heard the truth and 
have been pricked in their hearts, but 
they are seeking every refuge they pos- 
sibly can to hide themselves from their 
convictions of the truth. It is among 
this class that you will find the enemies 
to the cause of Zion. They are oppos- 
ing the truth in order to hide them- 
selves from it. There are men possibly 
within the sound of my voice — certainly 
within the limits of this city — who have 
read our books, who have listened to 
the discourses of the Elders, and who 
are familiar with the doctrines of the 
Church; but they will not acknowledge 
— openly, at least — the truth of this 
Gospel and the divinity of this work. 
Well, the responsibility rests with 
them. God will judge them and deal 
with them in His own way and time. 
Many of them through their efforts to 
bring reproach upon the cause of Zion, 
are awakening the attention of people 
in the world to "Mormonism," and thus 
unwittingly advancing the cause of 
Zion, though they know it not. I thank 
God my Father that He brings good 
out of the evil designed against His 
people by their enemies. And He will

continue to do this. The clouds may 
gather over our heads, and, as in the 
past, it may seem impossible for us to 
penetrate them; yet there can be no 
-clouds so dark, so gloomy or so heavy, 
but God will roll them away in His 
■own time and will bring good out of 
threatening evil. He has done it in 
the past, He will do it in the future; for 
it is His work, not the work of man. 

Reference was made here by one of 
the brethren to what is being said and 
done with a view to bringing reproach 
upon the Church, because one of its 
members has aspired to political hon- 
ors, and has reached the goal of his 
aspiration by the votes of the people. 
They are seeking to make the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 
responsible for the election of one of 
its members to an office in the House of 
Representatives of the United States 
Congress. Let me say to this congre- 
gation — which will be borne out by all 
my brethren and by the truth — that 
Brother B. H. Roberts was not (and 
never was) the candidate of the Church 
•of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 
for Representative to Congress. The 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints nor any of its au- 
thorities as such ever had one 
thing to do with his nomina- 
tion or election, there are members of 
the Church who belong to his political 
party and they voted for him, and by 
their votes as well as by the votes of 
the unbelievers he was elected. And 
now these miserable scoundrels that 
seek to blacken the character of the 
Church and try to bring trouble upon 
it, are endeavoring to make it appear 
that the Church is in politics, and Bro- 
ther Roberts' election is due to "Church 
influence." This is not true. Brother 
Roberts was the candidate of his own 
party; and was elected by his party; 
the Church had no more to do with it 
than it had to do with the election of 
some Senator or Representative in New 
York, only so far, as I said before, as 
members of his political party voted for 
him. I felt that I wanted to say this 
much to the congregation; and I know 
the facts bear me out in this statement. 
The Church of Christ is not responsible 
for the actions of either of the political 
parties, in any sense, or form. If it 
were, they would stop their quarreling 



and contending, and the bitterness and 
animosity they exhibit towards one an- 
other would cease. If we had anything 
to do with them, we would stop their 
wrangling, and we would have peace in 
their ranks. The fact that they quar- 
rel as they do is proof positive we have 
nothing to do with them. 

We have had some excellent remarks 
here in relation to our home industries 
and to the labors that are being per- 
formed by Z. C. M. I., our great co- 
operative institution which was estab- 
lished by the Latter-day Saints, and is 
conducted upon the soundest business 
principles, and is today one of the most 
substantial and influential institutions 
in this western country. It is giving 
employment to many people, and pro- 
ducing shoes and wearing apparel, 
thereby saving capital at home. It is 
an institution of the people. It was 
established for the benefit of the peo- 
ple of Utah. It should be sustained by 
the people. They should see that by 
their patronage it is made strong so 
that it may never waver during the 
hard times and the financial wreck and 
ruin that may come from time to time. 
If the people will do their duty, there 
will be one institution belonging to 
them which will always be upon a firm 
foundation. And we ought to increase 
our industries, to give employment to 
our people. In relation to providing 
labor for those who come here from 
foreign lands through obedience to the 
Gospel, I fear we are not as careful of 
their welfare now as we were in year* 
past. Formerly they were assigned to 
the various wards as they came in, with 
recommendations to the Bishops and 
leading men to look after them, to pro- 
vide them labor, and assist them in 
their inexperience, that they might ob- 
tain whatever was needful for their 
good, and eventually establish them- 
selves in independency and prosperity 
by the results of their own labor. This 
is a very important question. It is al- 
so important to provide labor for those 
who have been accustomed to dwelling 
in large cities, who, when they come 
here, feel unable to make a living any- 
where else but in the city. We have 
many of such in Salt Lake City, and 
it would be well for some of them at 
least to go into the new settlements, 
take up land; change their mode of liv- 



42 



GENERAL CO A EE R ENCE. 



ing to some extent, and grow up with 
the community in which they make 
their home, and not settle down and 
depend upon the precarious chances of 
obtaining' employment in the city, 
where so many are seeking for em- 
ployment. 

May the Lord bless Israel; may He 
prosper Zion and all her people; may 
the way be opened before the poor and 
the needy, that they may, by their own 
industry and perseverance, obtain all 
that is needful for their good. One 
reason that we are brought so promi- 
nently before the world is because we 
have adhered, in some measure, to the 
instructions given in the revelations of 
God through the Prophet Joseph Smith 
in regard to industry. There should 
be no idlers in Zion. Even the poor 
who have to be assisted should be will- 
ing to do all in their power to earn 
their own living. Not one man or wo- 



man should be content to sit down and 
be fed, clothed or housed without any 
exertion on his or her part to com- 
pensate for these privileges. All men 
and women should feel a degree of in- 
dependence of character that would 
stimulate them to do something for a 
living, and not be idle; for it is written 
that the idler shall not eat the bread of 
the laborer in Zion, and he shall not 
have place among us. Therefore, it is 
necessary that we should be industri- 
ous, that we should intelligently apply 
our labor to something that is produc- 
tive and conducive to the welfare of the 
human family. God help us to do this, 
is my prayer. Amen. 

The choir and congregation sang, 
We thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet. 

Benediction by Elder George Rey- 
nolds. 

Conference adjourned till 10 a. m. on

THIRD DAY. 



MORNING SESSION. 

Sunday, April 9th, 10 a. m. 

The choir and congregation sang, 

Do what is right, let the consequence 
follow; 

Battle for freedom in spirit and 
might, 

And with stout hearts, look ye forth till 
tomorrow; 
God will protect you, do what is 
right. 

Opening prayer by Elder Rulon S. 
Wells. 

Singing by the choir: 

Softly beams the sacred dawning 
Of the great Millennial morn, 

And to Saints gives welcome warning 
That the day is hasting on. 

PRESIDENT FRANKLIN D. RICH- 
ARDS. 

Importance of instruction received— Our Savior's 
Mission — The life and immortality of men — 
Advice to young men — New and increasing 
duties during life — Reference to Tithing — 
Exhortation to faithfulness, -with blessing. 

Beloved hearers, I arise with a deep 
sense of the impossibility of any man 
edifying and instructing such a congre- 
gation as this, except he be influenced 
by the spirit of truth. Certainly, unless 
he be inspired therewith, he will be un- 
able to feed and nourish the spirits of 
his hearers, and to refresh and streng- 



then them in the way of righteousness. 
Therefore, I earnestly desire that as- 
sistence without which it is impossible 
to accomplish what is most desirable 
this morning. 

When we contemplate what the Lord 
is doing in the earth, it is marvelous 
beyond human comprehension. When 
we pass in review our personal exper- 
iences, we find all along the path of 
life occasions for the utmost gratitude 
to our Heavenly Father for His kind 
and faithful care in preserving us in 
the way of life till now. When we have 
seen so many turn to the right and to 
the left and forsake the cause of God, 
because of some trivial affair perhaps, 
it is all the more wonderful and is oc- 
casion for deeper gratitude on our part 
that the good hand of the Lord has as- 
sisted, steadied and sustained us until 
the present. We have received at this 
conference such a variety of instruc- 
tions as has seemed calculated to ex- 
tend over all the periods of human ex- 
istence, even to our daily economy, the 
culture of our gardens, our farms and 
our orchards. The way of life has 
been dwelt upon; and if we have been 
careful hearers and have treasured up 
the things that have been said, certain- 
ly to the tractable they will prove very

precious, and to those who fail to be 
benefited they will meet a great and ir- 
retrievable loss. Being surrounded 
with many cares, with the inconveni- 
ences of poverty.sometimes with pinch- 
ing want, at other times with troubles 
brought upon ourselves by our indis- 
cretion, we naturally get but part of 
the benefit which we might receive if 
we could preserve always that peaceful 
serenity and that entire composure 
which belong to those who are the most 
perfectly devoted to God and His work. 

Having had some little, experience in 
the sixty years that I have been in the 
Church, and hearing the brethren talk 
as they have during this conference, it 
has seemed to pick up and bring to 
review much of what I have experi- 
enced. 

In large congregations, where the 
Gospel is preached to strangers, there 
is a great variety of dispositions pres- 
ent to listen. There are those who re- 
ceive the words of the Elder and drink 
them in, because they seem exactly to 
satisfy the soul, and the whole nature 
yields accord and acceptance to the 
things that are taught. Many of us 
can remember when we first 
heard the sound of the Gospel. It came 
to us with a most grateful and satisfy- 
ing influence, and we embraced it the 
first time we heard it. There are those 
whose hearts and consciences are right 
before the Lord, who are ready to re- 
ceive the truth, and the Holy Spirit 
can move upon such and give them tes- 
timonies there and then. Others in the 
congregation who are more of an ag- 
nostic disposition, and do not know 
whether things are true, or whether 
they want to believe them or not, are 
there for curiosity, and they cannot ac- 
cept anything unless it is thoroughly 
proved from the scriptures. Others 
again, when anything is proved by the 
scriptures, are doubtful, skeptical, and 
of an unbelieving kind — men who have 
delighted in sin, and their consciences 
have become seared as with a hot 
iron, so that they are not sensitive 
and conscious to the truth. The Spirit 
cannot work in them, and they are un- 
worthy perhaps of these testimonies. 
There may be those even who have 
bloodguiltiness upon them, listening to 
the words of the teacher. They may be 
satisfied of their truth, but by their 
own conduct they have cut themselves 



off from accepting or taking in, with 
any sense of benefit, the glorious words 
of eternal truth that are being spoken 
to them, and they pass by them like 
the wind on the prairie or the barren 
heath, "and they do not see when good 
cometh." 

The Lord has told us, in one of His 
revelations, that from the time He gave 
the Gospel to the human family, so far 
as they heard its truths and rejected 
them, they came under condemnation. 
To reject the truths of the Gospel is a 
fearful condition. We, who have been 
led to receive and obey, have the great- 
est reason in the world to be thankful 
to Him who has given us the under- 
standing that when we heard the voice 
of the Good Shepherd we received it, 
and have tried to follow it, notwith- 
standing all our staggering infirmities 
and weaknesses, follies and frailties, 
and all the allurements of the world 
that have been around us to draw us 
away. "We have reason today to be 
exceedingly thankful to the Lord that 
we are still blessed of Him and pre- 
served in His favor. 

The Lord, on one occasion, told Moses 
what His work was. Moses became 
inquisitive. That is the way we all do 
when we are brought into the confi- 
dence of those who know more than we 
do. It is natural for us to want to get 
further knowledge, if we have the spirit 
of intelligence, which is a little of the 
glory of God. We hunger and thirst 
for knowledge. The Savior said, 
"Blessed are they which do hunger and 
thirst after righteousness; for they 
shall be filled." So we may take cour- 
age if we can only keep on and endure 
to the end. When Moses first enquired 
of Him, He turned Moses off and told 
him that the great things which he saw 
were for His honor and glory. To Him 
they were all numbered, He said; but 
to man they were not numbered. Fin- 
ally, He told Moses that "His work and 
His glory was to bring to pass the im- 
mortality and eternal life of men." 

From this it would appear that before 
the earth was created and father Adam 
given possession, it was understood 
that death might be brought into the 
world through sin and transgression, 
and that there was a provision made 
for that. The trial came, the sentence 
of death was passed, and men began to 
die. Then it seemed as if the great ob- 



44 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ject for which the earth had been 
created and man placed upon it was 
frustrated. The object had been 
for men to come and obtain 
tabernacles that they might ac- 
quire the knowledge, blessing and 
power of God in the flesh, and that he 
might be able to exalt and glorify these 
tabernacles. When death came into the 
world, the body and spirit were separ- 
ated, and this great object seemed to be 
defeated . But God had provided for this 
The Lamb of God, "slain from before 
the foundation of the world," came in 
His appointed time to correct and re- 
store. How often the Savior told the 
brethren, when they were together, that 
the whole need not a physician, but they 
that are sick. The Son of Man came not 
to call the righteous, but sinners, to re- 
pentence. He came to restore that 
which was lost, He said. Now, that 
which was lost was the tabernacle that 
had been consigned to the grave, and 
He came to bring to pass the resurrec- 
tion of the body. That seemed to be 
the summing up of the saying thaf'His 
work and His glory was the immortal- 
ity and eternal life of man"— to restore 
man, after being lost, to immortality 
and eternal life. That is what we 
are after, that through keeping the 
commandments of God we may be ac- 
counted worthy to attain unto that bet- 
ter resurrection, even the first resurrec- 
tion, to immortality and eternal life, 
and an abundant entrance into the 
kingdom of God. The Apostles seemed 
to understand this. One of them says 
that life and immortality are brought 
to light through the Gospel. He seemed 
to realize that life and immortality 
were out of sight, except as revealed 
and made manifest through the Gospel. 
Thus, the great restoration, is to be 
brought about. 

Looking on down to our own time, we 
see that we live in the dispensation of 
the fulness of times, in which the Lord 
has promised to gather together in one 
all things which are in Christ, both 
which are in heaven and which are 
upon earth. This is according to scrip- 
ture, and this is what we are working 
at. As soon as the Gospel was first 
preached to the people, they felt the 
spirit of gathering. When the Presi- 
dency, from the Kirtland Temple, sent 
Elders over to the old country and in- 
structed them not to teach gathering 



particularly at present, why the peo- 
ple got to dreaming about gathering 
and about Zion. It could not be kept 
from them. The spirit of the work was 
upon them. Thus the spirit of gathering 
comes upon the Saints wherever the 
Gospel is preached to them, and there 
arises within them an inclination to 
want to leave where they have become 
strangers, to go to people whose faith 
is like their own, with whom they are 
acquainted in the Lord and have fel- 
lowship together. 

In speaking concerning the people 
at the present time, there is one im- 
portant feature among us of great con- 
cern. That is, there are so many young 
men and young women who are of mar- 
riageable age and who ought to be tak- 
ing seriously into consideration the im- 
portance of uniting themselves together 
properly, and commencing to build up 
families and to make homes for them- 
selves, thus becoming persons of value 
and worth among the Saints in the 
latter days. If I could speak into the 
ears of a host of young men, I would say 
to each one of them, Look around you, 
my young brother, find a young lady 
who is waiting for you to come and of- 
fer to take her to wife — some faithful 
girl, who is dutiful and obedient to her 
parents at home, who has been taught 
to work and to relieve her mother, and 
who feels a spirit of ambition and en- 
ergy to take hold of life. Do not wait 
till you have got enough money to make 
a home and to store it with all the com- 
forts of life. You that are studying 
upon that point, let me cite to you a 
case that occurred just over the river 
here a little while ago. A couple had 
got some land, built a house, had it 
nicely furnished, cupboards well 
stocked, a fine cow in the stable, and 
everything prepared for housekeeping. 
They went away to get married, and 
while they were away their home was 
broken into and devastated, so that 
when they got back they had no home 
to go to. 

I want to tell you, if you have no 
home, ask the Lord to bless you and 
open up your way to make one. Go out 
and get a piece of land somewhere. 
There is plenty of land to be got in dif- 
ferent places around. Young men, take 
this matter into your hearts, and con- 
sider how you will feel when you are 
70 or 80 years of age, if you are blessed

to live that long — and you would feel 
terrible if you had a witness that you 
would not. Think how you want to be 
found when you are that age. You want 
to see your children and your grand- 
children come around you, to bless and 
comfort you, to eat and drink at your 
table, and to make you feel that you 
have a generation planted in the earth. 
Now, it is going to take some years to 
do this; but if you will get a good, hon- 
est-hearted girl, unite with her and 
plight your troth at the altar of the 
Lord, in His holy house, and let Him 
seal your hearts together, and then go 
into this labor of life and make a home 
together, you will begin to be happy. 

I remember, as if it were only last 
week, when I married and hired a 
room, in which my wife and I began 
housekeeping. Our wants were but few; 
our means very limited; but we had 
enough to eat, to be comfortable and 
happy with each other. I remember 
the first time I bowed down to pray by 
that fireside that I had hired to live 
by. I tell you I felt nearer like a man 
than I had ever done before in my life. 
When I was a single man, traveling 
around as an Elder, I had either to find 
friends or to make them; for it is the 
business of the Elder to make friends 
if they do not find them ready made. I 
used to think sometimes that mavbe 
I was in somebody's way; and when I 
was ill or afflicted, certainly I was de- 
pendent upon somebody's kindness, and 
I generally found it. But I did not feel 
that strange way in my own hired house 

Now, my good young brother, to 
whom I am talking now, you want to 
become a man among men; you want 
to become an Elder among the Elders 
of Israel; you want to have a wife, and 
a home, where you can have concen- 
trated all the comforts and happiness of 
mortal life, and where you can have the 
fulfillment of the promise that where 
two or three are agreed as touching 
anything it should be granted to them. 
I remember how we used to pray that 
the Lord would grant unto us that we 
might have children who would be kind 
and dutiful and obedient, and who 
would love Him and walk in His ways. 
The Lord gave us such children, too. 
That is the way we felt when we called 
upon the Lord and asked Him for every 
blessing that we needed. So we worked 



our way along as best we could. The- 
Lord helped us and steadied us, until 
when we had to leave Nauvoo we were 
able to leave a nice, comfortable brick 
house, a garden and lot that we had 
bought and paid for, all fenced and 
cultivated. 

Then again, when the Prophet Joseph 
was killed, the question was, how shall 
we finish the temple? I recollect well 
that. Elders were sent out through 
the Churches to gather means for this 
purpose. I was sent to Michigan. The 
thing was, that temple had to be fin- 
ished or we could not go get our endow- 
ments and learn the things that had 
been kept hid from before the founda- 
tions of the world. What was to be 
done? When we got back, the Presi- 
dency called us together and told us 
the thing as it was. I recollect dis- 
tinctly that one after another came for- 
ward and offered everything he pos- 
sessed to finish that temple, and I was 
thankful that I could count one among 
that number. Of course, things are dif- 
ferent now to what they were then. 
But this is what the young man wants. 
If he has the holy faith of the Gospel, 
he has within him the elements of a 
kindred and friends, and be a 
man among men. A Saint among 
Saints. Oh! what a blessing it 
will be to you young men 
when you get to be old, to feel that 
you have a righteous race around you, 
who will try to carry out your will and 
pleasure after you are gone. You must 
consider, my boy, that your life is not 
all of today, tomorrow, this year or 
next year. You are but making a start 
here to obtain that life and immortal- 
ity which is revealed in the Gospel, and 
to stand at the head of a righteous 
race. Father Abraham lived to be a 
hundred years old before he got a boy, 
and see what the Lord has made of 
him! His name, his seed and his gen- 
erations are here, and his blood is in 
you. The promises that were made 
unto him and to his son Isaac, and then 
to Jacob, have been renewed upon your 
fathers and the faithful in these last 
days, l^ise up and take hold of them. 
They await you. 

Speaking of my own case, I recollect 
well how, as we got along there came 
a time when we needed some consecrat- 
ed oil. I took a bottle of oil to Presi- 



46 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



dent Young in Nauvoo, and asked him 
to consecrate it. He did so; and said 
he, "The next time you want a bottle 
of oii consecrated, do it yourself." This 
is the way a man develops. He comes 
to be a father, and he needs to prepare 
himself to assume the responsibilities 
of the position, that he may bless his 
little children as they come along, and 
consecrate the oil if need be. I remem- 
ber it struck me all over when the 
President told me to consecrate the oil. 
Could I do it? Would the Lord hear 
me? Well, he told me to do it, and I 
did it. So step by step we go aTong in 
the work of the Lord. 

I recollect the first time I went to 
stop with President Young. When it 
came to prayer time, he asked Brother 
Franklin to pray. I was but a boy, and 
I turned to him and said, "President 
Young, I would rather you pray; you 
can oray better than I can." "Oh! 
well," said he, "you can pray well 
enough; you try it." So I knelt down 
and prayed the best I could. Thus we 
have to prepare ourselves and be ready 
for every duty as we go along. I wish 
that some of these boys who are among 
us, scarcely knowing which way to turn 
or what to do, would just brace up and 
do what is right, let the consequence 
follow; and, as your fathers have done, 
go and try to be somebody and do 
something that shall be worthy for both 
you and your children to remember. 

All these principles are important; 
and if the young folks sensed their im- 
portance I know there would not be 
so much carelessness as there is. You 
want to go into this union that I have 
been speaking of with a determination 
of purpose to bring to yourselves the 
pleasures and exaltations of the future 
life, bring back the pleasures and bless- 
ings of the former life, enter into the 
fulness of that life which is eternal, 
and take hold on the things of God, as 
if you meant to be men and women of 
God. Remember the pathway that some 
of your fathers and mothers have had 
to travel to get where they are today. 
Think of your condition as it is today. 
The chances for you to get and make 
homes now, why there is no comparison 
to what they were when we were in 
the States' There is/ no possible chance 
for you to have to pass through the 



severe, rugged and trying scenes that 
many of your parents have had to pass 
through to git to this place and make 
Utah what it is today. Then be brave, 
and daring, and strike out in that 
which is manifestly your duty to do. 

The first thing we have any account 
of our Father commanding Adam was 
to multiply and replenish and subdue 
the earth, and take dominion. And 
that same saying is just as applicable 
now to all good Later-day Saints in 
this new part of the world as it was 
when it was first given to father Adam. 
I really do wish that it could be sensed 
and acted upon more generally. We 
should live by every word of the Lord 
end every principle of truth that is 
g'ven to us. 

I feel like saying a few words about 
tithing — that old, threadbare subject, 
that you have not heard anything new 
about for a long time. I tell you it 
looks as new to me as it ever did, be- 
cause it is the word of the Lord; and 
unless we can take it in and make it 
to operate upon us, and we operate in 
it, we shall never become the people 
that we want to be. The Lord has 
told us positively that if we do not 
keep *he law of tithing this land shall 
not be a land of Zion unto us. Is not 
that as straight and as strong as any- 
thing we get? On the other hand, He 
says that if we will do this He will 
make it to be a land of Zion unto us. 
What does it mean to be a tithepayer? 
It means that of all which the Lord 
gives to us in this life we should de- 
vote one-tenth to Him. We should re- 
cognize that it is all His till He puts 
it into our possession as stewards; and 
when He does this we should remem- 
ber that one-tenth is not ours. It says 
expressly in the scriptures that the 
tithing is the Lord's, and therefore we 
have no right to appropriate it to our 
use and say we will restore fit at the 
end of the year, or at the end of the 
job. It is the Lord's. We have only 
right to take that which He gives to 
us. We must take this course if we 
want to get the real virtue and benefit 
of a true and faithful stewardship. You 
want to so arrange it that the food you 
eat, and the clothing you wear come to 
you through that which has been 
tithed; that your body and all that is 



PRESIDENT FRANKLIN D. RICHARDS. 



47 



in it axe composed of that which is 
rightfully given you of the Lord, and 
that you have paid your tithing on — if 
it is proper to say "paid your tithing." 
If you have not trespassed and used the 
Lord's tithing, you can feel that you 
axe doing in that what the Lord permits 
and requires. 

It is just so with everything you have 
around you. Young man, when you 
get married and secure that farm that 
we have been talking about, be sure 
that everything has been tithed before 
you get it; or, when it is given you 
with the principles of increase, that you 
tithe it faithfully while you have it in 
hand, in order that you may plant 
yourselves in righteousness on this 
land, so that wherever you locate it 
shall become a Zion unto you. That is 
the way I look at the matter of tithing. 
I think if we entertain that subject cor- 
rectly, live on the nine-tenths of what 
the Lord puts in our possession, and 
give to Him that which is His (which 
is never ours), we shall institute the 
rule and law that the Lord wants us 
to do. To me it is so simple and plain 
that a farmer would not have to stop 
to quarrel with himself to know whe- 
ther he should reckon out his labor and 
reckon out this and that before he paid 
his tithing. If we as a people would 
thus deal with the Lord in that which 
is our stewardship, how often we have 
been assured by the authorities of the 
Church that that would give enough 
revenue to meet the general expenses 
of the Church, and we would not have 
to be taxing so much and so often for 
other offerings. 

For my part, this plan of salvation is, 
as the Lord has pointed out, the way 
we have to accept; for He says if any 
bring an offering except as appointed 
by the Father, it will not be accepted. 
"We have to come to the Father by 
the Lord Jesus Christ; and by His prin- 
ciples and instructions, to become like 
Him. He wants the whole human 
family to be just as dutiful and obedi- 
ent as He was. We pray, "Our Father, 
which art in heaven; hallowed be thy 
name; thy kingdom come, thy will be 
done on earth, as it is in heaven." The 
Lord says, in the Book of Doctrine and 
Covenants, that it is His good pleasure 
to give to His people the kingdom. He 
told the early Elders to be of good 



cheer; "it is your Father's good pleas- 
ure to give you the kingdom." Now 
the kingdom of God has come; that 
is to say, the government, the priest- 
hood, the ordinances and the principles 
of salvation are revealed to us to build 
up the Church of Christ, as we may 
have it to build up until ithe Savior 
shall come, or until the prophets shall 
come and reveal to us more than we 
have already attained to. 

I recollect very distinctly hearing the 
Prophet Joseph say that the kingdom 
had come, but the will was not done yet 
on the^arth as it was done in heaven; 
and in order that the sisters especially 
might understand it, he said, "You sis- 
ters can understand it by this little 
similitude. When you scald out your 
milk pans, you have the milk pan." 
"Yes." "But it is not full of milk?" 
"No, of course not." "Now, here the 
kingdom has come, but His will is not 
done on earth yet as it is done in 
heaven. The milkpan is not filled up 
yet in doing the will of God." We are 
here to learn and to toil to this end; 
not only those who are grey-haired and 
bald-headed, but the boys and girls. 
It is for all of us to do the works ot 
righteousness and faith, that the will of 
God may be done on earth as it is done 
in heaven, so mat there may not only 
be a milkpan, but a pan of milk. 1 
heard the Prophet make use of this 
figure in the grove at the top of the 
hill, just in front of where the temple 
stood, in Nauvoo. 

My brethren and sisters, we have be- 
fore us the law of the Lord. We are 
blessed today as we have not been 
blessed in a great many years. We axe 
blessed with the First Presidency fully 
organized. We are blessed with the 
quorum of the Apostles, and all twelve 
of them are with us today. It makes 
me to feel very joyful and thankful; 
for as long as I have been in the 
quorum— now over fifty years— it has 
been but a very few times that we have 
had the pleasure of coming to confer- 
ence with a full quorum of the Twelve 
present, or coming into our council and 
talking over the things of God with a 
full number. The other councils are al- 
so generally well filled. We have over 
a hundred quorums of Seventies! The 
organization is complete, and the Lord 
has designed to bless us remarkably 



48 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



with all the facilities to keep His com- 
mandments, to covenant with Him, to 
go into His holy temples and learn how 
to become saviors for our dead, and 
labor to bring to pass this restitution 
of all things which are in Christ Jesus, 
both which are in heaven and which 
are upon earth. 

I pray that the blessings of the Lord 
may be multiplied upon us all, through 
obedience and faith in the Lord Jesus 
Christ. It has to come through obedi- 
ence, that our faith shall increase. We 
must draw near to the Lord. We do not 
ask the Lord so much as He would like 
us to ask. He has said emphatically 
that to him that asketh it shall be 
given; there is none that seeketh that 
shall not find, and to him that knock- 
eth it shall be opened. Let us cleave 
unto the Lord and walk in His ways; 
strive to serve Him in all things, that 
we may be able to increase in right- 
eousness; that we and our generations 
after us may grow up in fear of the 
Lord, honor Him in the earth, and be 
counted worthy of that life and immor- 
tality which are being brought to light 
in the Gospel, and which the Savior 
has died to bring to pass unto us. 

We ought not to forget that this is 
but the beginning of a people who are 
to have such a position that by and by 
the Lord will come and dwell in their 
midst on the earth. O glorious thought*. 
We often hear it talked about swords 
being beaten into plowshares, spears in- 
to pruning hooks, the cow and the bear 
feeding together, the lion eating straw 
like the ox, etc. All these things, and a 
multitude more, have to take place, 
and the sooner or later depends upon 
our faithfulness and our diligence in 
keeping the commandments of God and 
helping to build up righteousness in the 
earth; for He will weed out and remove 
the wicked to make room for the right- 
eous as fast as there is necessity for it. 

I pray the Lord to bless you, my 
brethren and sisters, in all your varied 
interests; in your persons with health 
and faith to overcome your infirmities, 
and with ability to live and become full 
of years and ladened with experiences 
of the goodness of God. God bless you 
in all your temporal affairs; and you 
will be if you tithe them properly and 
then use what you do use to advance 
the interests of His work. We must 



never lose sight of the fact that it is 
our great business to send the Gospel to 
the people of the earth. That is why 
we are calling upon you continually for 
brethren to go in the ministry. We 
calculate to keep calling. The demand 
is increasing everywhere. Tou fathers 
and mothers, brothers and sisters, 
please hear it, and take notice, and be- 
ready for the word when it comes for 
that son, that brother, that father to 
go and thrust in his sickle and reap, 
for the harvest is great and the work 
is increasing wonderfully. 

May the Lord bless and prosper every 
interest of Zion. May He bless the- 
Presidency, to be full of wisdom, revel- 
ation and knowledge; and the Twelve 
Apostles, that we may be such men as 
we ought to be, to take the counsels 
of the Lord and dispense them to the 
people, and administer salvation every- 
where we go. I pray that the Lord 
will increase His kindness and His af- 
fection and love towards us, and in- 
crease our kindness and affection and 
love towards you. 

You that have weaknesses, and per- 
haps have sinned, do not take it into 
your heart that the Lord wants to see 
you afflicted and cut off. He will not 
that any shall perish, but that all shall 
come to repentance. Therefore, draw 
near to the Lord, You who may feel 
yourselves the farthest from Him, find 
your way back to Him, that you may 
walk in His ways, and He will work in 
you by His Spirit after a while, and 
will show unto you His good pleasure, 
and you shall know of His favor, His 
loving kindness and forgiveness of sins. 
That we may so live that He may in- 
crease His favor and loving kindness 
toward us, I humbly desire and pray, 
with all the rest of you, in the name of 
the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

ELDER BRIGHAM YOUNG. 

The leading object of tithing is to educate the 
Saints— The necessity of being guided by the 
Spirit of God. 

If you will give me your attention I 
will endeavor to speak loud enough that 
all the congregation may hear what I

have to say. I regret very much that 
all of the congregation could not hear 
the remarks of President Richards, and 
it is possible that there are many here 
that will not hear what I have to say; 
but he has touched upon many valuable 
points and advanced doctrine that is 
dear to the heart of every Latter-day 
Saint; for with all those who have Zion 
in their hearts, her interests are fore- 
most on all occasions. President Rich- 
ards touched upon the principle of tith- 
ing, and he used these words, as near as 
I remember, in reference to this prin- 
ciple: "The old theme of tithing; there 
is nothing new in relation to it partic- 
ularly, but it is one of the most import- 
ant principles revealed to the Latter- 
day Saints. If the people dwelling upon 
this land pay not their tithing, it shall 
not be a land of Zion unto them." It is 
very important, it seems to me that we 
should pay our tithing, for if this be not 
a land of Zion unto us, then the dis- 
pleasure of God will rest upon us, for 
it was so predicted. 

There are many new things connected 
with this principle that I have heard 
the brethren speak of. I remember on 
one occasion, and I have mentioned it 
from this stand at one of our confer- 
ences, that I had a revelation in rela- 
tion to this principle. The Lord revealed 
to me, that I needed not to open the 
book of Doctrine and Covenants and 
read the revelation on tithing, but to 
speak on that principle as the spirit 
should direct, and I obeyed the voice of 
the Spirit. I was told to say to that 
congregation, that I had the privilege 
of addressing, that the principle of 
tithing was given because the people 
had rejected the higher law; and this 
law of tithing was given that they 
might be in training. It was as the 
first primer in the system of education 
to the child, and when the people had 
adopted that which had been given on 
tithing, when they had absorbed it and 
become thoroughly conversant with it, 
and were acting in perfect obedience 
thereto, God would give unto them 
again the higher law ; but if a man who 
paid his tithing did it grudgingly, he 
was blinding his eyes to his own inter- 
ests; if he laid his own judgment upon 
the revelation and paid according to 
his selfish ideas, and was very strict 
with the bishop, that he would be dealt 



with in precisely the same way by the 
spirit of God. Need I say to you that 
whenever the spirit of God begins to 
hew our sides off to straighten them, 
there wont be much timber left when 
it gets through with mortal man. That 
is my opinion, at least, and God has 
given us this law to perfect us. He has 
given it to us to bear and meet those ex- 
penses mentioned by President Rich- 
ards, but He has also given it to us for 
a greater and wiser purpose than this, 
if possible. We are in training for the 
greater law; and the man who under- 
takes to interprete the law of tithing to 
suit his notions, as I find some of the 
brethren doing, they will be misled to 
that extent that they will not be pre- 
pared for the higher law when it is 
revealed. For this is a system of train- 
ing that God has instituted for the peo- 
ple. I ask this congregation, how many 
of us are acting under that law of tith- 
ing with the free and full spirit of God 
to direct us? Every man that gives the 
Lord the advantage is on the safe side. 
Not like a sister I heard express her- 
self. She had a horse to pay for tith- 
ing; she sent it to the bishop, and she 
put the price on the animal. She said: 
"This horse is worth fifty dollars, and 
I want that credit for it." The horse 
was worth twenty-five, no more; but 
she wanted a credit of fifty dollars for 
it or to have it sent back. That spirit 
operating upon the minds of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints will becloud their minds 
to the greater blessings that God has 
in store for us. 

We, today, are in training by and 
through the influences of the spirit of 
God. As our President said yesterday, 
this people are in training throughout 
the length and breadth of the land for 
the glorious work — the redemption of 
Zion; and the man or the woman who 
puts his or her price upon articles they 
have to pay in for tithing, and who are 
glad to shovel off something that they 
have no use for in the tithing depart- 
ment, God will reward them according 
to their just deserts. If my heart is 
right, every time that I pay tithing, I 
pay it with this view and this under- 
standing before God: — I am preparing 
my mind and all that is in me that 
when the higher law shall come, I may 
be prepared to receive it, and may be 
numbered among those who will return

to Jackson County and go into the 
order which God instituted to preserve 
His people. This revelation must be 
looked upon in this light: We are in a 
school of training and God designs that 
this people should be educated, that 
they may be prepared to redeem the 
earth and make it like the garden of 
Eden. This is an important part of the 
great school which the Latter-day 
Saints are in today and have been in 
ever since I can remember, and before, 
too. Think of it, Latter-day Saints, 
that when you are paying your tithing 
you are making your minds liberal, 
spreading out, broadening your ideas, 
that when the word comes, you can say, 
I am on the altar in the Church and 
kingdom of God with everything that I 
possess, with all that the Lord has 
given me," that you may inherit ever- 
lasting life in the celestial kingdom of 
our God. If we give all, we shall in- 
herit all. It is a principle which God 
has laid down, and I exhort the Latter- 
day Saints to be very careful in paying 
their tithing, because this is the step- 
ping stone to the greater law. 

The principle of revelation to me is 
the most important principle we have, 
in one respect. If men were not dual 
creatures, and could devise means as 
to how to proceed and act with cer- 
tainty, we might say revelation was 
unnecessary. But there is no act of 
man, perhaps, that is not prompted by 
the thought that enters the brain. If 
that be the case, and man is dual, how 
necessary that we should be directed 
by the spirit of God, which He sends to 
lead men in the ways of life everlast- 
ing! How necessary it is to receive it 
and to keep it that the very thoughts of 
our minds may be directed by Him 
above, who gives life eternal. The 
principle of revelation to every man 
and to every woman is the safeguard 
that will keep them from becoming en- 
tangled in the meshes of the sinful. 

A passage comes to my mind that is 
found in Sec. 84 of the Doc. and Cov. — 
A revelation given through Joseph 
Smith the prophet, at Kirtland, Geauga 
County, Ohio, the 22nd and 23rd of Sep- 
tember, 1832, — four years before I was 
born in that place: 

"And I now give unto you a com- 



mandment to beware concerning your- 
selves, to give diligent heed to the words 
of eternal life: 

"For you shall live by every word 
that proceedeth forth from the mouth 
of God. 

"For the word of the Lord is truth, 
and whatsoever is truth is light, and 
whatsoever is light is spirit, even the 
spirit of Jesus Christ; 

"And the spirit giveth light unto 
every man that cometh into the world; 
and the spirit enlighteneth every man 
through the world, that hearkeneth to 
the voice of the spirit." 

This is the spirit that Latter-day 
Saints are taught to cultivate. That 
spirit is given; it is yours; it is in 
the possession of every human being 
that comes into the world, so far as I 
know. I see no exceptions. It is the 
province, and duty of the Latter-day 
Saints to cultivate that spirit until it 
becomes as a living fire within them. 
There is no error, though it may be 
couched in the smoothest and most 
beautiful language that can ever en- 
tangle the spirits of those who walk in 
the way of life. Therein is safety. The 
brightest intellects, the strongest 
minds, the most powerful men, are 
swayed like children by the spirits of 
the air, by the spirits from beneath, if 
they are not guarded and protected 
and strengthened by the spirit of God. 
That spirit is given to them to culti- 
vate it to the extent that it is an armor 
impregnable to all of the various sects 
and parties that are trying to drag our 
people down to destruction. 

"And everyone that hearkeneth to the 
voice of the spirit cometh unto God, 
even the Father; 

"And the Father teacheth him of the 
covenant which he has renewed and 
confirmed upon you, which is confirmed 
upon you for your sakes, and not for 
your sakes only, but for the sake of the 
whole world." 

Hear it Latter-day Saints — you are 
cultivating the spirit for the whole 
world. Not for you and your posterity, 
but for all of the children of men whom 
God has placed here. You have come 
out of the world, not to bring Babylon 
with you. But people have come here 
from Babylon, and are among the Lat- 
ter-day Saints with their sins and filth, 
and we gather it up by the handfulls,

sometimes to the extinction of that 
power that God has placed in every 
man. 

"And the whole world liveth in sin, 
and groaneth under darkness and un- 
der the bondage of sin. 

Who has said it? Jesus Christ said 
it to His servant the prophet. 

"And by this ye may know they are 
under the bondage of sin because they 
come not unto me. 

"For whoso cometh not unto me is 
under the bondage of sin. 
■ "And whoso receiveth not my voice is 
not acquainted with my voice and is 
not of me; 

"And by this you may know the 
righteous from the wicked, and that the 
whole world groaneth under sin and 
darkness even now." 

My brethren and sisters, here is a 
test for you: 

By these things that I have read you 
may know the righteous from the 
wicked. Who is it that will receive that 
spirit and cultivate it? Who is it that 
listens to the voice of the men whom 
God has placed to redeem the world and 
guide in the redemption of the human 
family? Who are these men? and 
what do they say to the people? What 
have they said to the people during this 
conference? What has the President 
and his fellow-laborers said at this con- 
ference? They have delivered unto you 
the words of life and salvation, and as 
true as God lives, according to the 
spirit that is in me, we will be judged 
by the words of these men in the time 
to come. They have given unto you the 
words of everlasting life. They have 
given unto you those things that God 
has given unto them, to purify you. 

I testify to you that the Church is 
growing; that the Gospel is here and 
men respect it and women respect it. 
But how many more might re- 
spect this glad message that God 
has sent us if they would but 
seek Him and be earnest and 
faithful and prayerful and humble and 
keep the spirit of light within them! 

God bless you and peace be unto you 
in all of your homes in all of the set- 
tlements of the Latter-day Saints. 
Be faithful that we may have victory, 
and sing the song of the victorious in 
the day that is not far distant, which 
I ask in the name of Jesus. Amen

How to overcome temptation— The H Iv^Dlrita,. 
unerring guide. 3 v 

I have been very much pleased with 
what has been said this morning, and 
also during the whole of this confer 
ence. We certainly have had a very 
excellent time. 

It struck me while Brother Young 
was addressing us that there were two 
very strong temptations that trouble 
us from time to time, and which some- 
times prevent the spirit of light from 
giving us the information absolutely 
necessary for our prosperity. One is, 
what will people say if I do so and so? 
If I do these things that are now re- 
quired of me, what will be said of me? 
I think that every one, at least most 
of my brethern and sisters who are now 
before me, will understand what I 
mean, from the experiences they have 
had. Such a consideration has affected 
almost every one. I know that it was 
the case with me, when the principles 
of the Gospel were announced and 1 
took them into contemplation. It came 
to my mind; "what will people say if 
I receive these doctrines, and it is 
known that I have become what is 
called a "Mormon?" When such a 
temptation as this comes before us it 
should be laid aside, and not permitted 
to influence us. 

Another temptation is, How much 
money shall I give? That is a very 
strong temptation to most of us, I pre- 
sume. Speaking of tithing as Brother 
Brigham has, how much of this tithing 
shall I give? Cannot I reserve a por- 
tion to myself? The Lord is very rich 
and I doubt if He will be troubled at 
all if I withhold a little for myself; and 
so a little to oneself is withheld. But 
that very little that is reserved will 
trouble that man, if his conscience is 
like the consciences of most of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints. It will trouble him more 
or less in the day time, and also when 
he thinks of it at night. He does not 
have that happiness that it is his priv- 
ilege to enjoy— it goes from him. One 
of the best things to do under such a 
temptation as that is to give, so as to 
be sure, a trifle more than is required; 
and to think that you have it wholly 
within yourself to do so. If you do this 
the temptation is overcome, you have 



52 



GEbERAL CONFERENCE. 



been successful in contending with it; 
and you are better prepared to battle 
with the next allurement successfully, 
though it be stronger than the first. 
And if you do not then, at some future 
time you will thank the Lord. 

There is a way by which persons can 
keep their consciences clear before God 
and man, and that is to preserve within 
them the spirit of God, which is the 
spirit of revelation to every man and 
woman. It will reveal to them, even 
in the simplest of matters, what they 
shall do, by making suggestions to 
them. We should try to learn the na- 
ture of this spirit, that we may under- 
stand its suggestions, and then we will 
always be able to do right. This is the 
grand privilege of every Latter-day 
Saint. We know that it is our right 
to have the manifestations of the spirit 
every day of our lives. Persons come 
to me very anxious to receive counsel 
upon some subject or other. They need 
nolt come to me always (under some 
circumstances, of course, it would be 
highly proper), for the spirit is within 
them to bring about good and to ac- 
complish the purposes of God. The 
spirit is in every man and every woman 
so that they need not walk in the dark- 
ness at all, and it is not always neces- 
sary for them to come to the President 
of the Church, or to the Twelve, or to 
the Elders of Israel, to get counsel; 
they have it within them; there is a 
friend that knows just exactly what to 
say to them. From the time we re- 
ceive the Gospel, go down into the wa- 
ters of baptism and have hands laid 
upon us afterwards for the gift of the 
Holy Ghost, we have a friend, if we 
do not drive it from us by doing wrong. 
That friend is the Holy Spirit, the Holy 
Ghost, which partakes of the things of 
God and shows them unto us. This is 
a grand means that the Lord has pro- 
vided for us, that we may know the 
light, and not be groveling continually 
in the dark. 

I wanted to say these few words, as 
they were suggested to me while 
Brother Young was addressing 
us. God bless you, Latter-day 
Saints, and my friends who are 
here, who have honest hearts. 
God bless you and crown you with His 
Holy Spirit, that you may know that 
the time has come when the Lord has 



called a people to prepare for the com- 
ing of the Son of God, who shall appear 
and be in our midst, and teach us the 
mysteries of the kingdom. 

God bless you and preserve you all 
in the holy path of righteousness, ex- 
altation and glory, is my prayer in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem, 

"Let the Mountains Shout for Joy." 

Benediction by Elder Joseph W. Mc- 
Murrin. 



OVERFLOW MEETING. 
2 p. m.. 

An overflow meeting was held in the 
Assembly Hall, at which Elder John 
W. Taylor, of the quorum of the Apos- 
tles, presided. 

The Temple choir and congregation 
sang : 

Now let us rejoice in the day of salva- 
tion, 

No longer as strangers on earth need 
we roam. 

Prayer was offered by Elder F. A. 
Hammond of San Juan Stake. 
The choir sang the hymn: 

I know that my Redeemer lives. 
What comfort this sweet sentence gives. 

ELDER JONATHAN G. KIMBALL. 

I have been very much interested 
during this semi-annual conference. 
Personally, I cannot remember the time 
when I have been more pleased with 
the discourses. There is one grand 
feature connected with them that has 
forced itself upon my mind. It is. 
"Seek ye first the kingdom of God and 
His righteousness and all other things 
shall be added unto you." I remember 
instances when temporal matters 
seemed to be foremost. I comprehend 
as well as others how necessary it is 
that we should have temporal things 
brought to our attention. Sometimes I 
have felt a little in doubt which should 
be the most prominent at present, our 
temporal salvation, or our spiritual sal- 
vation, and I have been unable to say 
which should be first. Some of our peo- 
ple are in a regretable condition, and 
much has been said upon this question 
and it has seemed quite a hobby with 
me as I have passed through that ex- 
perience, but I will not take time to say 
anything upon that feature. Our people 
should follow the instructions that have 
been given them and keep out of debt. 



ELDER JONATHAN G. KIMBALL. 



53 



I call to mind a saying- of the Lord: "I 
am bound when ye do what I say, but 
when ye do not what I say, then ye 
have no promise." He says to the 
young people: "He that seeketh me 
early shall find me, and he shall not be 
forsaken." The Lord has made great 
and wonderful promises to this people. 

I desire to call your attention to an 
incident that occurred when I was la 
boring in the Southern States, in 1884. 
I went there in 1883. The year 1884 was a 
time of a sad experience in that mis- 
sion. It was then that some of our El- 
ders lost their lives by mob violence. It 
seemed that there was bitterness on all 
hands. We had but few friends. I was 
at the office in Chattanooga under El- 
der Roberts at the time. I picked up a 
Chattanooga Times one morning, and I 
was very much delighted to see in 
print these words, speaking of Elder 
John Morgan. It said, "To shake his 
hand was to be his friend." I have 
never forgotten it. When you shook 
John Morgan's hand and he looked into 
your face you always knew that you 
were his friend. John Morgan under- 
stood that principle. Some of our peo- 
ple are becoming careless in the shak- 
ing of hands. I have shaken hands with 
some men, when I would just as soon 
have put my hand into a bucket of ice 
water as to shake hands with them. 
They may have been friendly, but I 
have no means of telling. Great ser- 
mons have been preached in this Church 
by the simple shaking of hands; and 
you who have been in holy places; you 
who have been in the holy temple, know 
what it means to shake hands. 

I witnessed a play in the Theater 
here, and was very much taken up with 
it— Julius Caeser — and when I saw the 
mimic representatives of great Romans 
walk up and shake hands, I presume 
every one in that large Theater was im- 
pressed with the idea that it meant 
friendship. But we have been too much 
carried away with temporal matters. 
When our Elders come home— we have 
probably eight hundred who return 
every year— they ask me what is the 
matter with the people? They discover 
it whenever they shake hands with you. 
When you meet the Elders that come 
home and shake hands with them, they 
will hardly let go of your hand, they 
are so friendly, and you can feel it in 



your hearts that they love you. They 
do it from the bottom of their hearts. 
You, who have lost children know when 
a person comes up to you and sym- 
pathizes with you on account of your 
loss, taking you by the hand and look- 
ing you in the face, notwithstanding 
they do not utter a word, you feel that 
friendship, that sympathy that pierces 
to the innermost recesses of your hearts. 
Those who have lost wives, if one who 
has passed through that terrible ex- 
perience comes to sympathize with an- 
other man who has lost his wife, in 
shaking his hand there is a feeling of 
friendship and sympathy that cannot 
be expressed in words. 

Brethren and sisters, we can afford to 
be sympathetic; we can afford of all 
people on the earth to be filled with 
sympathy and compassion. I am not 
concerned very much about what other 
religionists do. We have the Gospel of 
the Lord Jesus Christ, and it has with- 
stood every test. We have sent out our 
young Elders without experience, and it 
is marvelous, it is wonderful, it is one 
of the great testimonies to me how 
these young men can meet the men of 
the world as they do, with so little ex- 
perience. It is a very strong evidence 
that we have the truth, that we have 
the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. I 
am not concerned about the Christian 
Scientists; I have little to say against 
them. If they do any good that is theh 
business, but I wish to say that there 
will be inroads made among this people. 
I call to mind now a circumstance of a 
Josephite preacher going into the city 
of Logan, among the intelligent people 
there, and going from house to house. 
It was discovered that our people were 
unable to meet him. He went to a 
Bishop's place, and he spoke unkindly 
to him, and a young Elder who had 
just returned from the East said: 
"Father, I am unwilling to stand by and 
hear that man talk as he is talking, and 
I will meet him in public debate," and 
he vaniFhed, and that man did not wish 
to see him any more. We must be in- 
formed. No church can find a more 
successful way of making in- 
roads among our people than 
by getting them to extend the 
hand of sympathy, love, and 
affection in their trials and tribulations. 
We, who hold the priesthood, Elders, 



5* 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Seventies, Teachers, and Deacons — 
ought to perform our duties; our hearts 
are noit always as they should be; we do 
not always exhibit the sympathy, lov<» 
and affection that we ought. I am 
sorry to say that some of my acquaint- 
ances, siome who are near and dear to 
me, have been won from our Church 
through love and sympathy. 

My brethren and sisters, I have this to 
say in conclusion: Even if you are in 
a hurry, stop and shake hands before 
going on, but do it right ; have the spirit 
of God within you, and when you greet 
them say, "God bless you." I know a 
good old sister, who is working for her 
living; she would not let the Church 
support her, she is too proud. She i» 
over 70 years old. She said to me that 
when an Apostle took her by the hand 
and said "God bless you" it was worth 
more to her than all the money they 
could give her. I remember Apostle 
Erastus Snow, and I will never forget 
him as long as I live on the earth. He 
stopped long enough to take me by 
the hand as a boy, after my father was 
dead, and said "God bless you." There 
are others that have done so, and they 
stand foremost in my mind, and I re- 
member and esteem every one of them. 
"We should learn to love and honor each 
other. We should have the spirit of 
God burning within our hearts. You 
can make more converts in this way 
than by any other means. God bless 
you. Amen. 

The choir sang: 
"Who are these arrayed in white?" 

ELDER RULON S. WELLS. 
My brethren and sisters: I also re- 
joice in the spirit of this conference; 
and I can say that it has been very 
enjoyable to me. It is the first general 
conference that I have had the privilege 
of attending for three years. Since that 
time it has been my privilege to labor 
in foreign lands, among strange people; 
but I rejoice all the more in coming 
back into the union of the Church, as- 
sociating with the Saints, and mingling 
my testimony with those of my breth- 
ern to the truth of the work in which 
we are engaged. I rejoice in the prog- 
ress of the work of God. I rejoice in 
the great advancement made by the 
Latter-ady Saints. While there is plen- 



ty of room for improvement, yet we dis- 
cover a great deal of progress being 
made among those who are really in 
earnest and are keeping the command- 
ments of God — these are marching on 
toward the goal we all desire to reach. 

What does preaching amount to if it 
is not put into practice by the Latter- 
day Saints; if we do not profit by the 
instructions which we receive? Every 
one who has heard the voices of the 
prophets of God, the holy apostles, and 
the instructions they have given during 
this conference, and has not determined 
within himself to benefit by them, will 
receive no good from them. They will 
simply be as a sounding brass and as 
a tinkling cymbal, so far as any benefit 
being derived from them is concerned. 
But if we will put into practice the 
principles we have been taught, and 
if we will yield obedience to the coun- 
sels that have been given, and live in 
accordance with the spirit that has 
been made manifest in this conference, 
then we will go onward and progress in 
the knowledge of God, and will prepare 
ourselves for the coming of our Savior. 

I was particularly impressed with the, 
remarks of the brethren in regard to 
the treatment that should be extended 
to those who are converted, and immi- 
grate to Zion. It has been observed by 
many, and I have also observed it, that 
numbers of our new converts do not re- 
ceive the kind reception they should. 
They come from foreign lands where 
they have received the Gospel, and the 
first love of the Gospel is burning with- 
in their hearts; they have been filled 
with a greaJt warmth of love towards 
our brethren and sisters, and in their 
far distant homes the spirit of gather- 
ing has come upon them and they have 
resolved to come to the land of Zion. 
They have been filled with a desire to 
cast their lot with the people of God, 
that they might learn more of His 
ways; that they might be taught the 
will of the Lord and learn to do it bet- 
ter, and that they might mingle with 
Latter-day Saints — men and women of 
God. Those have been their desires. 
They have sold out their little posses- 
sions in the foreign lands, have for- 
saken their native countries, bid adieu 
to the prospects of their youth, and 
have severed their communications 
with them in order that they might 



ELDER RULON S. HELLS. 



55 



mingle with us. What has been the re- 
ception of many that have come up un- 
to the land of Zion.? Instead of re- 
ceiving that hearty and warm shake of 
the hand that Brother Kimball has been 
speaking of, they have not in many in- 
stances even received one of those cold 
greetings that have been referred to. 
They have felt a lack of that warmth 
of feeling that should be extended to 
them, and they have thought that lovfc 
was not abounding in our midst. I 
think it is time the attention of the 
Latter-day Saints was called to their 
indifference toward each other — they 
should learn to be brethren and sisters 
in very deed. I endorse the remarks of 
Brother Kimball in regard to this mat- 
ter. I think when our Saints come 
here attention should be paid to them. 
I was pleased to hear the remarks of 
President Snow when he stated that 
some one would be appointed to look 
after these matters. It should be done 
in every ward in Zion, that when they 
come they may find that they are cared 
for. I am aware that a great many of 
the Latter-day Saints have felt the ne- 
cessity for this, and I am aware, too, 
that a great deal is being done; but I 
feel in my heart that a great deal more 
could be done to make the reception we 
extend to our Saints more cheerful and 
warm. It is not always necessary to 
extend to them financial aid, but they 
should be made to feel that they are 
among their friends, their brethren and 
sisters. A little kindness, a little con- 
sideration, a simple visit, or an invita- 
tion, will often be the means of mak- 
ing them happy. It is the experience 
of missionaries in the field to find many 
of those who have come here to Zion, 
who have become dissatisfied through 
a lack of this warmth and affection, 
writing back to their friends concern- 
ing it; and in some cases the letters 
they write are too true. Of course 
they have happened to fall 
amongst those who are not 
abounding in that love and re- 
gard they should have for one another. 
When our Savior was upon the earth 
He preached upon this subject, as also 
did His apostles after Him. They ex 
horted the Saints then to love one on- 
other, to be kind to one another and to 
be full of consideration one for the 
other. The first great commandment 



was that "we should love the Lord with 
all our might, mind, and strength," and 
the second, like unto it, was that "we 
should love our neighbor as ourself.' 
If that love abounds in the hearts of the 
people, it will make itself manifest 
among them. We read in the scriptures 
that "out of the abundance of the heart 
the mouth speaketh." We should give 
expression to the kind feelings that are 
within us, and should cultivate the 
spirit of the Gospel towards one an- 
other. We should learn to profit by 
these principes that have been re- 
vealed to us, for they are the power of 
God unto salvation. If we simply ac- 
cept them with our minds, but do not 
practice them in our lives, they will not 
save us. If we will practice them, 
they will purify our hearts and bring 
us to a knowledge of God, "whom to 
know is life eternal." 

I bear my testimony unto you my 
brethren and sisters that I do know 
that this Gospel is the Gospel of the 
Lord Jesus, that it has been restored 
through the Prophet Joseph Smith for 
the salvation of the human family. 1 
know that this is the truth by the re- 
velations of God to me through His 
Holy Spirit; and I will say to the Lat- 
ter-day Saints, as was said to the for- 
mer day Saints by one of the Apostlee 
that "if we walk in the light as he is 
in the light, then we will have fellow- 
ship >ne for another, and the blood of 
Jesus Christ will cleanse us from ah 
sin." In order to walk in the light, we 
must enjoy the light of the spirit of 
God, for that is the light that should 
lighten our path, and that should lead 
us onward to our salvation; and we can 
enjoy that only as we are yielding obe- 
dience to the principles of the ever- 
lasting Gospel and listening to the 
counsels of God through His servants, 
for we are told that "we should live 
not by bread alone, but by every word 
that proceedeth out of the mouth of 
God;" and the words of God are those 
that are spoken through the inspira- 
tion of His Holy Spirit by those whom 
he has called to administer His word 
unto the people. 

May the Lord bless us with noble and 
worthy ambitions and with a determin- 
ation to improve our lives; and let the 
love of truth burn within us, and also 
the love of our fellowmen. Let us do 



56 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



what we can for the onward progress 
of the kingdom of God, for it is a great 
honor that has been conferred upon us, 
in that we have received the Gospel, 
and in that we have been chosen ot 
God to be instruments in His hands to 
disseminate a knowledge of the truth 
among the nations of the earth. May 
the Lord help us to be worthy of the 
trust He has imposed on us; may He 
help us to improve the time and talents 
which He has bestowed upon us to tho 
interest of His kingdom; may we all 
seek first the kingdom of God and His 
righteousness, and I promise you, in the 
name of the Lord, that all other things, 
prosperity, happiness, comfort, and 
wealth, will be given unto us, in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. ■ 
Sister Emma Ramsey then sang: 

Gome all ye sons of Zion, 
And let us praise the Lord. 



ELDER A. O. WOODRUFF. 

I will read a few verses from the 28th 
chapter of Second Nephi: 

"And, now behold my brethren I 
have spoken unto you as the spirit hath 
constrained me, wherefore, I know that 
they shall surely come to pass. 

"The things which shall be written 
out of the book shall be of great worth 
unto the children of men, and especialy 
unto our seed, which is a remnant of 
the house of Israel. 

"For it shall come to pass in that day 
that the churches which are built up 
and not unto the Lord, when the one 
shall say unto the other, Behold I, I am 
the Lord's; and the others shall say I 
I am the Lord's. And thus shall every 
one say that hath built up churches, 
and not unto the Lord." 

Those who profess in the world to be 
ministers of Christ, are fulfilling this 
prophecy to the very letter. It appears 
that the ministers who profess to be 
the teachers of Christ's doctrine in this 
city and other parts where our peo- 
ple are located, have made a specialty 
of preaching the doctrine that the gifts 
and blessings which follow the believer 
have been done away. The Lord has 
said that certain signs should follow 
the believer, and this people knows that 
these signs and that these blessings 
which were to follow a true faith, a 
true repentance, a true baptism, and a 



true laying on of hands for the recep- 
tion of the Holy Ghost, are found in the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints today. When men who profess 
to be ministers of Christ stand up and 
teach the people otherwise they are 
manifesting the spirit of anti-Christ— 
they are teaching anti-Christ doctrine. 
They are not teaching the doctrine that 
Paul referred to when he said: "Though 
we or an angel from heaven preach any 
other Gospel unto you than that which 
we have preached unto you, let him be 
accursed." They are not preaching that 
Gospel which is the power of God unto 
salvation unto them that believe. They 
are preaching the doctrine and are re- 
presenting the churches that have been 
built up to the honor of men— to the 
honor of Peter, of Paul, of Luther, of 
Zwingle, and other reformers— men who 
lived in former times. They are not 
teaching the one faith, the one Lord 
and the one baptism which Jesus 
preached when He was upon the earth. 
Just so long as God acknowledges His 
Church upon the earth the signs will 
follow the believer. I am glad to know 
that this is an individual work; that 
we have not to depend upon the testi- 
mony of Peter, of Paul, of Mark, or of 
Matthew, or any of those who lived in 
the days of Christ, to enjoy and have a 
testimony of this work. I thank God 
that every one that has arrived to the 
years of accountability, can know that 
this work is of God. When men seek 
to teach the people that these gifts have 
been done away, that they were simply 
necessary to establish the Church in 
ancient times, and that they have now 
been done away, they deny the scrip- 
tures. We are told in holy writ, "seek 
ye in the scriptures, for in them ye 
think ye have eternal life, and see if 
they are not they which testify of me." 
The scriptures testify that these signs 
should follow the believer. Peter 
taught it upon the day of Pentecost, 
telling the people if they would repent of 
their sins, and be baptized for the re- 
mission of them, they should receive 
the Holy Ghost, and these gifts would 
be made manifest unto them. When 
Peter and the other Apostles stood up 
before the people they taught the doc 
trine of the Lord Jesus unto them; but 
today men say these things are done 
away. It has been taught in the world,

and in some of the sectarian churches 
in this city within the last few weeks 
that Abraham was an ignorant man; 
that God overlooked sin and crime in 
his case because of his degeneracy and 
ignorance. It is remarkable that we 
live in a time when those who profess to 
be the followers of Christ will ridicule 
the man whom the Lord held up and 
called righteous, and call him degener- 
ate and ignorant; he who was held up 
through the mission of Christ as a per- 
fect man, the father of the faithful. 
There are anti-Christs among this peo- 
ple; we hear anti-Christ doctrine from 
time to time — doctrine which is not in 
accordance with any of the scriptures 
that have been handed down to us, nor 
in accordance with the teachings of the 
Apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ. Our 
people should be warned of these doc- 
trines, the doctrines of devils and of 
men, that are taught in some of the 
congregations of the world today by 
those who profess to be the followers 
of Christ — Spiritualists, Christian 
Scientists and others. Those who ad- 
vocate them claim that they are 
Christ's. But they do not teach the 
doctrine of Christ? They deny the car- 
dinal doctrines our Savior taught while 
He was upon the earth. Why don't 
they teach the one Lord, the one faith, 
and the one baptism that was taught 
by our Savior and His disciples? Why 
is it that they deny faith in the true 
and living God — a God with body, parts 
and passions. How is it that they deny 
these things? Why do they deny true 
baptism? Jesus says, "Except ye ara 
born of the water and of the spirit ye 
cannot enter into the kingdom of God." 
If they believe in the doctrine of Jesus 
Christ, why do they spiritualize awa> 
the resurrection, the fundamental doc- 
trine which Jesus taught while He was 
upon the earth? I say our people should 
beware of them. Where can you find 
Latter-day Saints that have become dis- 
contented with our doctrines, that have 
joined any of these sects that have been 
instituted by men, if they have been 
faithful and kept themselves free from 
the sins of the world; there is 
a cause for apostacy; there is a cause 
for sin; there is a cause for rebellion; 
there is a cause for disobedience. They 
do not come by chance. It is all right 
to prove all things and hold fast to that 



which is good, but we should be estab- 
lished in the doctrine of the Lord 
Jesus Christ; we should have a testi- 
mony of the divinity of this work, for 
it is God's work and He will see it 
through. He will cause that it shall 
triumph over everything that is man- 
made; and He will choose those things 
which seem to be naught to bring to 
naught those that be. 
God bless you. Amen. 

ELDER RUDGER CLAWSON. 

My brethren and sisters: This idea 
of having short speeches and songs 
interspersed meets my mind exactly. 
It is an arrangement which seems to 
please the people. In Boxelder Stake 
we have our opening exercises, then 
we have the sacrament, after the sac- 
rament singing again, then a short 
sermon, then a song, then another 
short sermon, and after that the con- 
cluding exercises; and that generally 
brings us to half past three, and we 
close our meeting. This is a custom we 
follow at all times, except during our 
conferences, when we go a little be- 
yond that hour. When this meeting 
shall have closed you will remember 
that the Temple choir has done a great 
deal in helping to make it interesting 
an<3 instructive. 

I sat in the Tabernacle and looked 
out upon the vast congregation of 
Saints, I was impressed with the re- 
mark of President Cannon when he re- 
minded us that the Church had grown 
from a small beginning, from an or- 
ganization of six members in the year 
1830, to what we witness today. I re- 
member the time when President 
Young was in our midst, and a large 
canvas was stretched through the cen- 
tre of the Tabernacle, and at confer- 
ence time there were no more people 
assembled to hear the instructions of 
the servants of God than we have in 
this hall today. We now have this 
congregation and an immense con- 
gregation assembled in the Tabernacle, 
and I see hundreds of people passing 
back and forth; and there are hun- 
dreds of Saints upon the streets of Salt 
Lake City at this moment walking 
back and forth, and visiting among 
their friends. And there are other 
hundreds of people that could not come 
to this conference being detained at

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



home owing to the lateness of the 
season, as they are putting in their 
seeds, trimming their trees, and putting 
things in order. We have grown to be 
a mighty people in the midst of the 
Rocky Mountains; and the peculiarity 
of it all is that this people are held to- 
gether. You go down into the Utah 
Stake of Zion, meet with ihe people 
there in conference, and you will find 
the same spirit prevailing in their midst 
as we have witnessed at this general 
conference. If you go up into the Box- 
elder Stake you will find the same spirit 
prevailing there. If you go down to 
Old Mexico and meet with the Saints in 
that part of the country, there will be 
the same good spirit of the Gospel; and 
so in Canada, and in all parts of the 
Church. How is it that this people are 
not wandering away into false doctrines 
and into heresies and becoming dark- 
ened in their minds and contending one 
with another? It is the marvelous 
power of God that holds them together. 
I used to wonder, years ago, how it 
would be when the Church grew in 
numbers and spread out, filling the 
land north and south, east and west — 
how they could be held together and 
kept as one people having one faith, one 
baptism and one understanding of the 
Gospel. There is no power under the 
heavens that could accomplish this 
wonderful thing but the power of God; 
and it is a testimony to me of the truth 
of this great work. If I saw nothing 
else about it, this would be convincing 
to me. We are established in the moun- 
tains, and the character of our organ- 
ization, the character of our teachings, 
the character of our temporal work, is 
such that we are attracting the notice 
of the world; and the rich men, and the 
learned,and the d gnitaries o" this world 
who go forth and visit from place to 
place, feel that their, journey is not 
complete until they have visited Zion. 
They come into our meetings and learn 
something of our doctrine or organiza- 
tion; they go out upon our streets, 
visit the lake, and they see that wonder- 
ful building there; they go into our 
Tabernacle and are entertained there by 
musical selections from the great organ, 
and observe the remarkable accous- 
tic properties of that building; they 
go out and look upon our Temple, and 
they see a building there that is fifty 



years ahead of the times, and it must 
surprise them greatly when they learn 
that that building was commenced in 
the days of poverty, and in the days of 
the afflictions of this people. But the 
grandeur of that building, which is es- 
timated to have cost between three and 
four million dollars. The beauty of its 
finish, the richness of its furnishings, 
are nothing compared to the spirit that 
you find in that building. Strangers 
who look upon it and contemplate the 
work of the Latter-day Saints, have no 
conception of the spirit that 
dwells in that holy Temple. When 
the Saints go into that build- 
ing they are at first impressed 
by its surroundings, by the spacious- 
ness of the rooms, and the beauty of 
the furnishings; but after awhile they 
forget all that; they have no time to 
think about the building, they are so 
deeply impressed by the spirit that is 
there. A place where they can enter 
and leave the world behind them. They 
are not troubled in that house by the 
cares and the anxieties and the troubles 
of this world. The world seems to be 
far beneath them. They have no time to 
think about it. They are swallowed up 
in the spirit and power of God. In re- 
flecting, I have been struck with the 
idea that had it not been for the con- 
descension of God to His servant 
Joseph Smith the prophet, that magni- 
ficent building would be of little use to 
us, as there would have been no occa- 
sion to build it. We could not have used 
it if we had had it. Its arrangement 
is such that it would be good for no 
other purpose except the purpose de- 
signed by our Father — the performance 
of vicarious ordinance work for the liv- 
ing and for the dead. And it is through 
the blessing, mercy, and condescension 
of the Lord that we enjoy these bless- 
ings, and that we are permitted to go 
into the house of God; and that we are 
permitted to receive the Priesthood and 
go forth and work out our salvation in 
fear and trembling. 

I rejoice in these things, and I am 
truly thankful to be associated with 
you in this work of God. I have a de- 
sire in my heart to magnify the Priest- 
hood and to follow counsel. I know 
there is safety in counsel. With the 
little experience I have had in the 
world, I have been delivered from many

difficulties, I have been protected and 
shielded from harm, by following ad- 
vice. I know that my Priesthood, my 
calling and the authority that God has 
given unto me, will be of little use in 
this world except I shall be submis- 
sive and willing to follow counsel. Let 
us reflect upon these things. Let us be 
wise in our day and generation, that 
God may be pleased to accept of our 
labors and crown us heirs with His 
Saints in His kingdom. I trust that 
this may be the case, in the name of 
Jesus. Amen. 

The choir sang "Along the river of 
time we glide," after which 

ELDER MATTHIAS F. COWLEY. 

My brethren and sisters: I desire 
your faith and prayers for the few mo- 
ments that I shall occupy. I have very 
much rejoiced in the teachings of this 
conference, including this meeting; and 
the beautiful songs of praise which 
have been rendered, must of necessity 
impress the hearts of Latter-day Saints 
with the spirit of spiritual refinement, 
and tend to lead us to exercise our 
thoughts and influence our acts, when 
we shall leave this conference, in a 
strong devotion to the cause which we 
are so honored as to be identified with. 

I desire to ask m.y brethren and sis- 
ters, and in order to be consistent, I 
will covenant with you, (as we shall get 
the reports of this conference) to read 
carefully all the instructions which 
have been given by President Snow, 
his counselors, the Twelve Apost- 
les, and the presiding council of the 
Seventies, whose representatives are 
with us in this meeting, and that we 
shall digest at our leisure the counsel 
which has been imparted. The instruc- 
tions are important, and their propriety 
should be a testimony to us that they 
have been dictated by the inspiration 
of the Lord. We have been instructed 
at this conference with teachings that 
should lead us to respect and venerate 
the Father and the Son, and to cherish 
with profound respect the name of the 
Prophet Joseph Smith, and also his 
successors down to the present admin- 
istration of the affairs of the Church. 
We have been counselled to utilize the 
means, the material substance with 
which the Lord has so generously 



blessed us in these mountain valleys, 
more liberally in the advancement of 
the work of God upon the earth. In 
connection with this we ought to en- 
courage the work for the salvation of 
the dead. Our contributions to the 
temples ought to be more liberal; and 
the Saints who are home, and es- 
pecially those who have been blessed 
with means and have considerable 
leisure, ought to go to the Temples in 
their respective districts and work 
for the redemption of the dead. 
If you have not names in 
the line of your own family genealogy, 
there is an abundance of genealogical 
records which have been prepared by 
the inspiration of the Lord upon the 
hearts of men, not Latter-day Saints. 
Since the Prophet Elijah visited the 
Kirtland Temple and turned the keys 
of salvation for the dead, that spirit 
has brooded not only in the hearts of 
the Latter-day Saints, but it has op- 
erated largely in the hearts of men who 
do not understand the spirit which 
actuated them to write genealogical 
histories. We ought to work for the 
redemption of the dead. 

We have been cited by President 
Snow and others of the brethren to the 
necessity of paying our tithing, and we 
have been reminded that this law has 
been established to some extent as a 
source of education, to bring us to the 
observance of the higher law — the law 
of consecration. Zion can only be re- 
deemed upon that law. Now, if we 
would come to that higher law, we 
must act upon the law of tithing, and 
we must pay our tithes honestly and 
fully in order to secure the blessings 
which are attached to that sacred re- 
quirement which God has established 
as a law in His Church. We have been 
reminded at this conference by numbers 
of the brethren that we should utilize 
the temporal blessings which have 
come to us in making the Latter-day 
Saints more of a self-sustaining people. 
I do not understand the design of God 
to be that His Saints shall be depend- 
ant upon any nation. I do understand 
that the decree has gone forth that 
Babylon shall fall — Babylon, the mother 
of harlots and the abomination of all 
the earth. Suppose her institutions 
should fail, and we should be cut off 
from that communication with the out- 



60 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



side world that we now possess, what 
is our condition so far as material in- 
terests are concerned? We do not man- 
ufacture clothing enough to clothe our 
people; we do not manufacture boots 
and shoes enough for footwear; 
we do not manufacture the head-gear 
that adorns and shades the heads of the 
men and women of this Church. We do 
not utilize the elements with which the 
Lord has so abundantly blessed this 
land and work them into utensils that 
are essential for the benefit of the peo- 
ple as we should do. The time is com- 
ing when God will require us to do it, 
when He will require that the apparel 
and other articles of usefulness shall 
be of the workmanship of our hands, 
and it is the duty of the Latter-day 
Saints to use the manufactured mater- 
ials that can be produced in this land 
by our own efforts. I do not think that 
we should be a covenant breaking peo- 
ple. I remember a few years ago, 
when Brother John W. Taylor and my- 
self lived in the Fourteenth ward, on a 
certain occasion his father, Elder Or- 
son Pratt, and Elder George Q. Cannon 
came to a meeting in that ward and 
they read to us what was designated 
as the fourteen rules of the united or- 
der, and there were a great many truths 
enunciated in that document. We made 
solemn covenants that we would ob- 
serve the Sabbath day and keep it holy, 
and that we would not justify our 
young people in going to pleasure re- 
sorts upon that day; that we would not 
justify them in profanity, nor in the 
use of any unbecoming language. We 
made covenants that we would not take 
the name of the Deity in vain nor speak 
lightly of His character nor of sacred 
things. We made solemn covenants 
that we would sustain one another in 
our material interests, and that we 
would utilize the means which God had 
placed in our hands to manufacture the 
articles that were necessary for our use 
in the establishing of the work of God 
in this land. A great many other cov- 
enants were made, and we lifted up 
our hands in solemnity before God, just 
as we have done this afternoon to sus- 
tain the Prophet of God and his associ- 
ates, who have been called to be the liv- 
ing oracles of God unto this Church. 
I will read a passage or two of 
scripture to show the responsibility 



we are under, and then I will close. 
I wish to say to the Elders of Israel 
that when they are called upon to bear 
testimony, or preach the Gospel at 
home or abroad, they are forbidden to 
do so, except through the prayer of 
faith, they receive the spirit of God and 
preach by the power of that spirit. In 
speaking of those who are called upon 
to preach the Gospel, it says they 
"shall reason and expound the scrip- 
tures unto them. 

"And, behold, and lo, this is an en- 
sample unto all those who were or- 
dained unto this Priesthood whose mis- 
sion is appointed unto them to go forth; 

"And this is the ensample unto them, 
that they shall speak as they are moved 
upon by the Holy Ghost, and 
whatsoever they should speak when 
moved upon by the Holy Ghost, 
shall be scripture, shall be the will of 
the Lord, shall be the mind of the Lord, 
shall be the word of the Lord, shall be 
the voice of the Lord, and the power of 
God unto salvation." Doc. and Gov. Sec. 
68. 2-4.) 

Young brethren and sisters, what you 
have heard President Snow say in re- 
gard to doing the will of the Lord, 
no matter what the world might say 
was the will of the Lord, the 
voice of the Lord, and will be the power 
of God unto salvation unto all who have 
the integrity of heart and the courage 
to obey it. And whatsoever counsel is 
given by the Bishops, by the Presidents 
of Stakes, by the presiding authorities 
in every department is the word and 
will of the Lord when they are actuated 
by the light and intelligence of the 
Holy Spirit. "Behold, you are they who 
are ordained of me, and ordained 
priests and teachers." This calling, 
speaking of the Twelve, "is to declare 
my Gospel by the power of the Holy 
Ghost, which is in you, and according 
to the callings and gifts of God, unto 
men." This is the way they are to do 
it — by the spirit and revelation of Al- 
mighty God. "Wherefore, lift up your 
voice and spare not." We are not to 
spare or neglect. It is the duty of the 
servants of God in every capacity to 
declare the truth and not mince it. 
"Wherefore, lift up your voice and 
spare not, for the Lord, God, hath 
spoken. Therefore, prophecy, and it 
shall be given by the power of the Holy 
Ghost." 

"And again the Elders, Priests and 



ELDER JO HIS IV TAYLOR. 



61 



Teachers of this Church shall teach the 
principles of my Gospel, which are in 
the Bible and in the Book of Mormon, 
in the which is the fulness of the Gos- 
pel; 

"And they shall observe the coven- 
ants and Church articles to do them 
and these shall be their teachings, 
as they shall be directed by the spirit; 

"And the spirit shall be given unto 
you by the prayer of faith, and .if ye re- 
ceive not the spirit, ye shall not teach." 

I might read many more verses, but 
this will suffice. Let us seek for the 
companionship of the Holy Spirit, that 
it may be our guide in all of our minis- 
trations and in all our ambitions, and 
in applying to our conduct the excel- 
lent counsel and instructions which 
have been given unto us during this 
conference; and inasmuch as we do this 
the spirit of Almighty God will be with 
us and the spirit and peace of the Al- 
mighty will dwell in our homes. 

Have your family prayers every night 
and every morning, and let every man, 
woman and child attend to his or her 
secret prayers, that we may come near 
unto the Lord. Pay your tithing and 
the God of heaven will bless you. May 
peace be with you my brethren and sis- 
ters, and be taken to your homes and 
rest upon your children and your 
flocks and your herds and upon the soil 
which God has given us in this choice 
land, in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER JOHN W. TAYLOR. 

Before closing, I wish to bear my tes- 
timony to what has been said, and con- 
cerning this Gospel. I know that God 
lives, and that every man and woman 
can have this testimony if they will de- 
vote themselves to God and keep His 
commandments. I know that Joseph 
Smith was a prophet of God, full of in- 
spiration, and a man that had the rev- 
elations of the Lord Jesus Christ con- 
tinually delivered unto him; that the 
gifts and blessings that were in the an- 
cient Church of Christ exist in the 
Church of Christ in our day. 

I wish to say to my young brethren 
and sisters, do not be led away by the 
sophistry of the world, "for straight is 
the gate and narrow is the way that 
leadeth unto life eternal and few there 
be that find it; and broad is the gate 



and wide is the way that leadeth to 
destruction, and many there be that go 
in thereat." If you will listen to the 
words of the Prophets of God, and will 
walk in that straight and narrow path, 
you can have a testimony of this Gos- 
pel. There are a few that enjoy these 
gifts and blessings, but it is a rare oc- 
currence where a man can go among 
this people and see these gifts and 
blessings manifest in their midst. I 
feel that there is a responsibility rest- 
ing upon this people. I will read a few 
verses, before I take my seat — the tes- 
timony of Moroni the Prophet:" 

"And by the power of the Holy Ghost 
ye may know the truth of all things. 

"And whatsoever thing is good, is 
just and true; wherefore nothing that 
is good denieth the Christ,.but acknow- 
ledged that He is. 

"And ye may know that He is by the 
power of the Holy Ghost; wherefore I 
would exhort you, that ye deny not the 
power of God; for He worketh by power 
according to the faith of the children 
of men, the same today, tomorrow and 
forever. 

"And again I exhort you my brethren, 
that ye deny not the gifts of God for 
they are many; and they come from the 
same God. And there are different ways 
that these gifts are administered; but 
it is the same God who worketh all in 
all; and they are given by the manifest- 
ations of the spirit of God unto men, 
to profit them. 

"For behold, to one is given by the 
spirit of God, that he may teach the 
word of wisdom; 

"And to another, that he may teach 
the word of knowledge by the same 
spirit; 

"And to another, exceeding great 
faith; and to another, the gifts of heal- 
ing by the same spirit. 

"And again, to another, that he may 
work mighty miracles; 

"And again, to another tnat he may 
prophecy concerning all things; 

"And again, to another, the beholding 
of angels and ministering spirits; 

"And again, to another, all kinds ot 
tongues ; 

"And again, to another, the interpre- 
tation of languages and of divers kinds 
of tongues. 

"And all these gifts come by the 
Spirit of Christ and they come unto 
every man severally, according as He 
will. 

"And I would exhort you, my beloved 
brethren, that ye remember that every 
good gift cometh of Christ. 

"And I would exhort you, my beloved 
brethren, that ye remember that He is 
the same yesterday, today and forever,

and that all these gifts of which I 
have spoken, which are spiritual, never 
will be done away, even as long as the 
world shall stand, only according to 
the unbelief of the children of men. 

"Wherefore, there must be faith; and 
if there must be faith, there must also 
be hope; and if there must be hope, 
there must also be charity; 

"And except ye have charity,ye can in 
no wise be saved in the kingdom of 
God; neither can ye be saved in the 
kingdom of God, if ye have not faith; 
neither can ye if ye have no hope; 

"And if ye have no hope, ye must 
needs be in despair; and despair cometh 
because of iniquity. 

"And Christ truly said unto our 
fathers, if ye have faith, ye can do all 
things, which is expedient unto me. 

"And now I speak unto all the ends 
of the earth, that if the day cometh that 
the power and gifts of God shall be 
done away among you, it shall be be- 
cause of unbelief." 

I admonish the Latter-day Saints to 
seek for the best gifts. Although all 
of the sects upon the face of the earth 
may say that it is unnecessary to be 
baptized in the name of Jesus Christ, 
and that it is not necessary to have 
hands laid upon them for the gift of the 
Holy Ghost, I say that the voice of the 
Redeemer of the world cries out unto 
all the nations of the earth in His testi- 
mony to Nicodemus, "Except ye be 
born of the water and of the spirit, ye 
cannot enter the kingdom of God." I 
testify unto you as an Apostle of the 
Lord Jesus Christ, and in His name 
that you will not be prepared for His 
coming if you do not enjoy the gifts 
of God. They are as free unto the chil- 
dren of men as a well of living water 
springing up unto everlasting life, . if 
they will follow the admonition of Bro- 
ther Kimball this afternoon to "seek 
first the kingdom of God and His right- 
eousness, and all other things shall be 
added unto you." What a grand and 
glorious promise! Young ladies, how 
many of you have a gift from God? 
How many of you have been clothed 
with the fire of the Holy Ghost, that ia 
as a fire burning within you ? How many 
of you enjoy a knowledge of the Lord 
Jesus Christ? How many of you young 
gentlemen are seeking after these 
things? Have you a gift from God? If 
you have not seek earnestly after these 
things, for Jesus speaking of His sec- 
ond coming, said that the kingdom of 
God would be likened unto ten virgins, 
five of whom were wis'e and five were 
foolish, and he said but half of them 



would have oil in their lamps. What is 
that oil? It is the Holy Ghost, the 
power of God unto salvation; it is that 
spirit that will lead you into the ways of 
truth; it is that spirit which partake th 
of the things of God and reveals them 
unto the children of men; it is that 
spirit that makes children obedient to 
parents. Young people, obey your par- 
ents! Parents, let us not permit that 
commandment of the Lord to go un- 
heeded: "Honor thy father and thy 
mother that thy days may be long upon 
the land which the Lord thy God giveth 
thee." Nine-tenths of the mistakes of 
this people would be corrected in the 
young if they would listen to the coun- 
sels of their fathers and mothers. Fa- 
thers and mothers are just as much en- 
titled to the revelations of God for the 
benefit of their families, as President 
Snow is for the good of the Church. 
Young people, listen to the voice of 
your fathers and your mothers! They 
love you; you are the fruit of their 
loins, and they would give their lives 
for you. And they are entitled to the 
revelations of the Lord to guide you 
into the ways of truth. Every father 
and every mother if they are doing 
their duty, will have that inspiration 
they should have, and will have that 
knowledge, to counsel their sons and 
daughters to walk in that straight and 
narrow path that leads to eternal life, 
and you will not make any mistakes if 
you will listen to their advice. 

God bless you and fill you with His 
Holy Spirit. This is a time for prepar- 
ation and not for many words. I re- 
joice that I am counted worthy to be 
in your midst at this conference, and 1 
hope that what has been said will be as> 
leaven, and will go forth among the 
people until the whole lump is leavened, 
and until the desire of all is to serve 
God and keep His commandments. 1 
feel to say God bless you and peace be 
unto you, and to your wives and to your 
children, and to the land of Zion, and 
may God temper the elements for 
the good of this people, that Zion may 
grow and increase until she shall be 
the glory of the whole earth, is my

PRESIDENT GEORGE Q. CANNON. 

Individual responsibility of the Saints— Their 
aims and hopes— Self-sacrifice a l at-is ol ex- 
altation 

To stand up before this congregation 
and attempt to speak with the hope of 
instructing them, requires, it seems to 
me, some faith. I do not think that 
any man who understands the respon- 
sibilty of a position of this character 
would attempt to do it, unless he could 
hope to have the assistance of the 
Spirit of God. 

The servants of God have spoken with 
great plainness and a large amount of 
instruction has been given in this con- 
ference, and no doubt all of us feel 
that it is one of the best conferences 
we have ever attended. I think we al- 
ways look upon the present conference 
as the best conference, and I hope we 
will be justified in this feeling by the 
spirit we shall enjoy during the re- 
mainder of the time. 

There are so many subjects that are 
intimately connected with our lives and 
with the growth and development of the 
work, that a man cannot be at a loss 
for something to say, if he has the 
Spirit of the Lord; in fact, at times the 
abundance of subjects makes it rather 
embarrassing, and it requires the dic- 
tation of the Holy Ghost to enable us to 
say those things that are suited to the 
people and their circumstances. I earn- 
estly desire, in the remarks that I shall 
make, to be dictated entirely by the 
Spirit of the Lord. I have looked at 
this large assembly, and I have thought 
what a vast variety of thought there 
must be in the breasts of those present; 
what hopes, what desires, what fears, 
what anticipations each one indulges 
in. Life to the Latter-day Saints pos- 
sesses a seriousness that I do not think 
other people feel, because of our knowl- 
edge concerning our existence here, why 
we have come here, and what lies before 
us. There is an individuality about 
the members of this Church that I do 
not think can be found elsewhere. We 
feel our individual responsibility. We 
are not taught to rely upon priests, or 



64 



GEJSERAL CONFERENCE 



teachers, or apostles, or prophets; but 
each one is taught to be responsible 
himself. In our Church the wife is not 
taught to feel that she is divested of 
responsibility, and that it rests solely 
upon her husband. Sons and daughters, 
as soon as they are capable of compre- 
hending the truth, are taught their re- 
sponsibility also. In our Sunday schools, 
in our associations, and in all the gath- 
erings of our young people, as far as 
my knowledge extends, this feature is 
kept constantly in view. Of course, 
they are taught to look for guidance, 
but not to rely upon anyone to do that 
which properly devolves upon them as 
living souls in the sight of God. They 
are impressed with their individual re- 
sponsibility. In this respect I think 
we are a peculiar people, 'different from 
every other people upon the face of the 
earth. This makes us a serious and 
thoughtful people. "We ponder careful- 
ly upon our lives, and we consider well 
our course of action. And I think this 
characteristic will grow among us. I 
hear of little children bearing testimony 
in the Sunday schools, and doing so by 
the Spirit of God; and by that they are 
made to feel their individual responsi- 
bility before the Lord. In my opin- 
ion, this is a good thing. I believe our 
future will be greatly enchanced by 
this kind of training, and we shall have 
a class of people grow up among us 
different from all others. It may be 
gradual — so gradual that we will 
scarcely notice its growth; but the 
growth will take place. 

In connection with this, the question 
arises, "What are the aims and the 
hopes of the Latter-day Saints? Why 
is it, it may be asked, that the "Mor- 
mon" people are willing to undergo 
such privations, such persecutions and 
such banishments as they have endured 
in the past, and such obloquoy, hatred 
and animosity as they do at present? 
It is a serious question for the world to 
answer, and it possesses some gravity 
for us as members of the Church of 
Christ. What are our hopes? If I were 
to ask this congregation, What has 
caused you to leave your homes and 
your friends, notwithtstanding their 
persuasions or their threats, and cast 
your lot among a people with such a 
bad name as the Latter-day Saints 
have? how different would be the an- 



swers in some respects, and yet how 
similar in other respects. The Latter- 
day Saints have been animated by 
hopes that no other people possess. Al- 
lusion was made the other day to the 
kind of heaven we anticipate. There 
are no people upon the earth who have 
such ambitious hopes and aims as the 
Latter-day Saints have. Some would 
call them irreverent. But the Lord has 
made promises to this people, and the 
Latter-day Saints believe in them. On 
that account they put their trust in the 
Lord, and are willing to endure all 
things for His sake. 
■ I will read a little from one of the 
revelations of the Lord. Speaking of 
those who receive the testimony of 
Jesus, and who overcome by faith the 
Lord says: 

"They are they which are the Church 
of the firstborn. 

"They are they into whose hands the 
Father has given all things." 

Now, these are not idle words, given 
merely to round out a sentence; but 
they are full of meaning. 

"They are they who are Priests and 
Kings, who have received of His ful- 
ness, and of His glory, 

"And are Priests of the Most High, 
after the order of Melchisedek, which 
was after the order of Enoch, which 
was after the order of the Only Begot- 
ten Son; 

"Wherefore, as it is written, they are 
Gods, even the sons of God. 

"Wherefore, all things are theirs, 
whether life or death, or things present, 
or things to come, all are theirs, and 
they are Christ's, and Christ is God's." 
—Section 76: pars. 54-59. 

Yesterday Brother Teasdale quoted 
something from section 84, which I wish 
to emphasize. These are the words: 

"And also all they who receive this 
Priesthood, receiveth me, saith the 
Lord; 

"For he that receiveth my servants, 
receiveth me; 

"And he that receiveth me receiveth 
my Father; 

"And he that receiveth my Father, 
receiveth my Father's kingdom; there- 
fore all that my Father hath shall be 
given unto him." 

Notice the last clause, "All that my 
Father hath" — not a part, but "all that 
my Father hath shall be given unto 
him." That language admits of no 
mistake. It corresponds with the other 
language that I have read in your hear- 
ing. It also corresponds with what the 
Lord says in section 93: 



PRESIDENT GEORGE Q. CANNON. 



65 



"I give unto you these sayings that 
ye may understand and know how to 
worship; and know what you 
worship; that you may come unto the 
Father in my name, and in due time 
receive of His fulness; 

"For if you keep my commandments 
you shall receive of His fulness, and be 
glorified in me as I am in the Father; 
therefore, I say unto you, you shall re- 
ceive grace for grace." 

This same revelation goes on to say: 

"The Spirit of truth is of God. I am 
the Spirit of truth, and John bore rec- 
ord of me, saying, He receiveth a full- 
ness of truth, yea, even of all truth, 

"And no man receiveth a fullness un- 
less he keepeth his commandments. 

"He that keepeth his commandments 
receiveth truth and light, until he is 
glorified in truth and knoweth all 
things." 

Time will not admit of my reading 
any more passages, but these are suffi- 
ciently plain to reveal to us that which 
God has in contemplation for His 
faithful children. The Latter-day 
Saints are promised, if they are faith- 
ful, that they shall receive the fullness, 
as Jesus received it: and Jesus received 
it as the Father received it. In the 
words of Paul, they become heirs of 
God and joint heirs with Jesus Christ. 
There is nothing that the Savior has at- 
tained unto that God's faithful children 
are not promised. They are promised 
the same blessings, the same power, 
the same authority, the same gifts, 
the same graces. I know that 
we are apt to think that heaven 
is a sort of spiritual place. It 
Is spiritual; but God our Eternal Fa- 
ther is a being of power. He controls 
the earth and the inhabitants thereof; 
He controls the elements of the earth; 
and we are promised that we shall be 
sharers with Him. He will give us an 
equal interest in all this power and 
authority. What is more desirable to 
roan, generally speaking, than to wield 
power? Mankind aim for it. To what 
lengths will ambitious men go to wield 
power, to sit upon thrones and to wield 
a sceptre of authority! History tells 
us that men have been willing to wade 
through seas of blood to gratify this 
ambition. Now, this ambition can be 
gratified righteously by keeping the 
commandments of God; and a righteous 
man will exercise righteous authority. 
That is the object God had in view in 
sending us here. Through faithfully 
keeping His commandments we may at- 



tain unto power— not illegitimate power, 
but lawful power— and wield it for our 
own exaltation and for the exaltation 
of other human beings. It is God's de- 
sign to make us priests and kings; not 
to have an empty title, not to sit upon 
thrones without power, but to be actu- 
ally and really priests and kings. The 
promise is that all things that He hath 
shall be given unto us. We will be 
His heirs; we will be (if I may use the 
term without irreverence) co-partners 
with Him in all this power and authori- 
ty. I do not know whether all the 
Latter-day Saints grasp this idea. It 
is important that we should. 

We heard some talk this morning up- 
on the principle of tithing. People won- 
der how it is that the Latter-day Saints 
pay their tithing. Some think it must 
swell the coffers of the Church and 
fatten the leaders. But they would not 
wonder if they understood the princi- 
ple. Brother Brigham Young told us 
this morning that the law of tithing 
was an inferior law. It is. The law 
of consecration is a higher law, and 
it was revealed to us, but we were not 
perpared to receive and act upon it. 
The result is, we are not doing what 
we ought to in this respect. The Lord 
requires from us consecration. Why 
does He ask you and me to conse- 
crate all we have and hold it subject 
to His will? If He is going to take us 
into partnership He wants to know in 
the first place whether we will be will- 
ing to 'do as He wants us and to share 
all that we have with Him. I was 
pleased with a little incident that oc- 
curred in my own family the other day. 
I gave two of my little children some 
money, and after a while something 
arose that caused me to need some 
money, and their mother said to these 
children, "Your father needs some 
money." The children went and got 
their banks, and said, "Here, father, 
you can have all I have in this bank." 
I was greatly delighted with the spirit 
of the children. I did not say anything, 
but I thought to myself, "That illus- 
trates the principles that Father in hea- 
ven is trying to teach us, His children. 
He gives us something, and when He 
asks for anything He wants us to be 
just as liberal as He has been in giv- 
ing it." Those who have faith and who 
rise to the comprehension of the digni- 



66 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



ty and exaltation that God intends to 
bestow upon us, will mot hesitate to 
give everything they have to the Lord, 
but it requires faith. The Lord might 
require us to lay down our lives. That 
would require faith, would it not? Yes. 
But what is the promise? That we shall 
have eternal life and be exalted in His 
presence. Therefore, those who wish to 
attain to this exaltation must cherish 
sublimity of feeling, sublimity of self- 
sacrifice. They must not only be will- 
ing to pay their tithing, but be willing 
to give everything they have got on 
the earth — wives and children, and 
everything else. If I cannot give up my 
wife and all my children, if required, — 
if I cannot lay down my life, if nec- 
essary, God help me! I do not know 
what I might do, but God help me to 
do it if the test ever comes. But if I 
am not willing to do this, I cannot hope 
to attain to that exaltation and re- 
ceive that fullness which the Lord has 
promised unto us, if we are faithful. 

Therefore, shall we hesitate about 
tithing? Shall we hesitate about any- 
thing else, with such objects in view 
and with such righteous ambition as 
God has implanted in our hearts? No, 
we cannot hesitate if we have faith. 
The world say: "Oh, you are led by 
priests, who are dominating you and 
tyrannizing over vou, and using you for 
their own purposes." But what has 
God said? what has He promised to us? 
That is the question for us to ask. We 
must not look at what the world says; 
it is what God says that we must act 
upon. And I say to you this day, in the 
presence of God and the holy angels 
and of this assembly, if we expect to 
attain the fulfillment of the promises 
God has made to us, we must be self- 
sacrificing. There is no sacrifice that 
God can ask of us, or His servants 
whom He has chosen to lead us, that 
we should hesitate about making. In 
one sense of the word, it is no sacrifice. 
We may call it so, because it comes in 
contact with our selfishness and our un- 
belief; but it ought not to come in con- 
tact with our faith. The infidel says, 
'What a monster God was to ask Ab- 
raham to offer up his only son as a sac- 
rifice — to ask him to break a law which 
He Himself had given to man, wherein 
He said, Thou shalt not kill." That law 
was embodied in the ten command- 
ments, but it dated back to the early 



days of man upon the earth. Human 
life was sacred; God had made it so. 
He had made murder the worst crime 
that could be committed by man 
against his fellow man. The curse 
that He pronounced upon Cain is felt 
by his descendants to this day, so 
grievious was his sin in the sight of 
God. But that God who gave this com- 
mand to His children on earth required 
His servant Abraham to take his son, 
go into a high mountain, and there of- 
fer him up as a sacrifice. At the same 
time it was contrary to the law of God 
to offer human sacrifice. God had pro- 
hibited it. It was a grievious sin among 
the idolatrous nations. Abraham's own 
kindred indulged in that wicked prac- 
tice. He tells in his record that vir- 
gins were sacrificed on altars in the 
land of his nativity, and he himself 
was bound on an altar to be sacrificed, 
his kindred doubtless submitting to it. 
but an angel of God delivered him. But 
here comes the command of God to this 
man who has been taught so scrupu- 
lously about the sinfulness of murder 
and human sacrifice, to do these very 
things. Now, why did the Lord ask 
such things of Abraham? Because, 
knowing what his future would be and 
that he would be the father of an in- 
numerable posterity, he was determined 
to test him. God did not do this for 
His own sake; for He knew by His 
foreknowledge what Abraham would 
do; but the purpose was to impress up- 
on Abraham a lesson, and to enable 
him to attain unto knowledge that he 
could not obtain in any other way. 
That is why God tries all of us. It is 
mot for His own knowledge; for He 
knows all things beforehand. He 
knows all your lives and everything 
you will do. But He tries us for our 
own good, that we may know ourselves; 
for it is most important that a man 
should know himself. He required 
Abraham to submit to this trial because 
He intended to give him glory, exalta- 
tion and honor; He intended to make 
him a king and a priest, to share with 
Himself the glory, power and dominion 
which He exercised. And was this 
trial any more than God Himself had 
passed through? God the Eternal Fa- 
ther gave His Only Begotten Son to 
die for us; and He wanted to see whe- 
ther Abraham was as willing to sacri- 
fice his son of promise as He Himself 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH P. SMITH. 



67 



was to sacrifice His well beloved, His 
first bom, Jesus Christ. And what of 
Isaac? Josephus tells us that Isaac 
was old enough to carry the wood for 
the sacrifice; and after his father had 
told him what the Lord wanted, Isaac, 
in the spirit of submission that such a 
. son had for such a father, said to him, 
"If the Lord bad not commanded you 
to do this, father, I would have been 
willing to have done whatever you re- 
quired of me." In this Isaac exhibited 
a spirit akin to that manifested by 
the Lord Jesus; and Abraham showed a 
willingness akin to that exhibited by 
the Father in offering up His Only Be- 
gotten Son for the rest of His brethren 
and sisters. 

Now, brethren and sisters, do you see 
why G-od requires these things at our 
hands? Can you comprehend why we 
are asked to love our neighbor as we do 
ourselves? Is there any sacrifice that 
we should not be willing to make? 
Think of the unselfishness of our Lord 
and Savior! He came and died for all 
of us. He loved His neighbor as He 
did himself. He loved the offspring of 
His Father as He did himself. We 
must be like Him, or we cannot sit 
down with Him in the kingdom of our 
Father. We must be willing to make 
every sacrifice necessary for the work 
of God. But in the first place we must 
get faith; for without faith it is impos- 
sible to please God and to make these 
sacrifices. Without faith our courage 
fails and we are filled with doubt; but 
with unflinching faith in God and in 
His willingness and power to save us, 
we can accomplish all the Lord requires 
at our hands. God bless you, in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

The aggregate of individual contributions to the 
Church accomplishes great good— Tithing a 
test of obedience— The Lord requires the 
willing mind. 

It is with a feeling of great depend- 
ence uopn the Spirit that I arise to 
speak. I feel extremely grateful for 
the outpouring of the good Spirit which 
has accompanied all the speaking that 
we have had throughout this Confer- 
ence; and I regret that all the congre- 
gation did not hear the most excellent 



discourse of President Franklin D. 
Richards this morning; I remarked to 
him when he sat down that I thought I 
never heard him speak better, but I 
was sure that half the congregation 
had not heard what he had said. It is 
a difficult thing to make so vast an as- 
sembly hear, and especially is this the 
case when there is a feeling of uneasi- 
ness among the people and more or less 
moving about. Brother C. J. Thomas 
can be seen here frequently with a 
company of people up in the other end 
of the gallery, and he will rub his coat 
sleeve and ask them at the other end 
if they can hear the sound, and they 
say yes. Then he will take a pin and 
drop it upon a table, and ask if they 
can hear that, and they say yes. It is 
the wonderful acoustic properties of 
this house that actually makes it so 
difficult, in one respect, to make the 
people hear when there are so many to- 
gether as are here today, because every 
little sound tends to confuse the voice 
of the speaker. 

I thank the Lord for the wonderful 
attendance on the part of the people 
during this Conference. It shows they 
are awake, and interested in the cause 
of Zion. I am sure that all the people 
who have heard the instructions which 
have been given must be well pleased 
and satisfied. 

I do not expect to advance a single 
thought in relation to the principle of 
tithing that has not already 
been covered, but I desire 
to call your attention to one thing 
which seems to me to be a prominent 
feature in tithepaying. It is not so 
much the means that we give into the 
storehouse of the Lord; for the Lord 
has plenty for Himself. The earth is 
His, and the fulness thereof. But it 
is a very important thing that we look 
at the necessities of the poor and con- 
sider the duty of carrying on the work 
of the Lord in all its branches. Every 
little that we contribute toward this 
end helps the cause just that little; 
and so the little that each does is of 
great importance to the cause of Zion. 
When all the people do a little, it ag- 
gregates a great deal, and there is 
abundance in the storehouse for the 
feeding of the poor, and for helping out 
in the proclamation of the Gospel to 
the nations of the earth. For many of 



68 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the Elders who are sent out to preach 
the Gospel have not means wherewith 
to provide for their families altogether, 
and the Church is called upon frequent- 
ly to assist. Then, the Church is called 
upon for means to pay for the return 
fare of almost every missionary from 
his field of labor. Sometimes an Elder 
dies abroad, and his remains have to 
be brought home, the family is not able 
to do it, so the Church has to bear the 
expense. When you take into consider- 
ation the hundreds of Elders that are 
out in the missionary field all the 
timie, and the fact that brethren are 
going and returning continuously, the 
expense connected with this matter 
amounts to a very large sum during the 
year. So that every little helps. Every- 
man's mite adds to the good cause. 

But there is a principle connected 
with tithepaying which, in my judg- 
ment, is above and beyond this, and 
that is the principle of obedience. I be- 
lieve the Lord designs in 
this principle to test the obed- 
ience of the people. When we 
come to stand before the bar of God, 
to be judged out of the things which 
are written in the books, we may find 
a difference between those things which 
are written in the books here and the 
things which are written in the ' books 
there. We can see this now. Who 
knows whether or not I pay my tithing? 
Do not the books show that I am a 
tithepayer? Certainly, they do; for all 
that I pay is credited to me on the tith- 
ing books of the Church. I think our 
system of bookkeeping in relation to 
the tithes of the people is so perfect 
that every man Who has ever paid 
tithing may go to the books and find 
there his credit. But the books here do 
not pretend to keep an account of the 
tithing you owe to God. We do not 
keep an account of that which you 
should pay; we simply keep an account 
of that which you do pay. But there 
is One above us who knows; and there 
may be a system of keeping accounts 
there wherein it will be known just 
what every man should pay to be hon- 
est with himself and the Lord. If that 
be so, when we come to be judged out 
of the things which are written in the 
books, the difference between that 
which we have paid and that which we 
should have paid will appear in the 



books, and they will show where we 
have been deficient in our duty. 

Now, if we are not faithful to this 
law, what evidence have we that we 
shall be faithful in other things? The 
Lord instituted it as a substitute, be- 
cause of our lack of faith, for the 
higher law of consecration, in which 
the Lord requires not only all that we 
have, but our hearts also; and by this 
substitute He designs to prove us, 
to see Whether we will be obedient or 
not. I perceive in this principle some- 
thing that is of greater worth to me 
than all the substance that I put into 
the storehouse of the Lord as tithing. 
That may be used wisely or. unwisely, 
so far as I know. What have I to do 
with that? It matters not to me what 
is done with it. It is my duty 
to obey the law that God has 
given. This is exemplified in the 
remarkable instance referred to 
by President Cannon — that of requiring 
Abraham to offer his son, Isaac. Did 
God ask him to do> this because he 
delighted in wringing the heart of His 
servant and causing him anguish? Noit 
at all. The Lord has no delight in that. 
But He wanted to put His servant to 
the test, to know whether he was will- 
ing to sacrifice himself or not in obed- 
ience to the requirement of heaven. 
That is what God wants in relation to 
this principle of tithing; He wants to 
know whether we will do our duty or 
not, and whether we will be honest or 
dishonest with Him. Every man is left 
to be his own judge as to what he calls 
his tithing, and there is a great var- 
iety of opinion as to what a tithing is. 
A man who works for wages, and de- 
votes his whole time to the service of 
his employer, and he receives $1,000 or 
$2,000 a year for his salary, it is an easy 
matter for him to tell how much he 
owes for tithing. If I earned $2,000 a 
year, I should know that my tithing 
was just one-tenth of that. And I would 
not take out what it had cost me to 
feed and clothe myself and to pay all 
the expenses necessary to the mainten- 
ance of my family, before I reckoned 
with the Lord as to what belonged to 
Him. Two hundred dollars would be 
my honest tithing, would it not? That 
is the way I look at it. Then, if a

bushels should he pay for tithing? 
Well, some people will go straightway 
to dickering with the Lord. They will 
say they hired a man so and so, and 
his wages must be taken out; that they 
had to pay such and such expenses, and 
this cost and that cost; and they reck- 
on out all their expenses, and tithe the 
balance. If a man earns $1,000, and 
it has cost him $600 to live, he pays 
tithing on the remaining $400. He con- 
siders that his net income, and he reck- 
ons with the Lord on that basis. Well, 
a great many of the Latter-day Saints 
reckon with God in just that way. 

Now, you are at liberty to do as you 
please in regard to this matter. You 
can choose which ever course you wish. 
But let me say to you that as we meas- 
ure out so will it be measured back unto 
us again. When we go to dickering 
with the Lord, probably He will dicker 
with us; and if He undertakes to do so, 
we shall get the worst of it. I think 
we had better be honest with the Lord, 
and deal justly and liberally with Him ; 
for. as it is said in the scriptures, the 
liberal man deviseth liberal things, and 
by his liberality shall he stand. My ex- 
perience in my childhood was that 
when the widow paid one-tenth of 
every bushel of potatoes, of wheat, of 
oats.of barley; when she paid the tenth 
chicken, or egg, the tenth calf, the 
tenth colt, the tenth pound of beef, 
or pork— when she did this she was 
blessed, and I know it. God opened up 
her way, and multiplied blessings upon 
her; and though a widow, driven into 
the wilderness with a large family, and 
without means to take care of them, 
she never had to ask for or receive 
help from the Church to feed and 
clothe her or her children. The Lord 
provided for her, because she put her 
trust in Him and she was obedient to 
His law. I am a witness to that. And 
the Lord will provide for other widows 
in the same way. He will provide for 
all His people according as they put 
their trust in Him and are faithful and 
obedient. "Obedience is better than 
sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat 
of rams." It is the heart and the wil- 
ling mind that the Lord requires of His 
people, and not so much their sub- 
stance. He does not need our obedi- 
ence. But we need to be obedient; for 



it is through obedience that we will re- 
ceive the reward. 

So I come to the conclusion that the 
principal thing about tithe paying is 
obedience to the law, and that more 
good will come to us through that obe- 
dience than to anybody else. We 
may be worth our tens of 
thousands, and pay an honest tithing 
on our income, making our tithing a 
large amount; yet the good that will 
come to ourselves by being obedient 
to the law of God will be far greater 
in the end than the good which our 
substance may do to the poor. He 
is more blessed who giveth alms than 
is he who receiveth them. The trou- 
ble is, when a man becomes rich he 
at once begins to feel too poor to be 
obedient to the laws of God. Riches 
make men poor when it comes to deal- 
ing with the Almighty. The poor man 
can easily pay his tithing and con- 
tribute of his little substance for the 
benefit of the needy; but if he becomes 
a millionaire, or anything like it, then 
his heart begins to narrow up. The 
result is, he deprives himself of the 
opportunity of receiving greater mani- 
festations of the kindness and mercy 
of God unto him, which he could re- 
ceive through the increased amount 
of good he could do with his enlarged 
means. Obedience is what the Almighty 
requires. It was obedience that He 
required of Abraham. I am speaking 
now of obedience to God, and not to 
man; and I am at the defiance of any 
man to prove that obedience to God, 
even in the paying of tithing, is not 
better than disobedience — better to the 
man himself, and better to the whole 
people. If a man is obedient to this 
law of tithing, he is entitled to the 
blessing of God himself and, so far 
as he is concerned, there are means in 
the storehouse of the Lord for the feed- 
ing of the poor, for the sending of the 
Gospel abroad, for the building of tem- 
ples, and for the accomplishment of His 
purposes; but if he is not obedient to 
this law, then there is nothing there, 
and he himself is deprived of the bless- 
ing that the Lord would otherwise give 
to him. I do not believe in obeying 
man, only when my judgment or the 
inspiration of the Almighty tells me 
that obedience to that man will be wise

nnrt eood In other words, I am not a in the promises of the Almighty and 
believer in blind obedience. I think those 
who know me can bear record to 
my testimony that I never yet obeyed 
any man, nor have I to my knowledge 
obeyed God, blindly. What I have done 
I have done with my eyes open. I have 
done it willingly, because I have be- 
lieved or have known it to be good. 
That is why I obey the counsels of the 
servants of God, and why I obey His 
law I know it is pleasing in the sight 
of the Lord for me to do this, and I re- 
ceive benefit thereby. 

Nowadays, if President Snow or 
somebody else gives counsel to some of 
our brethren, if it does not suit them 
exactly they will begin to whine about 
it, and shed great crocodile tears, per- 
haps. I have heard of men shedding 
tears because they had received coun- 
sel from their brethren! And what is 
more, the men that shed tears and 
mourn over having received a little 
counsel, are the kind that do not carry 
it out; or, if they do, they (tell why they 
did it— making somebody else responsi- 
ble for their acts. I say, out upon such 
obedience as that! I do not believe in 
that kind at all. 

I know that obedience to the Lord is 
a good thing. I know this also, that if 
Jesus Christ, the Son of God, had not 
been absolutely obedient to the re- 
quirements of His Father, He would 
have ceased to be the Savior of the 
w~orld, for He could not have accom- 
plished the mission He came to fulfill. 

If Abraham had not been obedient, even 

to the sacrificing of his own son, he 

would not be today the father of the 

faithful, and the promise made to him 

that his seed should have no end would 

havi: been revoked. The same with re- 
gard to Job, who was tried to the core. 

It was said, "put forth thy hand now 

and touch all that he hath, and he will 

curse thee to thy face." But the Lord 

knew he would not, and he said to 

Satan, "Behold, he is in thy hand; but 

save his life." Satan laid his hand up- 
on his property, upon his sons and his 

daughters, and upon his own body, 

and Job was brought down into the 

dust because of the afflictions that fell 

upon him; and yet he was true to 

God! It was his love of God, his faith 



his obedience to his Father that made 
him the example of the world. His 
name has come down and will go down 
to the end of time as an example to 
mankind of faith in God. When up- 
braided and told to curse God and die, 
Job turned and said, "Naked came I 
out of my mother's womb, and naked 
shall I return thither: the Lord gave, 
and the Lord hath taken away; blessed 
be the name of the Lord." Joseph 
the prophet was tried to the core, and 
he proved true unto death. So with 
others of his brethren; they were per- 
secuted, they were hounded, they were 
maligned, and every species of igno- 
miny heaped upon them, and finally 
they were put to death in cold blood; 
and yet they were true unto death. 
That is what God requires at our hands. 
He said, "I will try you even unto 
death, to see if you are worthy of the 
blessings I have in store for you." If 
you shrink from obedience to God, by 
which you become heirs of God and 
joint heirs with Jesus Christ — as Presi- 
dent Cannon said, "partners with Him 
in all that He possesses" — how can you 
expect to obtain eternal life and to 
become a partner with Him? If we are 
not true to these things, we are not 
worthy of them. May God bless us, 
therefore, and help us to be worthy of 
all that has been promised unto us 
through the keys and authority of the 
holy priesthood, that we may come up 
in the morning of the resurrection en- 
titled to all the blessings that have been 
sealed upon us. This is my prayer in 
the name of Jesus. Amen. 
The choir and congregation sang: 

Our God, we raise to Thee 
Thanks for Thy blessings free, 
We here enjoy; 
In this far distant land, 
A true and faithful band 
Led hither by Thy hand, 
Would sing for joy.

DESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION. 



Its Semi-Annual General Conference. 



The semi-annual conference of the 
Sunday schools of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints was held 
on Sunday evening-, April 9th, 1899, 
at 7 o'clock. 

There were present the general super- 
intendency, officers and members of the 
Deseret Sunday School Union Board 
and aids, a number of Apostles, presi- 
dents of Stakes and Bishops, and the 
Tabernacle was well filled with Sunday 
school workers. 

General Superintendent George Q. 
Cannon presided. 

The Tabernacle choir, under direc- 
tion of Prof, Evan Stephens, sang 
"Lord Thou wilt hear me when I pray." 
Prayer was offered by Elder John M. 
Mills. The choir sang "Come, dearest 
Lord." 

Secretary George D. Pyper called the 
roll which was responded to by repre- 
sentatives from twenty-seven Stakes. 
The secretary also read a portion of the 
general annual statistical report of the 
Sunday schools of the Latter-day Saints 
for 1898 showing: Total number of Sun- 
day schools, 1,019; male officers and 
teachers, 7,524; female officers and 
teachers, 5,524; total officers and teach- 
ers, 13,048; average attendance of offi- 
cers and teachers, 8,472; male pupils, 
50,862; females, 52,524; total number of 
pupils, 103,386; Sunday school mission- 
aries not enrolled, 269; total officers, 
teachers, pupils and missionaries, 116,- 
703; cash on hand and collected during 
the year, $17,264.33; disbursed, 13,278.12; 
on hand, $3,986.21. 

The report was approved and filed. 

General Superintendent George Q. 
Cannon said: 

"I feel very much gratified at this 
report, as I think you all do. "We have 
now, as you have heard, 103,000 pupils; 
this is a very fine showing; gone past 



the hundred thousand mark, and that 
has been gained during the last year." 

The secretary then presented the gen- 
ral Sunday school authorities, who 
were unanimously sustained as fol- 
lows:

reported that he had received from 
nickel donations for 1898, the sum of 
$3,111.62, an increase of nearly eight per 
cent over 1897.

Treasurer Reynolds also announced 
that the third edition of the small 
Sunday school hymn book was now 
ready, making in all 55,000 copies of this 
work which had been issued from the 
press. This edition contained a few 
new hymns and a greatly improved in- 
dex. Another edition of the Sunday 
school song book, in two styles of bind- 
ing, retailed respectively at 40 and 50 
cents was also ready. Numerous im- 
provements to make it more uniform 
with the Hymn book had been intro- 
duced in this edition. The proceedings 
of the late Sunday school convention 
held in this city were now on sale. 
Nearly 4,000 had been distributed gra- 
tuitously to the schools, and teachers 
and others desiring additional copies 
could purchase them at the office of the 
Union Board at 10 cents per copy. The 
second edition of the Treatise was also 
ready for those officers and teachers 
who did not possess a copy. Price 15 
cents. Some few years ago Dr. James 
E. Talmage delivered a series of lec- 
tures in the Assembly Hail in this 



city before the Theological class of the 
Church university on the "Articles of 
Faith." Under the direction of the 
First Presidency, these lectures had 
now been published in book form, af- 
ter having been examined by the 
Presidency and by a committee ap- 
pointed by them. This work is recom- 
mended to the Sunday schools and 
other Church organizations as a valu- 
able text book on questions relating to 
the faith of the Saints. 

The choir sang "Jesus, I my cross 
have taken." 

GENERAL SUPERINTENDENT 
GEORGE Q. CANNON 

Spoke feelingly on the death of 
First Assistant General Superintendent 
George Goddard, and paid a glowing 
tribute to the memory of this Sunday 
school veteran. 

Following are the remarks: 
I feel constrained to make a few re- 
marks at the opening of our meeting 
in relation to our late assistant super- 
intendent and warm friend, Elder 
George Goddard. I know you will all 
miss him, as we do who were his co-la- 
borers. His voice, his genial presence, 
his humorous manner of treating all 
questions, and the interest that he 
succeeded in throwing into everything 
connected with the Sunday School 
work, will be missed in all these meet- 
ings. We look around us and ask our- 
selves: Who can fill his place? He 
was unique, warm-hearted and 
thoroughly in earnest in all that he 
did for the Sunday school cause. It 
was dearer to him than his own com- 
fort or convenience. He did an amount 
of travel that I felt was too much for 
one of his years; but he was untiring 
in his labors and took delight in 
them, and he was sustained by the 
Lord, for the Lord bestowed blessings 
upon him and made him the means of 
doing an immense amount of good. 
It would be difficult to calculate upon 
the amount of good that our departed 
friend and brother has performed in 
this cause. He will be known and re- 
membered by the rising generation to 
an extent, probably, unequalled by any 
other man, because his manners were 
such as endeared him to all children. 
They felt he was their friend ; they ad-

mired and revered him, as well as the 
parents and all those associated with 
him. I am sure that you will feel with 
me that we have had what might be 
termed in one respect an irreparable 
loss. It is true that it is a saying 
among us that there is no man living 
but what can be spared; and the work 
goes on after his departure — even after 
the departure of the most prominent 
of men. But probably Elder Goddard 
filled a niche in our affections and work 
— our Sunday school work — that we 
shall find it very difficult to fill. But 
the Lord, of course, we know can raise 
up faithful laborers. Brother God- 
dard's example in his efforts and un- 
tiring zeal, will, I hope, be followed by 
all interested in this work, and I hope 
we will try with greater diligence to 
carry it forward and to do the work 
that he would do if he were here in 
our midst. 

I felt to say these few words and I 
know that in giving expression to these 
thoughts and feelings, though but 
feebly, I am also expressing the 
thoughts and feelings of your hearts. 
We all mourn his departure. Of course, 
his departure is for his gain, but it 
is a serious loss to us. 

I pray God that the spirit that he 
manifested in this work may rest down 
upon us all to an increased extent, that 
through our devotion and zeal we may, 
in some measure, make up for this loss. 
I ask this in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

APOSTLE HEBER J. GRANT. 

I have been requested to speak upon 
the late Sunday school convention held 
last November in the Assembly Hall. 

The convention was held on 
Monday and Tuesday and there were 
three sessions each day. It was re- 
markably well attended, there being 
but one Stake of Zion that failed to 
send delegates. I never attended a 
series of metings in my life where the 
people seemed to be so interested as in 
those held during the Sunday school 
convention. The spirit of the meetings 
was choice indeed. The people were 
particularly interested; their faces were 
lit up with interest, and we had a very 
enjoyable time, long to be remembered 
by each and every one present. Broth- 



er Reynolds has referred to the fact 
that the proceedings of the convention 
have been published in pamphlet form 
which contains over one hundred pages. 
The Sunday School Union has the 
pamphlet for sale, and it can also be 
found at the Juvenile Instructor office. 
Of course, you are all well aware of the 
fact that in reading the proceedings of 
a convention that you lose much of the 
inspiration manifested at the meetings; 
but, at the same time, each and every 
Sunday school worker and all those in- 
terested in the Sunday school work, will 
be greatly benefited by getting a copy 
of the proceedings of the convention 
and perusing it. Very many important 
items on Sunday school work are con- 
tained therein: How to hold Stake con- 
ferences, the proper manner of using 
the Leaflets, discourses on the Word of 
Wisdom, and many other matters of 
great interest to all connected with the 
Sabbath schools. I rejoice that we 
should have had such a grand and glor- 
ious convention with which to crown 
the public labor of our late Assistant 
Superintendent Brother George God- 
dard. He enjoyed those meetings ex- 
ceedingly. I wish to say in addition to 
the pleasure we had of listening to the 
instructions, that the music that was 
furnished us during those meetings was 
very pleasing indeed. A half hour was 
taken up at the commencement of each 
meeting in singing songs that are ren- 
dered in the Sabbath schools through- 
out the Church. 

I trust that we may again have the 
privilege of meeting in a convention. I 
feel, on account of the success of the 
one we did have, that we may be justi- 
fied in having another in the course of 
a year or so, and I am sure that it 
will be even more successful than the 
one we had last November. 

I thank God, my Heavenly Father, 
for the privilege of being associated 
with , the Sabbath school work, and I 
am also truly grateful for the increase 
of over 7,000 pupils since last year's re- 
port. It will only be a short time be- 
fore we will be able to add 10,000 to 
our Sunday schools every year. Truly 
Zion is growing. May God bless you and 
every one laboring for the Sabbath 
schools, is my prayer, and I ask it in 
the name of Jesus. Amen.

" DESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION. 



ELDER THOMAS C. GRIGGS 

This immense audience interested in 
Sunday school work, and the interest- 
ing, statistics that have been presented 
to us on the growth of this Sunday- 
school work are largely the result of 
an event that occurred nearly fifty 
years ago, viz: The establishment of 
the first Sunday school in these Rocky 
Mountains, which event transpired in 
the Fourteenth ward of this city, on 
the second Sunday in December, the 
9th day of the month, 1849, by Richard 
Ballantyne. It is proposed by the Des- 
eret Sunday School Union to celebrate 
that event. So far the proposition is 
to have a general celebration on Sun- 
day evening the Sth day of October, in 
this place. We trust that all the vete- 
ran Sunday school workers, those that 
have been connected with the Sunday 
school for 25, 30, 35, 40 and 45 years, 
will be present. In addition to this 
it is proposed that local celebrations 
be held in each Sunday school on the 
second Sunday in December, this year, 
the 10th day of the month. A suggest- 
ive program for the celebration will be 
published hereafter. Besides this is 
our record work. Blanks have been 
sent to every Sunday school for a syn- 
opsis of their respective histories and 
the names of those that have presided 
in the various schools. For this pur- 
pose three blanks have been sent to 
each Sunday school to be filled out; 
one of these is to be retained by the 
school, one to be sent to the Stake su- 
perintendency and one to be sent to 
the general secretary, Brother George 
D. Pyper. Another matter pertaining to 
this is the appointment of a special 
committee, by each Stake superintend- 
ency, to act in conjunction with the 
general committee on the Semi-centen- 
nial celebration. The name and ad- 
dress of the chairman of this special 
committee should be sent to the gen- 
eral secretary that communication may 
be had with him. This labor of pre- 
paring these individual histories is one 
that will require patience and persever- 
ance to accomplish. This work is im- 
mediately before us, as superintend- 
ents of schools and Stake superintend- 
ents. We trust this matter will be 
given immediate attention, as it is in- 
tended that these reports shall be 



bound into one volume. We have now, 
as our statistics show, over 1,000 Sun- 
day schools. The preparation of this 
history will afford the basis for the 
celebration of the centennial anniver- 
sary; also for the millennial anniver- 
sary, which we expect to see in its 
time. 

Elder George D. Pyper sang, "Hosan- 

na." 

APOSTLE GEORGE TEASDALE. 

From the Doctrine and Covenants, 
section 68, page 250, beginning with the 
25th verse, we have the following in- 
struction: 

"And again, inasmuch as parents 
have children in Zion, or in any of her 
Stakes which are organized, that teach 
them not to understand the doctrine of 
repentance, faith in Christ the Son of 
the living God, and of baptism and the 
gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on 
of the hands when eight years old, the 
sin be upon the heads of the parents; 

"For this shall be a law unto the in- 
habitants of Zion, or in any of her 
Stakes which are organized; 

"And their children shall be baptized 
for the remission of their sins when 
eight years old, and receive the laying 
on of the hands; 

"And they shall also teach their chil- 
dren to pray and to walk uprightly be- 
fore the Lord." 

It is very much to be regretted that 
children should frequently be in the 
Sabbath school after they are eight 
years of age without being baptized. 

Now, children have rights as well as 
the rest of humanity. The Lord has 
given instruction unless the par- 
ents prepare them for this baptism that 
the parents will be under condemnation. 
In Sunday schools where they are very 
strict they will not allow unbaptized 
children over eight years old to partake 
of the Sacrament. It would be in har- 
mony with the commandments of the 
Lord to have the parents taught this 
duty towards their children at their 
firesides by our Teachers — not the 
teachers of the Sabbath school, but the 
regular ward Teachers. Every child 
who desires it has a right to be bap- 
tized when eight years of age. It is 
singular to me that fathers do not take 
sufficient interest in their children to 
get permission of the Bishop to have

their children baptized on their eighth 
birthday. Many children have looked 
forward to this event with a great deal 
of anxiety, and then when the time 
came they were pushed aside with the 
remark, "O, well, there are no baptisms 
today, and you can be baptized on some 
other occasion." The Lord says His 
house is a house of order. So it is per- 
fectly natural and perfectly consistent 
that the Lord should require at the 
hands of the parents that the children 
should be prepared for baptism by the 
time they are eight years of age. Some- 
body can always be found who holds 
the Priesthood of Aaron or of Mel- 
chisedek, who will very willingly put 
himself out a little to baptize 
the children, that they may have that 
blessed privilege. I know of an in- 
stance where a child was very anxious 
for baptism, but it was put off and put 
off and by and by the child died with- 
out being baptized. "Well, I argue that 
these dear children should have this 
privilege. You know we love your chil- 
dren; you know we devote a great deal 
of time to them. I would advise you, 
my fellow laborers in the Sunday 
school, to make this one of your items 
and see that your children are baptized 
when the proper time arrives. As you 
are their friends and instructors, put 
yourselves out a little to see that this 
is done, that those dear children may 
have the privilege of being baptized; 
that they may be enabled to give the 
reasons why they are baptized, and of 
the conditions of baptism. When teach- 
ing a Sabbath school class in Nephi 
— mine was the primary class — wo used 
to sing them the song, "Jesus, Mighty 
King in Zion," and explain it to them 
as we went along. 

And we explained the different modes 
of baptism so that they might under- 
stand that there are a class of people 
who baptize by pouring, and another 
class who baptize by sprinkling; one 
saying for justification the Lord would 
pour out an oblation, and the other 
saying that He would sprinkle many 
nations. Let us instruct our children, 
that we may assist the parent in pre- 
paring them for this baptism. I consid- 
er that this is a part of our duty. Let 
us respect the children, and let us see 
that they have their rights. I 
remember a child of mine whom I 



baptized here in the font in Salt Lake 
City. I had him up on a visit from 
Nephi. With Elder Charles J. Thomas, 
who kindly assisted me, I baptized 
him when he was eight years 
of age and confirmed him, and then I 
took him to have his likeness taken, 
that he might never forget it. That 
was the interest I took in him. In 
Mexico, when I baptized a little maid 
of my own on her eighth birthday, I 
gave it. out that I would baptize her 
on that day, and if there were any 
children who had been neglected we 
would attend to them at the same time. 
We baptized her and several others. I 
have been particular with my children 
that this should be done on their na- 
tal day. I think of times we are very 
careless in our records; it is occasional- 
ly difficult to find out when people have 
been baptized. If you will baptize a 
child the day it is eight years of age 
the date will always be remembered. 
It seems to me that a father would de- 
light to do this, and keep his own rec- 
ord and act as the patriarch in his own 
house. All you have to do is to get 
the consent of your Bishop and have 
a proper record made of it. 

My beloved fellow laborers. God bless 
you. Let us always remember that 
the children have the right to be bap- 
tized when eight years of age. I am 
grateful for having the privilege of 
being a Sabbath school laborer. I have 
been so for a number of years, and I 
delight to be associated with our Sun- 
day school children. I pray God, our 
eternal Father, that His blessings may 
rest upon every Sabbath school laborer, 
that we may be able to set a good 
example and teach the children to their 
understanding, through Jesus Christ. 
Amen. 

APOSTLE FRANCIS M. LYMAN. 

In answer to the question of Brother 
Bickley, from Beaver, whether chil- 
dren should be allowed to partake of 
the Sacrament after they are eight 
years of age and are not baptized: Of 
course, the law should be observed, and, 
in order that this question need not be 
asked in regard to the children of the 
Latter-day Saints, we would advise 
that the Bishops, who h.ave the bap- 
tisms under their care, see to it that

arrangements are made in every ward 
that the children may be baptized when 
they are eight years of age. We have 
been lenient in this regard— that is, the 
rule of the Church has been— and the 
children have been allowed to partake 
of the Sacrament after they were eight 
years of age in order that they might not 
feel injured and their hearts hurt. But, 
the Bishops should make the arrange- 
ments in their respective wards that on 
any day in the year, cold or warm, the 
children may be baptized when eight 
years of age. It is a splendid thing to 
do; it is a nice arrangement and ought 
to be observed in all the Church. But 
until this is done — when children are 
anxious and want to be baptized and it 
is not their fault that they have not 
been — we ought not to be too stringent 
in refusing the Sacrament to the chil- 
dren of the Latter-day Saints. They 
would like to be baptized and they 
ougii^ to be. If they are not baptized 
at the proper time, the sin be upon the 
head of the Bishop. 



SECOND ASSISTANT SUPERINTEN- 
DENT KARL G. MAESER. 

The subject given me to speak upon 
for a few minutes is "Humane Day." 
It has been customary for the Sunday 
School Union to have a day set apart 
during the year on which the Sunday 
school teacher should pay particular 
attention to kindness to animals. This 
day has usually been the last Sunday 
in February, but the Sunday School 
Union Board, perhaps, may fix some 
other day, if so, it will be made public. 
Kindness to animals has also been 
enjoined upon us by Holy Writ, for 
"A righteous man is merciful to his 
animals." Now, there is too much 
neglect on this point observable among 
our people. A letter was received by 
the Sunday School Union Board, some 
time ago, from a sister up north, re- 
questing that the brethren take this 
into consideration and enjoin upon the 
Sunday school workers the duty of 
impressing upon the minds of the pu- 
pils the necessity of being kind to ani- 
mals and abstaining from any kind of 
cruelty. She also alluded to the bad 
example being set by some in the win- 



ter of leaving their animals out in the 
storm, snow and cold, without any 
covering or without any regard to their 
suffering. These dumb beasts were 
neglected during the stormy weather 
and received bad treatment at the 
hands of their masters. That brings 
to my mind an instance of several 
years ago, when Heber C. Kimball was 
with us. He was going down State 
street with some of the brethren and 
they saw a man abusing a horse most 
unmercifully. As intelligent and well 
posted as these brethren were with re- 
gard to handling animals, they could 
not find out what was really wanted 
of the animal. The man was beating 
it unmercifully. Brother Kimball 
turned to these brethren and said, 
"brethren, that horse will demand jus- 
tice of that man some time and will 
get it. He is making himself a 
debtor to that animal." There is a 
sound, glorious principle connected 
with this. Could I as an intelligent 
being, place myself in such a position 
that I would become a debtor to an 
animal, and place myself under such 
a condition that that animal could 
claim justice from me on account of 
ill-treatment? We may have to slay 
animals for food and other legitimate 
reasons, when it is absolutely neces- 
sary; but when it is done it should be 
done with as little pain to the animal 
as possible. Let us be merciful, as the 
Scriptures say "A righteous man is 
merciful to animals." This is a 
principle we should make a point of 
in all our Sunday schools. We should 
enjoin it upon the pupils, not simply 
one single day in the year, which is set 
apart for this. I would rather see it 
urged whenever occasion requires, 
whenever any one in the Sunday school 
has been cruel to animals in any way. 
I know it is displeasing in the sight 
of the Lord. This should be taught 
to the children in the Sabbath schools, 
that the children of the Latter-day 
Saints may be known for their kind- 
ness to animals. 

I suppose the Sunday School Union 
Board will take this matter into con- 
sideration some day and make known 
the day that will be most convenient 
and proper to be set apart for that 
purpose.

TREE PLANTING AND FORESTRY 
BY ELDER SEYMOUR B. YOUNG. 

"The groves were God's first tem- 
ples." In one of these tempies Joseph 
Smith sought the Lord in prayer and 
received a visit from the Father and 
the Son, and a high commission from 
them, which called him to his prophetic 
ministry— the Prophet, Seer and Re vela- 
tor of the dispensation of the fulness 
of times. Shady groves have always 
been considered as a fit and sacred 
place of holding communion with the 
Creator of the universe, as well as for 
other noble purposes. Instance: The 
old elm tree that stands in the town of 
Cambridge today, said to be more than 
300 years old. Beneath this tree Wash- 
ington received the command of the 
Continental Army, in 1775. The sub- 
ject of planting trees cannot be too 
deeply impressed upon our young peo- 
ple, and at the approach of every Ar- 
bor Day, all the Sunday school children 
should be encouraged to assist in plant- 
ing one or more trees around their 
homes, in gardens or fields and other 
proper places designated by their teach- 
ers and their parents. Cultivation of 
forests and of the better class of timber 
has always been a profitable labor and 
investment to those who enter upon 
this branch of farming, with a proper 
understanding, and with perserverance 
and industry continued their efforts. 
Some places in Europe, especially in 
Germany, the small forests are made to 
yield a large income, supporting very 
many families by the yield of wood and 
lumber and the gums that exude from 
spruce and balsams. Nut-bearing trees 
are of much importance to the farmers 
of this country and could be made a 
source of great profit to all those who 
would plant a few of these species of 
forest trees, among the best and most 
i . ofitable of which is the black wainut. 
Large farms can be bordered with these 
trees, and as they grow for ten or 
twelve years, the nuts produced by 
them will aid very materially in paying 
the expenses of the farm and its culti- 
vation. When they become too large 
and crowd each other in the rows, good 
sale can be made of them to cabinet 
makers and furniture producers. 

Speaking of trees, I am reminded of a 
very beautiful story: A traveler return- 



ing to his native home after years of 
absence, saw a man in the act of cut- 
ting down a large oak tree, under whose 
pleasant shade he had played when a 
boy. He paid the man quite a sum of 
money to allow the tree to remain 
standing, and he wrote the following 
beautiful lines on the subject: 

"Woodman, spare the tree; 

Cut not one single bough; 
In youth it sheltered me, 

And I'll protect it now. 
'Twas my forefather's hand 

That placed it near his cot, 
There woodman let it stand; 

Thy ax shall harm it not." 

GEN. SUPT. GEORGE Q. CANNON. 

Made the closing address as follows: 

There are only a few minutes left, 
and I do not wish to occupy but those 
few minutes. 

There are some questions that have 
been submitted to us, that is, to the 
Sunday School Union Board, which it 
is thought proper to answer. 

One is, Who shall preside in the Sun- 
day school when all the superintenden- 
cy are absent? 

There should be no question about 
this: if they are all going to be absent 
they should arrange for somebody to 
take charge in their absence, either the 
teacher who has charge of the Theolo- 
gical class or some other suitable teach- 
er, that the school may not be left with- 
out a proper person to take charge. 

As to the appointment of Sunday 
school missionaries, superintendents 
and officers, all this should be done by 
consent of the Bishop or with his ap- 
proval. The question has been asked: 
Shall the superintendent appoint such 
officers or shall the Bishop appoint? 
There should be no conflict with regard 
to this. There should be perfect har- 
mony between the president of the 
Stake and the superintendent of the 
Sunday schools — the Stake superin- 
tendant — and both should work to- 
gether. Of course, it is understood, how- 
ever, that a superintendent of a Stake 
has no right to act without the Bishop. 
The Bishop presides in his ward; the 
president of the Stake presides in his 
Stake, and all officers under either of 
these organizations are subject to them.

Therefore, a superintendent should con- 
sult with the Bishop or with the presi- 
dent of the Stake; however, a Bishop or 
Stake president will not appoint with- 
out consulting with the superintendent. 
He will pay respect to the officer that 
has charge of the Sunday school and 
will not act, if he is a prudent, wise 
Bishop, without consulting with that 
officer. 

There are other topics to speak upon, 
but I cannot take time to dwell upon 
them. There is one subject, I think, 
however, that should be taught in our 
Sunday schools more than it is, and 
that is courtesy. There is a rudeness 
about our children that ought to be cor- 
rected. There is not respect paid by 
boys to girls, by young men to women, 
and there is manifest in our streets 
very frequently a want of respect to the 
weaker sex and to aged people, upon 
which, I think, very profitable lessons 
may be given to our children. Tou will 
notice it during muddy weather. I have 
seen it many times — a person driving a 
team and a lady crossing the street — 
our streets have been seas of mud at 
times — he drives along and splashes 
mud over a lady on the street and then 
laughs at it, as though he had done 
something smart. Now you will see 
much discourtesy and rudeness of this 
kind. We see it constantly; and yet, 
the boys and men that are guilty of this 
are not so inclined naturally, but it is 
for want of proper training, and they 



ought to be trained. We can train 
them in the Sunday school. This rude- 
ness will be seen there and at other 
gatherings. It can be seen at times 
when children are going out of a car 
or going out of a door, the strong boys 
will push forward and crowd the girls 
and little ones that are weaker than 
they are, and rush out regardless of 
the comfort or, indeed, of the safety 
of the smaller children and girls. 

Brethren and sisters, it is a good 
place in our Sunday schools to teach 
lessons of politeness and kindness— to 
teach our boys to be kind and gentle- 
manly and to teach our girls to be lady- 
like. Let us try and raise up a genera- 
tion of gentlemen and ladies. A man 
raised as a Latter-day Saint is natur- 
ally, if he lives his religion, a gentle- 
man, and the girl or woman raised as a 
Latter-day Saints is naturally a lady, 
but they do not know how. sometimes, 
to behave themselves, and they ought 
to be taught. This rudeness in crossing 
the streets and splashing mud, no doubt 
many of you have noticed. 

I pray God to bless us and to help us 
to remember the instructions we have 
received this evening, which I ask in 
the name of the Lord. Amen. 

The choir sang, "Glory to God in the 
Highest." 

Adjourned. 

Benediction. 

GEO. D. PTPER. Secretary.

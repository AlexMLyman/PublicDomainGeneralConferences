PRESIDENT WILFORD WOOD- 
RUFF. 

OPENING REMARKS . 

I feel very thankful to have the 
privilege of meeting with so many of 
the Latter-day Saints in this, our 
Sixty-eighth Annual Conference of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints. I had my fears that I would 
not be able to attend this Conference 
at all, as I have been quite unwell the 
last month; but the last day or two 
I have been blessed with better health. 
It is a great satisfaction to me to have 
this privilege. I am satisfied myself 
that there are many thousands in the 
spirit world, including the Prophet 
Joseph Smith and other leaders of this 
Church, who are quite as deeply inter- 
ested in this Conference and our work 
today as we possibly can be ourselves. 
I hope, while we are together, that we 
may enjoy the Spirit of God; that our 
minds may be opened, and our teach- 
ings and instructions be led in that 
channel which shall be unto the edifi- 
cation of the Saints and beneficial to 
us. 

The signs of the times show that 
the Lord has not forgotten His prom- 
ises, made through the inspiration of 
Prophets and Apostles in generations 
that are past and gone. There ha:5 
been a great change in the world with 
regard to "Mormonism" the last year 
of our lives, as shown in the increase 
of the work and qf the labors of the 
Elders of Israel among all the nation"-; 
where they have been called to travel. 
I hope and pray that^ve may be in a 



2 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



condition to comprehend our duties to- 
day and what is lying before us, that 
the purposes of God concerning us as 
Latter-day Saints may be carried out. 
I trust that the Spirit of God may be 
with not only those who speak and 
teach during this Conference, but with 
those also who sit and hear. My 
prayer to God is that His blessing may 
be over us, that our minds may be 
open to comprehend our duties, our 
blessings, and those things which are 
required at our hands; that we may 
be true and faithful in our labors 
while we dwell in the flesh, so that 
when we get through we may be satis- 
fied with our labors here, and be 
justified when we are called to give 
an account of the deeds done in the 
body. I say, God bless you. I pray 
for His Holy Spirit to rest upon us 
as the Saints of God, and upon those 
who may address us; which is my de- 
sire in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

PRESIDENT GEORGE Q. CANNON. 

Dawning of a brighter day— Predictions in relation 
to the work of God— Guided by the Spirit of 
prophecy — Trials and deliverances, past, present 
and prospective— the missionary department- 
Advisability of using women as missionaries. 

It is gratifying this morning to see 
so large an assemblage in this building, 
at the commencement of our Confer- 
ence, and it is to be hoped that the in- 
terest that is manifested today by those 
who are present will be maintained dur- 
ing the Conference, that through that 
interest we may obtain a goodly decree 
of the Spirit of God, and may all feel, 
when this Conference closes, that it has 
been the best Conference we ever at- 
tended. This is is the usual feeling 
which those who attend the Confer- 
ences experience. At each Conference 
the blessings of God that are re- 
ceived appear to be greater than 
ever before, and of course this 
feeling is produced by the in- 
terest that each one has in attending 
the meetings and in listening to the in- 
structions and drinking into the spirit 
of the Conference. It is most gratify- 
ing to all of us to see President Wood- 
ruff and to hear his voice. As he 
has said, he scarcely expected a few 
days ago to be able to attend this Con- 
ference, suffering as he did from a very 



severe attack of cold. But he is here 
with us, and it is a cause of great satis- 
faction and pleasure to all to see him 
and to hear his voice, even if it is only 
for a brief period. 

As President Woodruff has said, the 
progress of the work is very gratifying. 
It is an important period in which we 
are living. A great change has taken 
place in relation to this work and its 
bearing upon the nations. No doubt 
the greater portion of this congregation 
will remember the promises that were 
made by the servant of God during the 
dedication of the Salt Lake Temple five 
years ago. Predictions were made then 
that seemed unlikely to be fulfilled, 
looking at affairs as men naturally look 
at them. But not a word was said 
concerning the progress of this work 
and the favor that it would find from 
that time forward that has not been 
literally fulfilled. 

As I have said, a great change has 
taken place in relation to the work of 
the Lord. It occupies a different posi- 
tion, in many, respects, to that which 
it has ever occupied before. It was a 
cause of consolation to the Saints, in 
the dark hours that we witnessed some 
ten or twelve years ago, to hear the El- 
ders predict that a better day was 
about to dawn upon the people, and 
that we should emerge from the trials 
and difficulties and sorrows of those 
days with greater influence and more 
power, more respected as a people than 
we ever had been. It seemed highly im- 
probable that those predictions would 
be fulfilled, because the bitterness en- 
tertained toward the Latter-day Saints 
and their religion was so widespread 
and deep-seated. But those predictions 
have been fulfilled. 

We have often been surrounded by 
very difficult circumstances, and there 
have been many times in our history 
when it seemed as though this work of 
God would be overthrown and all his 
purposes brought to naught. Those who 
have fought against this work have in- 
dulged in those anticipations. \The 
measures which they undertook, and 
which they endeavored to carry out, 
had for their object the destruction of 
this organization and the breaking up 
of this people. They supposed these 
measures sufficient to accomplish the 
ends they had in view. If they had 
not felt sure of this, they would, with- 



PRESIDENT GEORGE Q. CANNON.

out doubt, have tried other plans. 

That which has sustained the Lat- 
ter-day Saints during their times of 
trial has been the spirit of prophecy. 
The Lord has given to His Elders the 
spirit of prophecy. In the midst of the 
most terrible trials, when the people 
were broken up, driven out from their 
homes and possessions, in a state of 
utter destitution, without food, without 
proper clothing-, without shelter, home- 
less wanderers, scattered by the ruth- 
less hand of violence — in those dark 
hours the Lord gave unto His servants 
the spirit of prophecy. It rested upon 
them in power, and they predicted to 
the people that a better day would 
dawn upon them, and they would 
emerge from their trials stronger and 
better, more firmly rooted in the faith 
which the Lord had revealed to them, 
than they were before, more than 
once in the history of the Latter-day 
Saints have mobs driven them from 
their homes — the places the Lord had 
designated as places of gathering; and 
they were a scattered people, brok- 
en up, and without an abiding place. 
But under the inspiraton of the Al- 
mighty, through the spirit of prophecy 
that He gave to His servants, and to 
the people themselves, they were 
drawn together and held by bonds that 
were invisible to human eyes. And 
though at times they were widely sep- 
arated, they were drawn together to 
the new gathering place, which under 
the inspiration of the Almighty through 
His servants, and in which they them- 
selves also shared, they knew to be the 
place for them once more to assemble. 
How numerous soever the temptatona 
all around them to induce them to 
desert the cause of God, to leave a peo- 
ple who were so persecuted and who 
had to endure such trials, these in- 
visible bonds of which I speak drew 
them together and prompted them to 
again attempt to build up cities and 
temples, where they could worship the 
Almighty according to the command- 
ments which He had given unto them. 

It is truly marvelous to look back 
upon the history of the Latter-day 
Saints; to see the power that had been 
manifested in holding them together 
as they have been. As I have said, 
those who framed plans against them, 
supposed they could not fail in des- 
troying the organization of the Church 



and separating the people in such a 
way that they would never again be 
united. But the people did gather to- 
gether again. It was the power of God 
that did this. It was the spirit of pro- 
phecy that rested upon the servants of 
God, which encouraged the people, 
which told them that the Lord had re- 
vealed and established His Church on 
the earth, and that there was neither 
power on earth nor in hell that could 
destroy it, or that could thwart His 
purposes, as predicted by the mouths 
of His holy prophets. As in the past, 
so it has been of late years. That 
same spirit has rested upon the people. 
And there is this grand peculiarity con- 
nected wth this work; it has not been 
those men alone who have been chosen 
by the Lord to lead who have had this 
spirit.They have not prophesied without 
a witness on the part of the faithful 
people themselves that that which they 
said was the truth and from the Al- 
mighty. For in the hearts of all the 
Latter-day Saints there has been a 
responsive echo to the words of hope, 
cheer and comfort and prophesy that 
have been given by those upon whom 
the spirit of prophecy has rested. The 
people have felt the spirit, thev have 
been cheered and sustained by it. We 
have seen this so often that we know 
that that which the Lord has spoken 
concerning His work will be fulfilled. 

It is astonishing, when we reflect 
upon it, what has been done in this 
respect. We have seen people driven 
out from their homes in utter desti- 
tution, crossing the plains, with im- 
provised wagons, made in the rudest 
manner, out of the greenest material, 
with cows, or oxen, or ponies, or any- 
thing that could be hitched up 
to draw them; a few personal 
effects thrown into the wagon, 
with a small amount of food, 
many of the men, and the women, too, 
almost barefooted, and the children in 
the same condition— all inspired by one 
spirit, and that the Spirit of God. There 
was nothing in their circumstances, 
that could be seen by the natural eye 
to cheer or to sustain them. But they 
were full of hope, buoyant in their feel- 
ings, traveling with as much confidence 
and certainly as though they knew 
every step they had to take and that 
there was a good place ahead of them 
which they would reach and in the 



4 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



"pleasures of which they could partake. 
We have seen this, I say, and it has 
been an astonishing- illustration of 
what God can do for a people; of how 
He can sustain them, and inspire them 
to do the work that He requires at their 
liands. 

When the Saints were in Iowa (then 
a territory), traveling through, and af- 
terwards at Winter Quarters, the wo- 
men, in many instances, took their 
feather beds, and sent them down to 
Missouri to sell, in order to get a little 
provision. All sorts of expedients were 
resorted to in order to get a little food. 
There was Missouri on the left, inviting 
the people— a good land, food in plenty, 
a land where they could live with com- 
parative ease. But did the Saints 
swerve? Did they, during the dreadful 
days of Winter Quarters, think they 
must desert that place where so many 
died through exposure and the want 
of suitable food, and gO' where they 
could get some of the comforts and con- 
veniences of life? Were such thoughts 
in the hearts of the people? No; no 
such feeling was manifested. If any de- 
serted then, they were so few as not to 
be remembered. The people had a mis- 
sion. Each man, woman and child 
(that was old enough) felt that God had 
entrusted to him and to her a mission; 
and with unswerving integrity, with 
unfaltering cpurage, they maintained 
their foothold there until the time when 
they could start further west. 

It was that same spirit and intensity 
of devotion that inspired them in com- 
ing to this land. And what was it 
that kept the people here? What 
influence was there operating upon 
them? Was there anything inviting 
in this land? To look at it now, and 
to imagine that this was its condition 
when the brethren and sisters came 
here in the first place, you would say, 
"this is an inviting country, a de- 
lightful place to stop." But no such 
sight as we now witness was beheld 
by them. Everything was forbidding. 
It looked as though the people might 
starve to death; and after the 
■crickets came it certainly looked for 
a while as though they would 
starve to death. Did the Latter-day 
Saints falter then? No, they did not. 
What was it that sustained them? It 
was this same spirit of prophecy that I 
have alluded to — the Spirit of God, which 



is the Spirit of prophecy. the 
Elders testified that this was the place 
which God had chosen, and which He 
had appointed as a place of gathering 
for His Saints; and they themselves 
had the same testimony, the same 
spirit. A peculiar love sprung up in 
the hearts of the people for this land, 
even in those days. There was some- 
thing most attracive about its moun- 
tains and valleys and these clear 
streams of water that flowed from the 
mountains. One thing that added to 
its charm was, it was a land of liberty, 
a land of freedom, a land where mobs 
could not come and attack us, as they 
had done in the past; a place where 
the families of the Saints, and the lead- 
ing men among them, could go to bed 
in peace and quietness, undisturbed by 
the fear that they would be attacked 
during the night. This brought a 
strange and delightful feeling of relief. 
If they only had bread to eat, or suffi- 
cient to sustain life; if they had only 
water to drink, I believe that the great 
bulk of the people — with scarcely an 
exception, I may say — would have been 
content to remain here even under those 
circumstances.The idea of having fruit 
such as we now have, and in 
such abundance, was scarcely an- 
ticipated. If anticipated at all, 
it was by but very few, be- 
cause the seeds that were sown 
and the little trees that grew up were 
frozen down the first two or three 
years. But there was a contented and 
a happy people here. They went to 
bed with their doors unlocked. There 
was no fear among them. They had 
been relieved from a terrible fear. 
Those who came under those circum- 
stances could recall the nights and the 
hours they had spent watching and 
fearing for a mob to come upon them 
to drive them out of their homes, to 
burn their houses, perhaps to inflict 
upon them personal violence. They re- 
membered, too, that not one of their 
leading men could go to sleep in his 
house without having a guard to watch 
him. The relief from that condition of 
affairs was such as to bring happiness 
in and of itself. But I say again, it 
was the spirit of Prophecy that rested 
upon the Elders and upon the neoDle 
that sustained them. God revealed by 
His Holy Spirit the future that awaited 
the people. The people knew, as they

knew that they lived, that this work 
was bound to triumph, that it was 
bound to be successful, that those who 
clung to it would be successful with it, 
and that there was a great and glorious 
triumph awaiting them, not only in 
this life, but in the realms of bliss in 
the life to come. 

It has been that same spirit that has 
rested down of late years upon the 
people. They have been comforted and 
sustained by the Spirit of God and the 
predictions of the servants of God. It 
is a wonderful blessing, my brethren 
and sisters. It is well for us to think 
of it today as the members of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints; think that we are in this happy 
condition; that the heavens are in com- 
munication with us, because it is from 
heaven that we receive these blessings 
that are so delightful and that have 
such an effect upon us and upon our 
movements. It is a blessed thing to 
think that the heavens are with us in 
this; that we are guided by the revela- 
tions of the Lord Jesus; that the gift 
of prophecy has been restored in our 
day, and has been received and enjoyed 
by men. Not a prediction has been 
uttered concerning this work, so far as 
the work itself is concerned, that has 
not been fulfilled. Not a hope has been 
inspired, not an encouragement has 
been given to the Latter-day Saints 
by the prophets of God, that has not 
up to the present hour been abundantly 
fulfilled, as far as we have gone. Much 
yet remains to be fulfilled. It would 
be impossible for the human mmd to 
conceive of that which remains; but 
we see the fufillment of the predictions 
as we progress day by day. They are 
fulfilled in our sight, when our eyes are 
open bo perceive them. Therefore, our 
hearts ought to be filled with gladness 
and exceeding thanksgiving to 'the 
Lord our God that we are in this con- 
dition; that the Lord has not forgotten 
us; that He has not closed His ears 
against us, nor His mouth, so that He 
cannot speak to us; that He has not 
turned His face away from us; but that 
He smiles upon us, that He gives unto 
us the comforting, cheering and en- 
lightening influences of His Holy 
Spirit to be with us. 

Now we are passing through other 
trials. "We have emerged from those 
that environed us a few years ago. A 



great change, as I have said, has taken 
place in public feeling concerning us. 
Our Elders are treated generally with 
a great deal of kindness. Of the thou- 
sand Elders that are now laboring in 
the United States, the report comes 
from most of them that they are treat- 
ed with kindness. Traveling without 
purse and scrip, they are entertained, 
friends are raised up to them, doors are 
opened to them, and they are treated 
kindly, and not persecuted to anything 
like the extent they were a few years 
ago. The same report comes from the 
five hundred Elders who are 
now engaged in the ministry 
in Europe. Their testimony agrees 
with the testimony of the servants 
of God in the United States. This is 
particularly the case in the German 
empire. There was a time when it was 
almost at the cost of personal liberty 
that men preached the Gospel there. 
They had to do so in secrecy, in places 
where the police could not punish them 
because of the nature of their gather- 
ings. But now this is changed. Re- 
ligious freedom has dawned in many of 
these countries, and the Elders now 
can preach without being put in jeop- 
ardy as they were a few years ago. 

On the islands of the Pacific there are 
some two hundred Elders laboring, and 
their labors are also attended with 
good results. They speak of the mani- 
festation of the power and blessings 
of God in their behalf, and of the kind- 
ly feeling that is manifested towards 
them by those with whom they are 
brought in contact. 

Thus these seventeen hundred Elders 
are laboring now with an efficiency and 
with a success that is unparalled in 
the history of our Church. At no time 
has this Church held an annual Con- 
ference where there was greater cause 
for gratulation and thanksgiving than 
there is today in this Sixty-eighth An- 
nual Conference of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints. Never 
before were there so many 
Elders in the field. Never 
before did they meet with such suc- 
cess. Never before were there so many 
baptized in a single year apparently 
as there have been during this year. 
These causes of thanksgiving ought to 
be remembered by us, and we ought to 
thank our God from the bottom of our 
hearts for that which He is doing for 



6 



GENERAL CONFEREALE. 



us, for the fulfillment of the words of 
the servant of God in the Temple when 
it was dedicated; for he then proph- 
esied what would be the result of that 
dedication and the glorious effects that 
would follow that work. 

In our own country here we also 
have cause for thanksgiving. It is 
interesting to the Saints, no doubt, to 
know, as many probably do know, 
that Brothers Lyman and Cowley 
have visited the conferences and the 
Elders in the Southern, Eastern and 
Northern States, and their ministra- 
tions among those whom they have 
visited have been attended with good 
effects, in regulating affairs, giving 
instructions, correcting anything that 
was improper or that was likely to 
become improper. We have been 
greatly gratified at hearing the reports 
which they have given to us of the 
results of their labors. The Presidents 
and Elders in the Southern, Eastern, 
Northern and Southwestern States 
missions are doing excellent work. 

As you know probably, Brother 
Anthon H. Lund has left here since 
our last Conference for Palestine, ac- 
companied by Brother Hintze (who 
formerly labored in the Turkish mis- 
sion and who has a knowledge of the 
language) and an Armenian brother, 
who wished to return to his own coun- 
try. The object of their going is to 
endeavor to secure a place of gather- 
ing for the Saints of the Orient, so 
that they may not be subjected to the 
restrictions that are imposed upon im- 
migrants to this land from those coun- 
tries. We do not know how successful 
they may be in their labors; but the 
word we have received is hopeful and 
encouraging. The Elders have been 
greatly blessed so far in their journey, 
and have been successful at their first 
meeting in baptizing quite a large 
number of people who were prepared 
to receive the Gospel, and also con- 
firming a number who had been bap- 
tized, but who had not been con- 
firmed because of the absence of a. 
bearer of the Melchisedek Priesthood. 
The brethren write very encourag- 
ingly on these matters, and we hope 
they will be successful in finding a. 
spot, if it be the Lord's will, whert 
the Saints of the Orient can commence 
to gather in that land, so that tnt 
principle of gathering, which the Lord 



is impressing strongly upon the minds 
of the converts to His Gospel, may be 
carried out there. 

The Twelve Apostles at home, as you 
all know, have been untiring in their 
labors in visiting the various confer- 
ences and laboring with the Saints to 
the extent of their ability. Brothers 
John Henry Smith and John W. Tay- 
lor, during a few weeks' absence, held 
100 meetings with the Saints in the 
various Stakes where they visited, and 
the reports that come to us show that 
these labors have been attended with 
excellent effects. 

The Seven Presidents of Seventies, 
also, either accompany the Twelve or 
go themselves. They are a traveling 
ministry, laboring very assiduously in 
their calling among the various Stakes 
— those of them who are home. As 
you know, two of their number are 
now in Europe, presiding over the 
European Mission — Brothers Rulon S. 
Wells and Joseph W. McMurrin. 

A new step has been taken, that is, 
to preach to the surrounding peoples. 
Our attention has been drawn to the 
states surrounding us. Brother John 
W. Taylor has been laboring in Color- 
ado with a number of Elders, and with 
great success. In Denver, Pueblo and 
other places they have been the mean* 
of bringing many to the knowledge of 
the truth. In Idaho and Montana, 
also, the Elders have been laboring 
and have done and are doing a good 
work in different places there, ana 
they report excellent results. The peo- 
ple are listening to them, and furnish- 
ing them with places where they can 
meet and preach to the people. In 
our own State we have heard of the 
brethren taking hold and visiting their 
neighbors who are not of our faith. 

There is a class of people in Utah 
who' think what they do not know 
about the Mormons and their doctrines 
is not worth knowing, and they are 
fill-/* with conceit respecting their 
knowledge of our principles, while they 
are densely ignorant concerning us. 
That which they do know is of so shal- 
low a character that it deceives them. 
They sometimes go away and talk to 
newspaper people, and tell what they 
know, and how long they have re- 
sided here, and yet they really do not 
know anything about us. But besides 
this class there is another, composed

of honest people who are not of our 
faith — honest, I mean, in regard to 
morality and in their conception of the 
truth. A man may be a very honest 
man financially, and yet not be honest 
enough to receive the truth of heaven. 
It is, therefore, no impugnment of a 
man's financial honesty to talk about 
his not being honest enough to re- 
ceive the truth. Some of the brethren 
thought they could do a good work in 
the different wards by visiting those 
who are not of our faith. Where this 
has been done, the reports are that it 
has been attended with excellent re- 
sults. Many of the people in the State 
have read our works with pleasure, 
and have expressed their confidence 
in their truth. 

This is a good thing. It is a labor 
that should be encouraged among us. 
Some of these people have complained 
of our exclusiveness. Of course, we. 
can understand why we are exclusive. 
We have had such a training as to 
make us to a great extent exclusive. 
They have had cause doubtless for 
thinking that we in our treatment of 
them, were exclusive; but where they 
have been brought in contact with our 
people, especially with our sisters, the 
effects, as reported to us, have in- 
variably been good. We have felt to 
encourage the Presidents of Stakes 
and the Bishops of wards in this labor, 
because we believe it will be attended 
with most excellent effects, and many 
may thus be brought to the knowl- 
edge of the truth. 

In California the work has been pro- 
gressing also in a very satisfactory 
manner. The President of the Cali- 
fornia Mission wrote a letter to the 
First Presidency a short time since, 
and said there were three Elders there 
that would like to have their wives 
sent to them, as they thought they 
could do a good work. About the 
same time we received a letter from 
the European Mission, the Presidency 
of which suggested that where the 
Elders could take their wives with 
them, and they were prudent women, 
they might do a great deal of good. 
Just about those days a letter came 
from a president of a Stake, saying 
there was a young couple in his Stake 
who were about to be married; but 
the young man had been called on a 
mission, and they delayed their mar- 



riage till they could ask some counsel. 
The young man and the young woman 
were both morally and physically 
capable of going on a mission, and 
they had sufficient means also. The 
question was asked, Would it be right 
for them to get married, and for the 
young lady to accompany her hus- 
band? The First Presidency wrote 
back, "Yes, if she is such a young 
woman as you describe; let her be sex. 
apart as a missionary and go with 
her husband and preach the Gospel 
as well as she can." We said the sam& 
In the president of the California mis- 
sion; we said, "Yes, if these wives are 
prudent women." We do not want 
unwise women sent any more than 
unwise men, because they could do 
more injury than they could do good. 
But if they can get a recommend from 
their Bishops as wise, suitable women, 
we will set them apart and send them 
to their husbands, if their husbands 
can bear the expense of their trans- 
portation. Since then two other ladies 
were going to Europe, and the appli- 
cation came up from the President of 
the Stake and his counselors to know 
whether they could not go in the ca- 
pacity of missionaries. They were 
capable young ladies; they had kin- 
dred in Europe, one a brother and the 
other an affianced, and the question 
was, what should be done about them. 
We sent word back, "Yes, if they .are 
the kind you describe, set them apart 
and let them go as missionaries to 
preach the Gospel, as far as they can, 
to their own sex and to others who 
will listen to them." It seems as 
though the Lord is preparing the way 
for the women of this Church to do 
some good in this direction. To some 
lands and under some circumstances 
suitable women might go with their 
husbands as missionaries and be able 
to do a great deal of good. 

The Presidency of the European 
mission wrote to us of several sisters 
who had been there with their hus- 
bands, and they described the good 
they had done and the good influence 
they had carried. It was illustrated 
by a conversation that was had a short 
time ago at one of our social gather- 
ings. Brother George D. Pyper and 
his wife had been East, and in the 
branch where they had visited there 
had been frequent expressions among

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



those who had not joined the Church 
to this effect: "Well, we have seen 
the Mormon Elders, but we have not 
seen the Mormon women; we would 
like to see some Mormon women, and 
see what kind of people they are." 
There was one woman of some prom- 
inence that had not joined the Church, 
though her husband had; but she had 
expressed herself several times in this 
manner. Sister Pyper visited there, 
and became acquainted with this lady, 
and the lady was so pleased at meet- 
ing one of our sisters— an intelligent 
woman, and a woman that did not 
look as thought she was a poor, down- 
trodden slave— that she entered the 
Church. No doubt, it was due to the 
fact that she had found that the 
women were as intelligent, as pre- 
sentable and as ladylike in their 
sphere as the gentlemen were in their 
sphere. This is encouraging, and it 
no doubt will enlarge our field of oper- 
ations to a very great extent. There 
will be an opportunity, doubtless, for 
women who are capable and who de- 
sire to do good, to go out, under 
proper conditions; not to go unattend- 
ed and alone— that would not be pru- 
dent—but where they have husbands 
who are going, and they are suitable 
in other respects, it would seem as 
though there would be no impropriety 
in their going and bearing their testi- 
mony. Of course, they cannot ad- 
minister the ordinances. It is not 
their province to officiate in the ordin- 
ances of the Gospel. But they can 
bear testimony; they can teach; the* 
can distribute tracts, and they can do 
a great many things that would as- 
sist in the propagation of the Gospei 
of the Lord Jesus Christ. 

Now, brethren and sisters, looking 
at all the work in its entirety, have 
we not cause to glorify God this day, 
at this Sixty-eighth Annual Confer- 
ence? Sixty-eight years the Church 
has been organized. We look back to 
our sorrows, our tribulations and that 
which the Saints have endured, but 
for those who have been faithful to 
the truth there is no sorrow mingled 
with our contemplation of those scenes, 
There is no cause to regret being 
steadfast and maintaining our integ- 
rity until today. And how does the 
future look? Radiant with promise, 



bright with hope, everything to en- 
courage us. 

We have our trials today of a finan- 
cial character. Our people, many ot 
them, are unemployed. In conse- 
quence of this, the counsel has been 
given to not send the Saints here from 
abroad, but rather to keen them in 
the branches until they get groundea 
in the faith. After a while, when they 
are established in the truth and are 
better able to endure the trials they 
will have to meet with in Zion, they 
can gather. But now it is not the 
voice of the Spirit that the Saints 
should gather from the nations of the 
earth as they have been doing, coming 
here full of inexperience, and then un- 
able to endure the trials that they have 
to contend with, and apostatize. Let 
them stay in their branches, and if 
they wish to apostatize let them apos- 
tatize there, without being at the 
trouble and expense of coming to Zion. 
In this way we may raise up strong 
branches, that will assist the Elders 
in the various fields of labor, and sus- 
tain and comfort them. This is the 
counsel that has been given to the 
Elders, and we think it correct coun- 
sel. In the meantime those at home 
can be strengthening themselves as 
best they can. As I say, we are pass- 
ing through trials of this character. 
There never has been a time since we 
have been in these mountains that we 
have had such things to contend with. 
In the early days there was scarcity 
of comforts and of money; but there 
was no debt. Now the great bulk of 
the people — that is, of the leading peo- 
ple — are in debt. The most prudent 
men among us have got entangled. 
This is the condition of the people. 
Shall we remain in this condition? 
President Woodruff says he hopes not. 
Now it is a good chance to prophesy; 
but I do not want to assume that role 
today. I feel assured, however, that 
we shall emerge from these financial 
troubles just as we have from other 
trials. I do not have the shadow of a 
doubt in my mind about it. But I do 
not wish to say what I feel, for I do 
not want to say too much about these 
things. But I think we have great 
cause for hope and encouragement. 
Looking at the past, and remember- 
ing the blessings that God has given

to us, the promises He has made to 
us, and the deliverances He has 
wrought our for us, I think we have 
cause to rejoice today and to put our 
trust in Him. He will bring us through 
if we will only serve Him. He will 
teach us where we are ignorant; He 
will give us knowledge, and knowl- 
edge is power. Because there is knowl- 
edge among the people is what makes 
this Church a rjowerful organization. 
The Lord has given unto us knowl- 
edge concerning many things. 

At the present time all Europe is 
preparing for war. They do not know 
what may arise out of these Chinese 
complications. America is disturbea 
by the prospects of war with Spain. 
Capitalists are endeavoring to keep 
their money in a position where they 
can handle and control it. A general 
feeling of unrest prevails throughout 
the nation. Now, as far as we are 
concerned, while we share to a certain 
extent in all these feelings (for we are 
part of this nation, and nothing can 
happen to the nation that will not 
affect us), there is among us an ab- 
sence of fear, a feeling of rest, an ab- 
sence of trepidation concerning the 
movements of the nation, and a senst 
of security that I believe no other peo- 
ple on the earth have. The reason of 
it is that we know that God doeth 
nothing, except He revealeth it unto 
His servants the Prophets. We know 
the spirit of prophecy is in our midst, 
and that if there is any danger threat- 
ening us we shall be prepared for it. 
The Lord will inspire His servants 
and His people so that they will not 
be found unprepared. 

God bless you, my brethren and sis- 
ters. God bless us all during this Con- 
ference; bless every man that shall 
speak, and inspire him with the Spirit 
and power of God; bless every one that 
shall listen that all may rejoice to- 
gether and be mutually edified; which 
I humbly ask in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 

PRESIDENT JOSEPH P. SMITH. 

Righteousness brings temporal as well as spiritual 
blessings — Some protessing to ba Saints not con- 
sistent. 

As a few minutes remain, I have been 
requested to bear my testimony. I 
think I can safely declare that the 



testimony which we have heard this: 
morning from President George Q. 
Cannon is, from first to last, true; and 
I do not hesitate to believe that all 
this congregation of Latter-day Saints 
can bear testimony to the truth of the 
remarks which we have heard. I cer- 
tainly bear my testimony to these 
things; for I not only know by ex- 
perience of their truth, but the Spirit 
of the Lord bears record of it to my 
heart, as I know it must do to all the 
Latter-day Saints. The Lord has 
sustained His people. He has guided 
His servants. He has opened up our 
way, and from time to time has lifted 
the clouds of persecution and of dark- 
ness that have lowered over oui 
heads, and caused the sunlight of joy 
and truth to shine down upon the 
Latter-day Saints. The Lord has 
blessed us in these valleys of the 
mountains, and has given us of His 
abundance; for He has made the earth 
fruitful for our sake. He has blessed 
us abundantly with the products of 
the earth and with rich return for our 
labors, wherein we have labored 
wisely and with prudence have used 
the blessings that the Lord has be- 
stowed upon us. Many of us may 
have been unwise in the management 
of our affairs, and because of this un- 
wisdom we today suffer the results of 
our own short-sightedness and folly. 
Where this has been the case, I hope 
and pray that we may profit by this 
experience for all time to eo::ie, and 
that in the future we will live nearer 
unto the Lord, that we 'may have more 
abundantly the light of His Spirit to 
guide us, not only in our spiritual 
affairs, but also in all temporal affairs. 
The work that we are engaged in is- 
not designed to be limited by the 
spiritual necessities of the people 
alone. It is the purpose of God in 
restoring the Gospel and the holy 
Priesthood, not only to benefit man- 
kind spiritually, but also to benefit 
them temporally. The Lord has ex- 
pressed this many times, in the word 
that He gave to His servant Joseph 
Smith the Prophet; He designed that 
His people should become the richest 
of all people. And this not only means* 
the richest of all people in heavenly 
gifts— in spiritual blessings and riches, 
but it also means that the people of 
God shall be the richest of all people

with regard to temporal matters, li 
faithful we have a right to claim the 
blessings of the Lord upon the labor 
of our hands, our temporal labors. 
The farmer has a right to ask the 
Lord for blessings upon his farm, upon 
the labor that he bestows upon it. 
He has a right to claim the blessings 
of the Lord upon the animals that are 
necessary to the cultivation of his 
farm. He has a right to ask God to 
bless the grain that he sows and the 
seeds of the fruit that he plant*, hi 
the soil. It is his privilege, not only 
to ask and claim these blessings a' the 
hand of the Lord, but it is his right 
and privilege to receive blessings from 
God upon his labor, upon his farm, 
and upon all that he puts his hand 
unto in righteousness. It is our priv- 
ilege to ask God to remove the curse 
from the earth, and to make it fruit- 
ful. If we will live that we shall be 
entitled to His favor, and that we 
may justly and righteously clpim the 
blessings and gifts that He has prom- 
ised unto His Saints, then that which 
we ask will be given, and we shall 
receive and enjoy them more abund- 
antly. It is our privilege to ask God 
to bless the elements that surround 
us and to temper them for our good, 
and we know He will hear and anrwer 
the prayers of His people, ace-mling 
to their faith. Read the Scriptures, if 
we believe them, and the testimonies 
that are there borne of the dealings 
of God with ancient Israel, and see how 
God blessed the people when they 
were faithful in keeping His c m- 
mandments. The earth was made 
fruitful for them. Their vines did not 
cast their fruit before their time Ihey 
were free from mildew, and from 
rust, and from the devouring insects, 
and from drouth, and from every 
casualty and destructive evil. They 
were prospered in their outgoings and 
in their incomings, and they had 
abundance, when they served the 
Lord. This is according to the history 
that has been written of the dealings 
of God with His ancient people. They 
were blessed with the earlv and the 
latter rains, and the earth was made 
fruitful for them. "When from Lcoes- 
sity they went out to battle against 
their enemies, their enemies fled be- 
fore them seven ways, as the Scrip- 
tures tell us. In every way did Goa 



bless and prosper them, and made 
them notable among the nations of the 
earth. But when they forgot their 
tithes and their offerings; when they 
forgot their prayers, and became re- 
bellious and disobedient to the laws 
and requirements of God, then were 
the rains withheld, and the earth be- 
came dust beneath their feet, their 
vines cast their fruit before their 
time; they yere cursed with the blight, 
and with the mildew, and with the 
rust, and with the grasshopper, and 
with the devouring insects, until the> 
were brought down low : u poverty ana 
in distress. The Lord felt after the 
people in ancient times in this way. 
(See Deut. 28.) 

Now, what was true respecting 
God's dealings with the people of 
Israel in ancient days is true ar.3 ap- 
plicable today. 

This is my testimony anil 1 believe 
this would be the testimony of every 
faithful Latter-day ?aint. Every man 
and woman who has labored in faith 
and humility, putting their trust in 
the Lord, have this testimony in their 
hearts. But those who have labored 
without faith, without h>pr : . without 
charity; those who ha /a not put their 
trust in the Lord, who have heevme 
worldly; who have allowed the spirit 
of skepticism to enter into th'-.ir hearts; 
who have labored ai the infidel labors, 
without regard to the duties that men 
owe to God — such .is these may in- 
deed be ba-ren of thifc lrnowl.^lgtv and 
testimony, and may be without the 
consolation, assurance and strength 
this testimony gives. 

I am not unaware of the fact that 
there is more or less infidelity and 
skepticism in the hearts of the people, 
i am aware of the fact that some arc 
indifferent to the duties that devolve 
upon us as Latter-day Saints. We 
have exhibitons of this spirit of infi- 
delity, of ridicule and of recklessness 
day after day as we walk along the 
streets and as we observe the con- 
duct of men. We see it upon the Sab- 
bath day, when men professing to be 
members of the Churcn should be but 
are not honoring the Sabbath and 
keeping it holy. We see it when we 
take into consideration the require- 
ments the Lord has made of His peo- 
ple with regard to the Word of Wis- 
dom and contrast the same with Iboir

doings. As we pass up and down the 
streets, and as we »o from place to 
place we see how iitt'.e regard is paid 
by a certain class to tliis instruction 
that has been given l<> the people to 
make them Saints. We only need to 
go to the mercantile houses in tht- 
country and enquire there as to the 
amount of useless and hurtful things 
which are imported into the country 
and sold day by day and year fov year 
to the people. Some of our pretended 
pious people, a few years ago, Avert? 
shocked and horrified by seeing the 
symbol of the All-Seeing Eye find the 
words "Holiness to the Lord" in gilt 
letters over the front of Zion's Co- 
operative Mercantile Institution. Es- 
pecially was this the case with sonic 
of our brethren when they found these 
letters over the drug department of 
Z. C. M. I. Why was it? Why some 
of these pious(?) Mormons round that 
Z. C. M. I., under rhe symbol of the 
All-seeing Eye and the sacred words, 
"Holiness to the Lord,' - sold tea and 
coffee, and tobacco, and other things 
possibly that Latter-dav Saints ought 
not to use; and at the drug store, 
Z. C. M. I. kept liquors of various 
kinds for medicinal purposes. It was 
terribly shocking to some of the L&t- 
ter-day Saints that under these holy 
words liquor should be kept for sale. 
Has it ever injured me, in any sense 
of the word, because Z. C. M. I. drug 
store kept liquor for .jale? Has it made 
me a drunkard? Have £ been under 
-the necessity of guzzling liquid poison? 
Have I made myself a sot because 
liquor was kept for sale by Z C. M. I.? 
I am not the worse for it, thank the 
Lord. And who else is? No one, ex- 
cept those pious Mormon st '•') who in 
open day or under the cover of night 
would go into the drug store and buy 
liquor to drink. They are the ones, of 
all others, who of course would be h< r- 
rified at the fact that liquor was sold 
in a place of merchandise. Those 
who were the most horrified at seeing 
the All-Seeing Eye and "Holiness to 
the Lord" over the front door of Z. C. 
M. I., I will guarantee are the ones 
that have bought the most tea and 
coffee, tobacco and whisky there. 
Anybody will apostatize with that 
sort of a spirit, if they do not repen\. 
of it, because it is a sordid, bigoted, 



short-sighted and .hypocritical spirit. 
Latter-day Saints cannot afford to in- 
dulge in such actions or conduct as 
this, nor to harbor this spirit in their 
hearts. It does not matter to me how 
much tea and coffee Z. O. M. I. sells, 
so long as I do not buy it. If I do not 
drink it am I not all right ? And if 
the poor creature that wants it can 
get it there, that ought to satisfy hiin. 
If he could not get it there, he would 
not patronize Z. C. M. T, at all, but 
would go somewhere else to deal. 

But the object I had in view !n re- 
ferring to this matter was to bring to 
your minds how reckless some of the 
people are with regard to keeping the 
commandments of God, and how many 
of us will strain at a gnat and swallow 
a camel; how many of us will criticise 
and find fault with that which exists 
only in our own imagination, while 
we ourselves are guilty of a great 
deal worse things than that which 
we criticise and condemo. 

May the Lord bless the people, and 
although many of us are not living 
up to our privileges and are not worthy 
to claim the fullness of the blessings 
of the Gospel upon our heads, T pra> 
God that He will forgive our sins, 
that He will bear patiently with us, 
that He will extend to us long suffer- 
ing and forgiveness and the assistance 
of His Holy Spirit, that whereas to- 
day we are beset with weaknesses 
and imperfections and we come far 
short. we may in time im- 
prove, repent of our sins, and become 
regenerated, that we may enjoy the 
fullness of the blessings of the Gospel, 
which I ask in the name of Jesus. 
Amen.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



PRESIDENT LORENZO SNOW. 

Necessity for Divine assistance — Leading object of 
our present life — The Saints should be progres- 
sive — The United Order. 

I take pleasure in occupying this 
position a short time, and with the aid 
of your prayers and the exercise of 
your faith, I would like to say some- 
thing- that will prove of mutual benefit. 
It is the privilege of Latter-clay 
Saints who have entered into cove- 
nants with the Lord, who has revealed 
Himself in these lattsr times, to con- 
stantly improve, and especially under 
circumstances of the present where 
we assemble together and can exercise 
our faith in the interest of those who 
address us. And no Latter-day 
Saints should withdraw from an as- 
semblage of this character without 
having received something that will 
be of importance in the future scenes 
of their lives. In and of ourselves we 
cannot possibly comply with all the 
commandments that God has given 
unto us. Jesus himself could not with- 
out divine aid from His Father ac- 
complish His work. He said on one 
occasion, "I can of mine own self do 
nothing, as I hear I judge and my 
judgment is just because I seek not 
my own will but the will of the Fath- 
er who sent me." And we, if it was 
necessary for Him, our Lord, to have 
divine assistance, will fmd it all the 
more important to receive His as- 
sistance. And in every circumstance 
and condition surrounding tru» Latter- 
day Saints, while in the performance 
of their duties, they are entitled to 
supernatural aid from the Holy Spirit, 
to help in the various conditions sur- 
rounding them, and in the duties that 
they are required to perform. 

It is a mighty and glorious work in 
which we are engaged, and its bene- 
fits, so far as we accomplish the la- 
bors assigned us, are attended with 
the highest advantages to ourselves. 
I cannot imagine anything ihat is so 
vastly important as to work for and 
obtain one's own individual exalta- 
tion ond glory. That undoubtedly Is 
one great purpose for which we came 
into the world. When we lived in the 
other life we had no doubt some under- 
standing with reference to our duties 
in this life when we were permitted 
to come to this our second estate. 



And very likely we put ourselves under 
certain obligations that we would dis- 
charge certain duties devolving upon 
us when we came here into our sec- 
ond estate. And we had rendered our- 
selves worthy to come upon this earth 
for the purpose of securing those 
blessings that could only be obtained 
by observing the laws pertaining to 
our present estate. There are many 
important things required at our 
hands, and many things which we 
can do, when assisted by the Spirit of 
the Lord, which may at times seem 
almost Impossible to accomplish, and 
no man or woman should be discour- 
aged when they feel that they cannot 
complete what they would like to per- 
form, but we all should do what we 
can toward carrying out the grand 
work for which we are here. Paul 
said, he pressed forward toward the 
mark in the high calling of God in 
Christ Jesus. Now this is a very good 
principle for us to keep constantly be- 
fore us day by day, month by month 
and year by year. We should labor 
for perfection so far as possible, and 
seek to go onward. There is no man 
or woman who can stand still any 
great length of time. In this path 
over which we are moving we are very 
likely to go backward if we undertake 
to stand still or act indifferently. We 
must push forward, because as the 
Church moves on, it is very evident 
that things of a more difficult char- 

' r are occurring constantly, and we 
will find it far from easy to overcome 
♦hem. Unless we improve as we move 
along we will find it very difficult to 
magnify our callings and to perform 
the work required at our hands. 
Latter-day Saints should not permit 
themselves to stand still. It is a priv- 
ilege we have to serve the Lord and 
enjoy His spirit in our labors, but 
many of the people lose that portion 
of happiness that they might enjoy 
because of not reflecting seriously 
upon their duties and acting wisely 
and prudently. 

We are told that the Lord will re- 
veal unto our minds things past, 
things present, and things to come. 
There is a certain amount of qualifica- 
tion that could be had by becoming 
possessed of a knowledge of things 
that are past; that is to say, in 
reference to ourselves, to the things 



PRESIDENT LOREAZO SNOtt. 



13 



we have done in the past — those duties 
imposed upon us. There is a satisfac- 
tion and an enjoyment in such reflec- 
tions. And then when we reflect upon 
the future, and the exaltation that the 
XiOrd proposes to bestow upon us there 
is joy in that. There is great enjoy- 
ment to be had in having done right in 
the past and meditating upon the 
fact, and feeling that we are doing 
right now, because it is the privilege 
of every Latter-day Saint to know 
when he is doing that which pertains 
to the things of the Lord. If our past 
conduct has been such, and our pres- 
ent conduct is such that we will be 
entitled to receive glory and exalta- 
tion, and have our bodies free from 
•disease and death, and be crowned 
with immortal glory in the midst of 
-our wives, children and friends, 
worlds without end, these are contem- 
plations which cause us to enjoy our- 
selves. This is the way Latter-day 
Saints should live. At present a great 
■deal of trouble, anxieties and vexa- 
tions are experienced by the Latter- 
day Saints, but we want to overcome 
these things and be qualified for the 
important duties required at our hands. 
The man who is sick is disqualified 
to act in things required of a healthy 
man. There is this privilege that 
every Latter-day Saint should seek to 
•enjoy, to know positively that his work 
is accepted of God. I am afraid Lat- 
ter-day Saints are not much better 
and perhaps they are worse than other 
people if they do not have this knowl- 
edge and seek to do right. 

Paul was caught up to the third 
heaven, and he heard and saw things 
that were of the highest advantage to 
him, and, although he was not per- 
mitted to say what he saw and heard 
there, on account of the hardness of 
the hearts of the people, we can see 
the effects of it in his teachings and 
writings in that day. Paul said: "Let 
this mind be in you, which was also in 
Christ Jesus, who, being in the form 
of God, thought it not robbery to be 
equal with God." Well, that was an 
extraordinary expression for Paul to 
make at that time, but there was some- 
thing in it. John says: "Beloved, 
now are we the sons of God, and it 
doth not yet appear what we shall be, 
but we know that when He shall ap- 
pear we shall be like Him, for we 



shall see Him as He is, and every man 
that hath this hope in him purifies 
himself, even as He is pure." 

Every man having this hope in him 
purifies himself. There then naturally 
arises a determination to work for that 
high and noble position, to work foi 
those wonderful promises made, 
^here is an inducement to pursue a 
course of righteousness. 

In this system of religion that you 
and I have received there is something 
grand and glorious, and something 
new to learn every day, that is of 
great value. And it is not only our 
privilege but it is necessary that we 
receive these things and gather these 
new ideas. This Church, in its travels 
from the beginning, has passed 
through, as was told by President 
Cannon this morning, the most severe 
trials which tried the heart and soul 
of every man and woman in it. Now 
if we had not been pretty fair Latter- 
day Saints in the past we- could not 
have done as well as we have, and we 
could not have looked back with so 
much pleasure on what we have ac- 
complished. When we get into the 
other life and look back upon our past 
s, which we will undoubtedly un- 
derstand, some of our actions will be 
of the highest pleasure to reflect upon, 
and will add to our enjoyment in the 
future life. For instance, Abraham, 
hen he reflects upon what he ac- 
complished in this life, when in obedi- 
ence to the command of God he took 
his only son, through whom he had 
been promised glorious blessings, up 
on the high mountain and was about 
to sacrifice him. The Lord praised 
him for doing this. Now if Abraham 
had not been faithful for some time be- 
fore this happened he would not have 
been able to accomplish this thing. We 
ought to improve ourselves and move 
faster toward the point of perfection. 
It is said that we cannot be perfect. 
Jesus has commanded us to be perfect 
even as God, the Father, is perfect. 
It is our duty to try to be perfect, and 
it is our duty to improve each day, 
and look upon our course last week 
and do things better this week; do 
things better today than we did them 
yesterday, and go on and on from one 
degree of righteousness to another. 
Jesus will come by and by, and ap- 
pear in our midst, as He appeared in 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the day when upon the earth among 
the Jews, and He will eat and drink 
with us and talk to us, and explain 
the mysteries of the Kingdom, and 
tell us things that are not lawful to 
talk about now. 

We are going back to Jackson 
county, Missouri, one of these days. 
Now if it was proper to wish it I would 
r.ot care if it was tomorrow, if word 
should come for us to go back to 
Jackson county and build up a great 
city there. The day will come when 
Latter-day Saints will be selected — all 
may not be called at once, but those 
who are worthy will be called. There 
will be no poverty in that day. There 
will be plenty of food, clothing and 
other necessaries of life; and the 
father who has a family, if called 
suddenly to depart this life, will 
know that his wife and children will 
be taken care of, that provision will 
be made for their sustenance and com- 
fort. But this is the United Order that 
we sometimes hear mentioned, but 
the time perhaps has not yet come to 
establish it. But the Latter-day Saints 
will never be satisfied with any other 
arrangement that might be proposed. 
The nations of the earth have for a 
long time been trying to establish 
some principle by which they can be 
financially sustained, united and live 
in peace, but have not succeeded. 
But the Lord has revealed a principle 
clearly and definitely so that there 
will oe no mistake about it. The sys- 
tem will bring financial union to the 
Latter-day Saints, and we will be sat- 
isfied with it as we are now with the 
principles of the Gospel. It will suit 
us. It is something that is natural. 
And then you and I will have no 
trouble about our children's temporal 
welfare. This will take place and who- 
ever goes to Jackson county will meet 
with that sympathy and friendship 
that were not met with in early days, 
and because of Ihe absence of which 
the people were allowed to be driven 
out. 

These are things for the Latter-day 
Saints ;ind fcr every man and woman 
to think about, and we should cum- 
m.-nt' t-> prepare and fit ourselves (Vr 
the United Order. As far as spiritual 
things are concerned we are pretty 
well united, but when it comes to 
temporalities we often differ. But you 



will see the day, if you live properly, 
observe the Word of Wisdom a»id *o 
that which is required, you wnl go 
back to Jackson county, many of you 
whom I am addressing this afternoon. 
I am sure of this. 

God bless you brethren and sisters, 
and also President Woodruff, the most 
remarkable man that dwells on the 
face of the earth, and whom the Lord 
has most wonderfully blessed during 
all the scenes of life. It is grand and 
glorious to think what the Lord has 
accomplished with Brother Woodruff, 
and with the Saints generally. God 
bless you, is my prayer continually, 
Amen. 

ELDER HEBER J. GRANT. 
The need of inspiration — The true pjth of duty. 

It is a source of pleasure to me to 
once more meet with the Latter-day 
Saints in General Conference, and 1 
hope that what shall be spoken here 
this afternoon may be for our mutual 
benefit. It has ever been my desire 
in addressing the Latter-day Saints, 
that my mind might be lighted up with 
the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. I 
realize that, in teaching the people, 
unless the speaker is inspired of our 
Father in Heaven it is impossible to 
say anything that will be of benefit or 
worth to the Saints. I have nothing 
particular upon my mind that I desire 
to talk upon in addressing you this af- 
ternoon. I have enjoyed the remarks 
of the brethren who have spoken thus 
far during this Conference, and I hopt= 
that during its continuance we will be 
blessed with the light and inspiration 
of the Spirit from on high. I rejoice 
in the many testimonies of the truth- 
fulness of the Gospel that I have re- 
ceived. I rejoice in the evidence that 
comes to me from time tO' time, in 
my labors, of the goodness of God to 
me and also to you — to one and all. I 
find, in mingling with the Latter-day 
Saints, that all who are striving to 
keep the commandments of the Lord 
are abundantly blessed, and they rea- 
lize that our Heavenly Father is with 
them, and rejoice in their hearts be- 
cause of His goodness toward them. 

When we stop to contemplate the 
great hardships that our fathers and 
mothers have had to pass through in 
establishing the work of God in the 
earth, it should cause us to be thank- 



ELDER HEBER J. GRANT.

ful because of our comparatively pleas- 
ant surroundings. I sometimes feel 
that we know but little of their sor- 
rows, and of what they have had to 
endure. When we realize how easy 
it is for us to live we cannot begin to 
imagine what hardships they have had 
to pass through. I am truly grate- 
ful that I have not been called to en- 
dure such trials. I never had a desire, 
myself, to have experiences of this 
kind. We sometimes meet people who 
say they would like to have witnessed 
the trials of the early Saints and taken 
a part in them, but I have no wish to 
nominate myself for a martyr. I tell 
you what I do desire; it is to be tested 
and tried only so far as is necessary 
to qualify me for the duties which 
have been imposed upon me, and to 
gain an exaltation in the presence of 
my Heavenly Father. 

I regret exceedingly that from my 
earliest recollections I have had to lis- 
ten to the servants of the Lord plead- 
ing, with very little success, with the 
people to live their religion. My own 
counsel and advice to the Latter-day 
Saints have been to do their duties to- 
wards God and to keep the command- 
ments that He has given them. Not- 
withstanding the brethren have labored 
hard to teach the Saints their duties, 
and have frequently repeated the com- 
mandments of the Lord unto this peo- 
ple, many of them have not yet learned 
the necessity of performing their duties. 
I believe if I were to call for those peo- 
ple here today who have been taught 
and believe all the revelations contained 
in the book of Doctrine and Covenants 
to be the inspired words of God, and 
that Joseph Smith was a Prophet of 
God, nearly all who are in this congre- 
gation would raise their hands and say 
they knew these things to be true. But 
if I were to call for all those who had 
been absolutely honest with God in 
keeping His commandments, I am 
afraid a majority of the congregation 
would not raise their hands. If I were 
to ask for those who observed the 
Word of Wisdom, and who did not 
spend a portion of their means for to- 
baco and liquor, and who paid an hon- 
est tithing to the Lord, one-half of 
those here today would, I am afraid, 
fail to lift their hands. A great 
majority would answer that they had 
received their endowments in the tem- 



ple of God, that they had entered into 
covenants with the Lord. They know 
the covenants that they have made 
with our Heavenly r ather, and how 
many are there who carry out these 
covenants that they have entered into? 
I have heard a great many people, in 
my time, pray unto the Lord for bless- 
ings. And they would dedicate their 
time and strength and all that they 
possessed for the onward advancement 
of the Kingdom of God, but when they 
are called upon to help the Church in 
a financial way they are very careful 
to keep their means hid from the Lord— 
they keep it for their own advancement. 
We are not ready and willing to keep 
the commandments of God, but we are 
ready and willing to carry out our own 
wishes. We do not ask what it is de- 
sired that we should do, but generally 
suit ourselves as to what we would like 
to do. Is this right? No, it is not. I 
feel that there is plenty of room for im- 
provement, and we should improve. 

We heard this morning about some 
of the trials and tribulations our fath- 
ers had to pass through, and President 
Cannon said he expected to see the day 
when our financial troubles would van- 
ish, as our other troubles have dis- 
appeared. I have faith that all those 
who have been honest with God in the 
past will scon be delivered from the 
bondage of debt. I expect that a great 
many of the Latter-day Saints, be- 
fore the clay of that deliverance, will 
be made to remember the covenants 
which they have made with the Lord. 
They have not been honest with the 
Lord. As one of the inspired men of 
old said, the people had robbed the 
Lord in their tithes and offerings.. I 
say when the Latter-day Saints will 
pay an honest tithing unto the Lord 
there will be no need of talking about 
debts and of being in the bondage of 
debt. But the trouble is we do not do 
it. Scores of men compromise with 
the Lord on the basis of 10 cents on 
the dollar, and they rob Him of the 
other 90 cents. They discount their 
debts to the Lord 25 per cent. Why, a 
man would be ashamed of himself to 
go into Z. C. M. I. and ask it to knock 
off 25 per cent from his bill, but with 
God they discount their bills 10 cents, 
25 cents and 50 cents on the dollar, 
and then call themselves honest. I 
wish the Lord would inspire us with 



1 6 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



3 determination to be honest, and that 
the brethren could inspire this feeling 
among the Latter-day Saints, so that 
we would all try to be upright witl 
the Lord. A man will say, "I owe m> 
neighbor and must pay him before 1 
■can settle my tithing." Well, I know i 
owe lots of my neighbors, and they try 
to collect from me. But I owe God an 
honest tithing;. He has given me a 
testimony of Jesus and a hope of eter- 
nal life, and I intend to pay Him first 
and my neighbors afterwards. It Is 
our duty to settle with the Lord first, 
and I intend to do it, with the help of 
my Heavenly Father. And I want 
to say to you, if you will be honest 
-with the Lord, paying your tithing and 
^keeping His commandments, He will 
not only bless you with the light and 
inspiration of His Holy Spirit, but you 
will be blessed in dollars and cents, 
you will be enabled to pay your debts, 
and the Lord will pour out temporal 
blessings upon you in great abund- 
ance. 

May the Lord bless and guide us by 
the inspiration of His Spirit always, 
is my prayer in the name of Jesus 
'Christ. Amen. 

ELDER FRANKLIN D. RICHARDS. 

Early Church experiences— Revelations of the Gos- 
pel—Faithful payment of tithes— New wine in old 
bottles— Destiny of our children— A work for all 
to do. 

I esteem it a very precious favor to 
be privileged to meet with the Saints 
In their general Conference; indeed, at 
all times in their assemblages; and be- 
ing called upon to speak to you thia 
afternoon, I greatly desire that meas- 
ure of the Spirit that will enable me 
to speak to your edification, as I re- 
alize that without it our time will be 
unprofitably spent. We have had, 
since the opening of this Conference, 
a great deal of precious instructions, 
and recalling of past circumstances to 
refresh our minds with things that are 
important and profitable unto us. 

I was thinking, while listening to 
the former speakers, how it was with 
us in the beginning of this work. Peo- 
ple that are born into the Church now, 
enter into the various temporal pur- 
suits, such as have been spoken ot 
by previous speakers, and they seem 
to think the duty of paying tithing 
is simply *a matter of convenience. Out 



youngsters born in the Church now, 
a good many of them, do not enter 
into the spirit of this work as it was 
entertained in the beginning. 

Now my mind is carried back to the 
time when the Gospel came to me and 
to my kindred, in the state of Massa 
chusetts, in the year 1838, when 1 
embraced it. The way we looked upon 
these things was somewhat on thia 
wise: We were willing to have our 
names cast out as evil. If we had 
any earthly substance at all ws, 
were willing to lay it upon the altai 
of sacrifice for the Lord, who gave it 
to us. We dedicated it unto Him foi- 
the establishment of His Church and 
kingdom. We did not stop there. The 
law of tithing had not been revealed at 
that time; but, in addition to the good 
name that we held among our friends 
and neighbors, we gave a,ll that we 
had and then we placed ourselves 
upon the altar with whatever we had, 
or should have, to be given to the 
Lord in consideration of the blessed 
Gospel that he had revealed to us. We 
felt that this was our reasonable duty, 
as well as our acceptable service. It 
was with that spirit that people joined 
the Church in those days when the 
Gospel was presented to them. It was 
in those times that Presidents Wood- 
ruff and Snow and others embraced 
the Gospel, when it was first preached 
among the people. We gave every- 
thing to the Lord, feeling that it was 
not our own, but belonged to Him, to 
do just as He wished with it. We 
started in to keep the commandments 
and were baptized for the remission 
of our sins, and we received the Holy 
Ghost as a Comforter throughout our 
future lives; and then, when we came 
to that, oh! how we felt paid for 
everything .that we had done, and for 
every sacrifice we had made! 

I remember well the first testimony 
of the Holy Spirit that was given to 
me, in the first blessing of healing that 
was conferred upon me when I had 
been laid up with sickness for a long 
time. It was between Grand Prairie 
and Missouri, during a snow storm, 
such as we had last Sunday, with from 
four to six inches of snow on the 
ground. I was traveling on foot to 
Missouri. I recollect, on that blessed, 
snowy day, how glorious all things 
were to me. Although at this time 



ELDER FRANKIN D. RICHARDS 



17 



the Prophet had been put in prison, 
and about thirty of the brethren were 
also imprisoned, it was revealed to 
me that this was the work of the 
Lord, and that God was going to 
bring' it out triumphantly. I knew 
the Gospel was true, although I had 
not yet seen the Prophet Joseph 
Smith. The Lord revealed it to me, 
and I knew that Brother Joseph was 
a Prophet, not by man's testimony, 
but in the same way that Peter knew 
that the Lord Jesus Christ was the 
Savior, when the Lord asked, "But 
whom say ye that I am?" and Peter 
answered, "Thou art Christ, the Son 
of the living God." And Christ said, 
"Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona: 
for flesh and blood hath not revealed 
it unto thee, but my Father which is 
in heaven." I had prayed to God for 
a knowledge of this Gospel, and when 
I received this blessing I felt that if I 
owned the world I would willingly 
give it to the Lord for the further- 
ance of His work. When we received 
the Gospel and the testimony of the 
Holy Ghost, we realized that we had 
indeed found the "Pearl of Great 
Price," and the weaver of God was 
upon us and in our hearts. How 
glorious it was to listen to the inspired 
men in that day, expounding the 
Scriptures and explaining the prophe- 
cies made by Daniel about the stone 
being cut out without hands. We en- 
tertained no idea of the circumstances 
that would attend the rolling forth of 
that stone spoken of by Daniel, which 
was to roll forth and fill the whole 
earth. We were but few in number 
then, but have now lived to see the 
Church grow from a few hundred to 
some 250,000 souls. 

The law of tithing was not revealed 
at that time, but we were commanded 
to carry on the work with our means. 
The Temple at Kirtland was built in 
this way. The Saints did all the work 
they could on the building, and then 
went out and obtained work here and 
there, and with the money they earned 
they purchased those things that were 
necessary for its completion. It was 
done by sacrificing all that they had; 
and when we had done all that we 
could do, Oh! how joyous it was to 
know the Lord accepted the work, 

when He stood upon the breastwork 
2 



of the Temple, conversed with the 
Prophet Joseph and Oliver, and re- 
vealed to them their duties, and in- 
formed them that the Gospel should go 
from there and be preached throughout 
the nations of the earth. It had not 
then he preached throughout the 
United States even, because the north- 
ern men were called abolitionists, and 
the southern slaveholders had no use 
for us and would not tolerate us, but 
now it can be spread throughout the 
nation. 

What an easy thing it is to pay ten 
per cent as a tithing unto the Lord! I 
think this principle should be taken 
into the Sabbath schools and the Mutu- 
al Improvement Associations through- 
out Zion, and taught to the young at 
home. They should be taught that 
this is one of the means of salvation 
in the Church and Kingdom of God, 
and if they are thoroughly taught this 
principle while young they will take to 
it just as naturally as small ducks take 
to water, but if you wait until they 
grow up before teaching them to pay 
their tithing, they will want to keep 
it in their pockets. They see father do 
it, and if father may do it, certainly 
it is not wrong for the boys to follow 
the father's example. 

Now this great work we are engaged 
in, my brethren and sisters, is truly 
wonderful. The Lord's Spirit has gone 
forth among the children of men, and 
they are beginning to listen to* the 
Elders. The Lord has shed forth His 
Spirit upon the nations of the earth, 
causing mankind to look for the com- 
ing of the Lord. The Lord has taught 
us through revelation to pray for His 
coming with His Kingdom and power 
(Doctrine and Covenants, Sec. 65;, 
that we may be prepared for it, and 
that we may be in a condition to re- 
ceive further revelation as our cir- 
cumstances require. What have we 
had given to us since we began to 
pray for these blessings? Why, my 
brethren and sisters, it has been a 
stream of revelation ever since. When 
I first heard the Prophet speak, it was 
a stream of revelation to me. He was 
placed in prison, and, when he re^ 
ceived his liberty again, he went right 
to work shepherding the Saints at. 
Nauvoo and round about there. In 
those days we had not heard of bap-

tism for the dead. I remember when 
the Prophet brought forth that doc- 
trine. To some it was so strong it was 
like putting new wine into old bottles, 
some of them broke and the wine spilt 
out, losing both bottle and wine. We 
could not fully comprehend so glorious 
a principle. We did not receive every- 
thing at once, but it was given to us 
line upon line, and in this way it has 
been coming to us ever since as our 
circumstances have required. 

Now, are we living up to these things 
as fast as we get them? And are we 
living by "every word that proceedeth 
from the mouth of God?" Are we pre- 
paring ourselves for the work that is 
before us? Are we just in the work 
of preparation? I look upon it that our 
children who are just growing up as 
intimated by President Snow, are the 
ones who will be permitted to build the 
New Jerusalem. You know the world 
has departed from the Lord and from 
the principles employed in building up 
Enoch's city, and we and our fathers 
have wandered from the Lord in our 
spiritual affairs. And we are trying to 
be converted to the will of the Lord 
in our spiritual things, so that we may 
become converted in temporal things. 
We are trying to understand the Gos- 
pel as Enoch understood it and as 
Christ understood it, and to do busi- 
ness as they did it, living in co-opera- 
tion and managing our affairs in the 
same way, but many of us are not 
willing to be taught in temporal mat- 
ters. We should seek to carry out the 
commandments of the Lord. We must 
teach our children, our families and 
friends and unite in building up the 
Kingdom of God. 

We sometimes forget these things 
are required by the Lord in building up 
His Kingdom. They are the material 
things God requires of us. For our 
earthly existence, and for the fruits of 
the earth that the Lord gives us, and 
for everything we should be thankful. 
We are educating our Sabbath school 
children to grow up and qualify them- 
selves to become apostles, judges, 
bishops and all manner of officers in 
the Church that shall be needed to rule 
the Kingdom of God. And our young 
men should think upon these things 
and remember that some time the power 
and authority will come upon them to 
enable them to discharge these various 



duties. This is the precious land of 
Zion, to be occupied by God's people. 
When we first came here, we could 
scarcely imagine that we would be- 
come 250,000 in number. What is it to 
be in the next sixty years if we con- 
tinue our teaching the word of the 
Lord? We should realize that we are 
in a state of preparation, preparing 
our generations after us to live better 
than we, and to become sanctified in 
the Church. 

We ought to have a generation in a 
little while prepared to go down and 
build up the New Jerusalem, accord- 
ing to the promises of the Lord in re- 
vealing the everlasting Gospel unto us. 
We are living too much upon the frac- 
tional part of the faith, as Brother 
Grant has been telling us. We should 
know that our course is right, and then 
continue in it. It is not half so im- 
portant for our neighbors to know that 
we are honest as it is for ourselves to 
know it. We should prepare ourselves 
to build up Zion, and we ought not 
think these things so far off as we do, 
for it will not be long before we are 
called upon to do this work. We ought 
to raise men that are fully qualified to 
go into the world and build up the 
Church and spread the Gospel, thereby 
building up Zion. We should be will- 
ing to work to this end. We want to 
increase our 1,700 missionaries now in 
the field until we can get 200,000 out, 
and until the work of the Lord can be 
echoed from sea to sea, and from the 
north to the south. I want you to un- 
derstand, brethren, that we have not 
come to a comfortable place, to squat 
down on it not to move again, but we 
should labor and send forth the Gos- 
pel to the nations of the earth, and help 
to build up Zion, and the man who is 
too old to go abroad should work here 
and help the younger men to go. 

There is work for all to do. It is 
our duty to teach righteousness in the 
earth. It is your business as truly as 
it is the business of President Woodruff 
or any of us, to preach and work 
righiteousnes in the earth. I delight in 
the work of the Lord. We have a 
great work in hunting up Elders to 
send abroad to preach to. the people. 
Our Elders should feel that we owe a 
duty to the human family. It is our 
duty to help to gather Israel and help 
to build up Zion, not with the tenth of

our incomes only, but with all that we 
have; directly and indirectly we should 
give all. 

Well, we are beginning to see what 
is before us. We are beginning to un- 
derstand what blessings await those 
who are faithful and truthful in all 
things, and to understand what our 
duties are. 

I pray that the Lord will impart 
strength unto us, and inspire us in our 
duties and make the fruits of our la- 
bors to be seen in our present life. And 
I pray the Lord to bless us with His 
spirit while we are together, so that 
Israel may read of the good time we 
have had. And I want to tell you, 
brethren, that these things spoken of 
regarding the coming of the Lord are 
not so far off. We have been praying 
to our Heavenly Father, whom we do 
not behold; but His Spirit is here and 
He answers our prayers, just as when 
we talk through a telephone we are 
answered, although we do not see the 
person with whom we are talking, and 



so it is with our Heavenly Father. The 
three great patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac 
and Jacob, started with a small be- 
ginning, and revelation tells us that 
they have become Gods, and the prom- 
ise was given to -them that their seed 
should be as numerous as the sands 
upon the seashore. We are their child- 
ren, and are not the blessings of Abra- 
ham, Issac and Jacob our blessings? 
It is our privilege to be exalted in the 
presence of Father Abraham. We have 
great encouragement to work right- 
eousness and to qualify ourselves to 
teach the nations of the earth the Gos- 
pel. God bless you. May He bless us 
all and inspire us to labor for eternal 
lives, and may we be saved and exalt- 
ed in His presence with all the faithful 
men and women who have lived. I ask 
it in the name of Jesus, Amen.

My beloved brethren and sisters, I 
am pleased to meet with you this 
morning, and I trust that I may enjoy 
the Spirit of the Lord during the 
few moments that I may address you, 
as our brethren enjoyed that Spirit 
yesterday. I have no desire to speak 
a word that cannot be heard by every 
soul that is here this morning, and 1 
have no desire to speak a word that 



will not be dictated by the Holy Spirit 
of God. We have learned in our ex- 
perience how easy it is for men to 
speak to the edification of the Latter- 
day Saints and those who are seeking 
the truth when they are inspired by 
the Spirit of Almighty God; but with 
all the oratory and learning of men, 
they are not able to convert those who 
are honest in heart, except they pos- 
sess this Spirit. The men who have 
had the greatest success in converting 
souls to the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints have not been men 
of very great learning; they have been 
men who have been taught of God, 
who have been God-fearing, humblei 
and willing to give unto Him the honor 
and the glory for all they were able to 
accomplish. So I desire this morning 
to possess that same spirit of humility 
and the Spirit of the Lord, that I may 
be able to edify the Latter-day Saints 
for a few moments and to touch upon 
some points that will be for the bene- 
fit of the people in general, or of some 
of us at any rate. 

In the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints there is everything.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



I believe, that is necessary for our 
happiness here upon earth and for our 
salvation in the future. Within its 
organization we can find everything to 
keep our minds occupied, everything 
to instruct us in every labor of life, 
and the Spirit of God to guide us in 
all that we undertake to do. A great 
many ministers who are not of our 
faith have made comments upon the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ, and some of 
them have remarked that all that was 
necessary to thwart our purposes and 
to bring to naught the work that has 
been set on foot by the Lord was to 
show up our principles; yet those who 
make such comments have always been 
of that class that have never under- 
taken to expose any one of our prin- 
ciples, they knowing full well that the 
principles of the Gospel which they 
Iiave investigated are founded upon 
Scriptures and upon the word of God. 
AH the comments that I have ever 
lieard or read that our enemies have 
■ever made upon the doctrines of Jesus 
that they have avoided the direct 
bringing to light of any one of the 
principles in which we believe; but they 
"have made incorrect assertions, they 
liave misrepresented us in various 
ways. This may be because they have 
not thoroughly understood our motives. 

I have in my pocket a slip of paper 
clipped from the Portland Oregonian of 
March 26th, giving the opinion of one 
Mr. Stone, the secretary of the Young 
Men's Christian association. His com- 
ments are very much of the character 
I bave mentioned. He says that the 
Mormons who have been members of 
bis association have not been per- 
mitted to vote or hold office because 
they are not considered as Christians. 
We are excluded from the pale of the 
Christian churches, as they term it, 
and therefore our people have been ex- 
cluded from voting or holding office in 
that assocation. 

I would like to say a few words upon 
this matter, inasmuch as the Latter- 
day Saints are given to joining these 
various associations and societies that 
are not part of the Church of Christ. 
In this city alone we have a great many 
young Latter-day Saints — at least, they 
are the children of Latter-day Saints — 
who belong to these various associa- 
tions. Now, we have no objection to 
people believing as they desire. 



At the same time it is our wish that 
the Latter-day Saints should grow up 
with a knowledge of the Gospel. First 
implant the knowledge of the Gospel 
of Christ within their hearts, and 
then they cannot be contaminated by 
error, if they are true and faithful to 
the principles of that Gospel. In va- 
rious places throughout the Stakes of 
Zion we find that the Latter-day Saints 
have been given to joining secret so> 
cieties as well as other associations. 
This is forbidden by the Priesthood of 
the Son of God. There is all of the 
brotherhood and all of the insurance, 
if you please, contained in the Church 
of Jesus Christ that are necessary for 
us. It is a fact that there are Latter- 
day Saints, in Salt Lake City and else- 
where, who cannot find time to attend 
to their duties in the Priesthood, but 
do find time to attend to their lodge 
meetings. We are running wild in 
this respect. Irreverence for the 
Priesthood of the Son of God is grow- 
ing out of this. Those young men 
who attend lodge meetings and do not 
attend their Priesthood meetings, what 
reverence do they have for the Priest- 
hood of the Son of God? They have 
very little, if any, because they have 
never learned to reverence that Priest- 
hood. 

Our missionaries, whose number has 
been increased some two hundred in 
the world during the last year, have 
also been performing a great work at 
home. One hundred and forty have 
been sent out among the Latter-day 
Saints in the various settlements, to 
bring in the indifferent and those who 
have been negligent in their duties, ana 
to try to get them to take a live in- 
terest in the Gospel of Jesus Christ, 
and to join the various Improvement 
Associations. The effect that this 
corps of missionaries has had upon the 
people in general has been reported as 
being very good. Not only the Toung 
Men's and the Young Ladies' Mutual 
Improvement associations, but the 
various Priesthood meetings have 
been better attended than ever 
before, or for years before, at 
any rate. The Presidents of 
Stakes have reported, in many in- 
stances, that the Sabbath schools 
also have been improved through the 
work of these brethren, and also that 
the people have shown a more liberal

21 



spirit in the payment of their tithes 
and donations. They have received 
a general wakening up in their re- 
ligion. I have ofttimes wondered 
how it is that we could afford to send 
so many missionaries abroad to preach 
the Gospel, and at the same time 
neglect our young men and young 
women here in Zion. When people 
are converted abroad and are brought 
to Zion, they see the example of some 
of the young, and they apostatize on 
account of that. Therefore, it has 
been deemed wise by the brethren to 
send out these missionaries, that they 
might go into the homes of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints and teach them the 
Gospel. We understand that there 
are a great many quorums of the 
Priesthood that have not been able to 
discharge their duties as they should 
have done; the Teachers have not in 
all cases visited the Saints as they 
might have done; the Priests have not 
gone from house to house and ex- 
pounded the Scriptures as it is their 
duty to do; and one of the difficuties 
has been that the members of the 
various quorums have not had any- 
thing to do. Inactivity is death. 
Wherever there is a body of people 
upon the face of the earth that has 
nothing to do, that quorum or body 
will die spiritually. The Spirit of 
God will not be with men who are in- 
active. The Spirit of God is a spirit 
of progression. Therefore, my breth- 
ren and sisters, we can see the neces- 
sity of the work that these mission- 
aries have been performing here at 
home. We cannot deny but that there 
has been great need of this work. 
And they have worked just as zealous- 
ly, for aught I know, and in many 
cases I know they have — as they would 
have done upon foreign missions. If 
we could keep those Elders who have 
returned from missions and the vari- 
ous quorums of the Priesthood at 
work, there would be little 
doubt as to the final outcome of this 
work. We wish to grow at home as 
well as abroad; not simply send our 
Elders abroad to preach the Gospel, 
but also encourage their work here, 
that the people may have their interest 
renewed in the Gospel and every man 
be at work. The organization of the 
Church of Jesus Christ is so complete 



that it reaches every man and every 
woman and every child. 

Some things were spoken upon yes- 
terday of a temporal nature that might 
be taken to heart to good advantage 
by all of the Latter-day Saints. We 
cannot separate our temporal salvation 
from our spiritual salvation. We should 
be a people who believe in enterprise, 
in benefiting each other and sustaining 
each other. There is one thing in. 
connection with this that I would lika 
to mention. There has been too much 
enmity or jealousy among the Latter- 
day Saints in relation to things that 
have been started for the benefit of 
the people. For instance, we go into 
a village and we find a blacksmith or 
a carpenter who has been doing a good 
work and able to earn a fair wage, 
perhaps he has become well off. Then 
our brethren get jealous of that brother 
becaue he is progressing, and the> 
will start up a shop of the same kind 
next door to him, or very near. The 
result is, the profits have to be divid- 
ed, and there is not enough for either 
of them perhaps; whereas, had they 
gone into something else, they would 
have been able to assist in the general 
prosperity. Our people at various times 
get a mill craze. They get a saw- 
mill craze, or a creamery craze, or 
something of that kind; and because of 
their lack of union, they are cutting, 
each other's throat financially. It ap- 
pears to me that there is in the or- 
ganization of the Church of Christ 
everything necessary for our temporal 
salvation as well as for our spiritual 
salvation, and if we would only make 
use of this beautiful organization, it 
would not be as we find it today, our 
people underbidding each other till their 
contracts are let so low in various 
places that they are unable to fill them. 

Only a short time ago I noted in one 
of our valleys, which furnished sup- 
plies for Fort Duchesne, that on ac- 
count of their lack of union in tem- 
poral affairs, they had underbid each 
other until the man who had secured 
the wood contract was unable to fill it, 
and his bondsmen had to do so. So it 
is in relation to the grain, and to the 
flour, and everything that is produced. 
When the stores made these contracts, 
the people got the idea that they were 
making too much money and getting 
rich, so they went in and underbid each 



2 2 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



other on government contracts and got 
them down to such a low figure that 
they could not possibly afford to de- 
liver at the price contracted for. This 
is a suggestion, I believe, that it would 
be well to give consideration in various 
places. We find that mail contracts in 
Utah are contracted for, in many in- 
stances, by men who do not live in the 
State. The last ones that were let were 
awarded to men in Kentucky, and they 
sublet them to our people, who do the 
work for less than what their horses' 
feed will cost them, if their horses 
were fed as they should be. Therefore, 
we do the work and some one else gets 
the money. These matters pertaining 
to our temporal welfare, I believe, 
should be given attention by the 
Presidents of Stakes. We should not 
be jealous of our brethren and sisters 
when we see they are progressing and 
prospering. We desire that they should 
do well. We should desire that not 
only they should do well, but that all 
Israel should do well, that we may be- 
come an independent people, and not 
be the payers of interest, but receive 
interest; that we should have money 
to loan, instead of borrowing and hav- 
ing the shingles mortgaged over our 
wives and children as they are today 
in many cases. 

I pray that the blessings of God may 
rest upon this people, that we may be 
blessed spiritually and temporally; 
that the power of God may be manifest 
in this Conference; that the brethren 
m-y all speak by the power of the Lord; 
that His Spirit may be with each and 
every one of us; that we may take to 
heart the instructions that are given in 
this Conference, and carry them to our 
homes, that this Conference may be 
the means of refreshing us, as our 
Conferences always do, to cause us to 
be a more moral people, a better peo- 
ple in every respect; which may God 
grant, for Christ's sake. Amen. 

ELDER M. F. COWLEY. 

The hand of God in past and current events — The 
missionaries abroad — Mutual improvement work 
—Peace departing from the earth — Repeniance 
needed. 

My brethren and sisters, I desire your 
kind attention, that I may be able to 
make you hear. My voice is not very 
strong, and we are reminded that we 



must talk loud. I also desire your kind 
faith and prayers, that the Spirit of the 
Lord may suggest all that is said. 

The work of the Lord is so broad 
and comprehensive that it meets the 
requirements of the Saints in all con- 
ditions of life and in all places, and it 
is impossible for us to have any meas- 
ured instructions, or anything pre- 
arranged. We are supposed to speak 
and to counsel by the inspiration of the 
Holy Spirit, and every Latter-day 
Saint that assembles in this Confer- 
ence is under obligation to take an ac- 
tive part in the proceedings of the 
Conference, in the way at least of 
having his mind clear and free from 
outside influences, and come here with 
a desire to be instructed and to receive 
the word of the Lord through His ser- 
vants who are called upon to address 
us. 1 have rejoiced in the instructions 
of this Conference thus far. I have a 
testimony in my heart that every 
word which has been spoken and every 
suggestion which has been made is ap- 
propriate. 

I recognize the hand of the Lord in 
the events that are occurring in the 
midst of the Latter-day Saints, and 
also abroad among the nations of the 
earth. It was stated yesterday that 
the Lord had delivered His people 
from every kind of oppression, so far 
as we had gone. To my mind, this is 
a very striking evidence of the divin- 
ity of this work and of the divine 
mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith; 
and He will deliver His people from 
every condition that is not as it should 
be, provided we do our duty. There 
is nothing more important to the Lat- 
ter-day Saints than to understand oui 
individual duty and to perform it 
every day. It is by compliance with 
the simple and plain obligations that 
the Gospel enjoins upon us that we are 
entitled to the inspiration of the Holy 
Spirit to guide us into all truth and 
to establish us against every influence 
that may be brought to bear to destroy 
our faith and to turn us aside from 
the path which leads to eternal life. 

This is the day of the Lord's prepar- 
ation, and the work of preaching the 
Gospel is being accelerated in the na- 
tions of the earth. I have enjoyed 
myself since our last General Confer- 
ence in traveling among the Elders of 
the Southern States, principally, and 



ELDER MAT HI AS Fi COWLEY.

also touching briefly the mission of 
Colorado, of the Northern States at 
Chicago and Cincinnati, and of the 
Eastern States in the city of New- 
York. I have witnessed a good inter- 
est being exhibited by those young 
Elders who are abroad preaching the 
Gospel in those sections of the coun- 
try. And I may say the same of the 
Northwestern States mission, compris- 
ing the states of Oregon, northern 
Idaho and Washington, where I visit- 
ed a few days ago in company with 
Elder John Henry Smith. In all of 
these missions we have found a good 
spirit among the Elders; and I am 
happy to bring this report to the fath- 
ers and mothers of the sons and to 
the wives of their husbands who are 
abroad preaching the Gospel in the 
nations of the earth. The Elders 
usually are contented in their mis- 
sionary fields. They labor under the 
influence of that testimony which 
gives them to understand that their 
mission upon the earth is to preach 
the Gospel, to assist in the gathering 
of Israel and in the establishment of 
the Church and kingdom of God upon 
the earth. But one of the causes 
which lead Elders at times to be 
homesick is the letters which they get 
from their peonle at home. The Lat- 
ter-day Saints should not in this way 
discourage those who do us the honor 
of representing the work of God 
among the nations of the earth. The 
letters that are sent abroad by wives, 
by fathers, by mothers, by brothers, to 
the Elders that are preaching the Gos- 
pel, should be letters of encourage- 
ment, and not discouragement. I la- 
bored with one Elder many years ago, 
in the state of Virginia, who had a 
large family of children. His wife 
was a good Latter-day Saint, with a 
great deal of faith; and whenever she 
had any sickness at home, she kept it 
from the knowledge of her husband 
until the patient was well, and the 
Lord blessed her in so doing. 

I have read in the newspapers of 
late the comments of ten ministers of 
modern Christianity, published in 
Portland, Oregon, where Brother Wil- 
liam Parkinson and his brother were 
preaching the Gospel. Their com- 
ments were on this wise: that the 
Latter-day Saint Elders were preach- 
ing doctrine that was common to 



Christianity, but the distinctive fea- 
tures of Mormonism were kept in the 
background. I want to say that there 
is not a principle in the Gospel that 
we have espoused that is not dis- 
tinctive from the religions of the 
world. There may be a common ac- 
ceptance of the mission of Christ as 
the Redeemer of mankind; but the 
very principle of faith in God and in 
His Son Jesus Christ is exemplified in 
the Elders traveling and preaching 
the Gospel without money and with- 
out price, and the faith which they 
manifest in doing this in the South- 
ern States is a standing rebuke to 
those who preach for money and di- 
vine for hire. People said to Brother 
Lyman and myself, in the Southern 
States and elsewhere, "Why, we could 
not expect that our ministers would 
do as your Elders do, travel and 
preach, going on foot from place to 
place and from house to house, not 
missing the humblest and the poorest 
in the land, without remuneration of a 
financial character." This is the 
principle of faith exhibited in these 
young Elders, and we ought to en- 
courage this principle, and show our 
faith, when we are called upon to car- 
ry the Gospel abroad, by going and 
performing the duty assigned unto us 
to the best of the ability with which 
the Lord shall endow us. The state- 
ment was made by the Lord to the 
Prophet Joseph in the commence- 
ment of this Church, and repeated 
many times in revelations given 
through him to David Whitmer, to 
Oliver Cowdery, to Ziba Peterson, and 
to other men, that the harvest is great 
and the laborers are few. That state- 
ment is true today. Notwithstanding 
the expansion of the Church, and the 
thousands of Seventies whose busi- 
ness it is to carry the Gospel and to 
be especial witnesses of the name of 
Christ in all the world, and the thou- 
sands of Elders from which their ranks 
can be supplied — notwithstanding that, 
the cry of the presidents of the differ- 
ent missions is for more Elders. I be- 
lieve that Brother Kelsch, of the 
Northern States mission, has about 
150 Elders in his mission, and says 
that he could use 500 as well as not. 
The president of the Northwestern 
States mission, Brother Parkinson, 
desires more Elders in that mission; 



24 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



they only have about 18. Brother 
Elias Kimball says that he could use 
in the Southern States 1,000 instead of 
500. I suppose that a similar testi- 
mony could be borne by the presidents 
of the various missions in Europe and 
on the Pacific islands. This should 
inspire us, my brethren and sisters, 
with a desire that our sons shall ac- 
quire a knowledge of the Gospel. 

I am glad to see that while this de- 
mand exists abroad, there is a corres- 
ponding increase of interest at home 
in the Stakes of Zion, which has been 
so encouragingly manifest this past 
winter by the missionary work accom- 
plished by the representatives of the 
Mutual Improvement Associations, 
who have been traveling in the vari- 
ous Stakes of Zion, getting right to 
the hearts of the boys, on the street 
and elsewhere, and endeavoring to 
show them the propriety of taking an 
interest in the Gospel, the necessity of 
laying aside every evil habit, and of 
cultivating in their hearts the spirit 
of purity and of righteousness, that 
they may enjoy the Spirit and power 
of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. I un- 
derstand that many of these young 
men, through their labors, have de- 
veloped a marked talent for mission- 
ary work, in drawing into the fold of 
Mutual Improvement young men who 
had hitherto been indifferent and 
careless in regard to this work. This 
missionary talent should be cultivated, 
developed, and encouraged by the 
Latter-day Saints wherever it exists. 
I believe, through their labors, they 
have added to the Young Men's Mu- 
tual Improvement Assocations through- 
out the Stakes of Zion about thirteen 
thousand members to those that were 
already enrolled. This Is a glorious 
work. I have heard reports of the 
excellent labors of Brother Alphonso 
Snow, who labored in the Oneida 
Stake and in parts of Cache Valley. 
Good reports come from him and his 
associates in that work. I understand 
that the Elders who have labored in 
this Stake and in the southern Stakes 
of Zi>on have also accomplished a good 
work in their efforts among the young 
men. I rejoice in this. I commend 
the young men for their work in the 
cause of Mutual Improvement. 

As I said, the Lord is preparing the 
people. He is also preparing the na- 



tions of the earth. I wish to read a 
passage that comes to my mind be- 
fore I sit down: 

"And again, verily I say unto you, 

inhabitants of the earth, I the Lord 
am willing to make these things 
known unto all flesh." 

That is, the things of the Gospel, the 
revelations of God to the Prophet 
Joseph Smith, the introduction of a 
new dispensation and the authority of 
God establshed upon the earth to call 
men to repentance, and to administer 
by such authority and power that 
when men are baptized in water they 
shall receive the remission of their 
sins, provided they are honest, and 
they shall have the gift of the Holy 
Ghost by the imposition of hands. 
This is the character of the dispensa- 
tion committed unto us in these last 
days. The Lord says, "I am willing 
to make these things known unto all 
flesh." He has been making them 
known for the last sixty-eight years. 
He has been placing the people under 
greater obligations by sending the 
glad tidings of eternal life, and it has 
been, to a great extent, rejected, al- 
though now the barriers that have 
been established and maintained by 
the priestcraft of the world and by 
other influences have, to some extent, 
been broken down, until the Elders 
are reaching the honest in heart and 
bringing many of them to a knowl- 
edge of the truth. The revelation con- 
tinues: 

"For I am no respecter of persons, 
and will that all men shall know that 
the day speedily cometh; the hour is. 
not yet, but is at hand, when peace 
shall be taken from the earth, and 
the devil shall have power over his 
own dominion; 

"And also the Lord shall have power 
over His Saints, and shall reign in 
their midst, and shall come down in 
judgment upon Idumea, or the world." 

Now, peace, to some extent, is being 
taken from the nations of the earth. 
There are rumors of wars in the land. 
There is agitation among the nations 
of the earth. These things have been 
predicted by the prophets of God, and 

1 testify that every prophecy that has 
been uttered by the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, so far as the wheels of time 
have brought it due, has been verified 
to the letter, as much so as any 



ELDER BRIG HAM 10UNG. 



25 



prophecy that was ever uttered by- 
Moses, or by Isaiah, or by any of the 
ancient prophets of the living God. 
War will be poured out upon the na- 
trons of the earth; and it shall come 
to pass among the wicked that every 
man that will not take up his sword 
against his neighbor must needs flee 
unto Zion for safety. There shall be 
gathered unto Zion out of every na- 
tion under heaven, and it shall be the 
only people that shall not be at war 
one with another. If there is anyone 
that doubts the inspiration of the 
Prophet Joseph, I want them to read 
that prophecy, and to remember that 
the day will come when the people on 
this land of Zion will be the only peo- 
ple that shall not be at war one with 
another, and that the day will come 
when those that will not fight against 
their neighbors will take up their 
flight to Zion, that they may find a 
place of safety. This prophecy agrees 
with the prophecy contained in the 
4th chapter of Isaiah and also in the 
13th chapter of Isaiah, where he 
speaks of the judgments of God that 
shall come upon the wicked, and that 
there shall be desolation among the 
children of men, because of their 
pride, their haughtiness, and their 
wickedness. 

Brethren and sisters, judgments be- 
gin at the house of the Lord. Let us, 
therefore, repent of our sins, repent 
of our folly, of our pride, of our hypoc- 
risy, our inconsistency and our self- 
righteousness in sitting in judgment 
upon others, while in our own hearts 
there are faults and in our own eyes 
there are many beams. I rejoice, my 
brethren and sisters, in this work. I 
have a testimony of its truth. I am 
glad to say that we are not idle in 
our ministry; that we rejoice in our 
labors; that we are desirous of being 
a benefit and a blessing to the Latter- 
day Saints, that they may profit by 
the ministration of the servants of 
God. I bear to you my testimony of 
the truth of this work. I bear to my 
young brethren a testimony concern- 
ing this work and the divine mission 
of the Prophet Joseph Smith. To the 
young people especially I say, if you 
will take interest in this work, if you 
will seek unto God, in humble prayer, 
and peruse the Book of Mormon with 
a prayerful heart and these other 



revelations of God, you shall receive 
a testimony of the truth, and you 
shall know for yourselves that this is 
the work of God, and that it has come 
to stay, to extend abroad, and to es- 
tablish itself throughout the nations 
of the earth. May God bless you, in 
the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER BRIGHAM YOUNG. 
The spirit of the world opposed to salvation— The 
spirit of war abroad and of peace in Zion. 

It is a time of rejoicing with the 
Latter-day Saints; for God has been 
merciful unto us as a people and as 
individuals we have been blessed 
and there has been no time in the his- 
tory of the Church when we had 
greater cause to serve the Lord than 
this day. I am aware of the fact 
that there are forces exercised in be- 
half of the Church of Christ, and also 
that opposition is beginning to rear 
itself again more visibly than we have 
experienced for several years. Every- 
thing that has been spoken here in 
this Tabernacle yesterday and to-day 
has full force and is true, according 
to the ideas that I have; and every 
prophecy of God contained in the Book 
of Mormon, the Doctrine and Coven- 
ants and the Bible, and also the oral 
instructions we receive, will be ful- 
filled. God is directing His servants 
in establishing His work upon the 
earth. There are obligations resting 
upon us that other people deride, scoff 
at, and treat as a thing of naught, 
when those very obligations prompt 
us to use our means, our time, and 
every energy of our natures in the 
labor of saving souls. Yet the world 
oppose us in this, and do not love us, 
because the spirit of the world is op- 
posed to salvation, wealthy and 
poor, the high and low, the brethren 
and sisters in this Church are gath- 
ering treasures; they are laying up 
treasures; they are banking with our 
Father and God. No matter who they 
are, the deposits are being made, and 
the books are kept correctly. The 
debit and the credit is there, and we 
cannot escape it. Revelation has been 
given to us and great favors shown, 
for a particular and a distinct pur- 
pose, because God has chosen us out 
of the world, and they do not love us. 
But a work is given unto this people 



26 



GENERAL CONFER EACE. 



designed to benefit every human being 
that has lived or that lives upon the 
earth. It is not confined to the few 
millions that dwell upon the earth to- 
day, but it extends into the spirit 
world. I care not what we say or 
what we do, it will be to our own ex- 
altation or to our own condemnation. 
The night will come when no man 
can work. But the day is given to us 
in which we labor. I find in my im- 
mediate circle of relatives and friends 
that which I witness among the peo- 
ple — a desire to do right. "Oh! I 
want to do good; I want to live my 
religion." But we do not live it. It has 
been said that that lower place is 
paved with good intentions. We do 
not live our religion. Need this peo- 
ple to be beholden to any race of men, 
to capitalists, to business men, to com- 
binations, to trusts, or to any society 
outside of their own limits? No. 
There is a magnificent whole, complete 
in every particular planted in the 
midst of this people, which is unas- 
sailable, only so far as we admit the 
enemy in our hearts. The only vul- 
nerable place in our armor is 
where we ourselves leave it exposed, 
because God has armed us at all 
points. He has made us impervious 
to outside attacks. But when we boil 
Inside, destruction waits upon us. 

What are the signs of the times? 
All people will be at war, save the 
people in Zion. What will preserve 
the people in Zion? When Brother 
Cowley read a portion of that revela- 
tion in relation to this matter, I asked 
myself the question, what will make 
peace in Zion? Is it because we find 
disunion here, because we strew our 
ways to strangers, or are in debt, or 
harassed upon every side, or we yield 
to temptation, or we affiliate with 
those who will turn and rend us? 
Will this bring peace to Zion while all 
shall be at war around us? Oh, no! 
We all know that peace will be here 
because God has given it for the 
righteousness of His people, the union 
of His sons and daughters, to whom 
He has delegated the greatest work 
-ever committed to men upon the earth. 
That is why peace will be in Zion. It 
occurred to me to read a few verses 
from the Book of Mormon in relation 
to this matter. Lehi, speaking to his 
family, says: 



"For, behold, he said, I have seen a 
vision, in which I know that Jerusalem 
is destroyed; and had we remained in 
Jerusalem, we should also have per- 
ished. 

"But, he said, notwithstanding our 
afflictions, we have obtained a land of 
promise, a land which is choice above 
all other lands; a land which the 
Lord God hath covenanted with me 
should be a land for the inheritance 
of my seed. Yea, the Lord hath cov- 
enanted this land unto me, and to my 
children for ever; and also all those 
who should be led out of other coun- 
tries by the hand of the Lord. 

"Wherefore, I, Lehi, prophesy ac- 
cording to the workings of the Spirit 
which is in me, that there shall none 
come into this land, save they shall 
be brought by the hand of the Lord. 

"Wherefore, this land is consecrated 
unto him whom he shall bring. And 
if it so be that they shall serve him 
according to the commandments which 
he hath given, it shall be a land of 
liberty unto them; wherefore, they 
shall never be brought down into cap- 
tivity; if so, it shall be because of 
iniquity; for if iniquity shall abound, 
cursed shall be the land for their sakes; 
but unto the righteous it shall be 
blessed for ever." 

Will these words come true? Do 
we see today the fulfillment of the 
promises of Lehi, a man who led his 
family, under the hand of God, to this 
land which is choice above all other 
lands, for the purpose of establishing 
a people here who should, under the 
providences of God, write these writ- 
ings, deliver these prophecies, hide up 
this volume, to come forth in the lat- 
ter days to a people who should be 
established upon this land, and who 
should bring the Gospel to the seed of 
Lehi and spread it abroad to the na- 
tions of the earth; who should gather 
upon the land of Zion, and have peace 
and joy, though mourning over the 
tribulations of their brethren? Peace 
shall reign in Zion if we are righteous. 
But if iniquity abound here, where is 
peace promised to the Latter-day 
Saints in that event? I know of no 
place or refuge upon the earth that 
will not be affected when iniquity 
abounds in the hearts of the sons of 
our Father. Is that not so? 



ELDER B. H. ROBERTS

"And behold, it is wisdom that this 
land should be kept as yet from the 
knowledge of other nations; for be- 
hold, many nations would overrun the 
land, that there would be no place for 
an inheritance." 

And Lehi goes on to prophesy in re- 
lation to this matter. 

We are threatened with a war. The 
nations of the earth are threatened 
with war. Turmoil and confusion 
are in our own land. We are strewing 
our ways to strangers. Your sons and 
my sons are joining with those who are 
not of our faith, and I testify that it 
is a source of infidelity in the minds 
of those who do these things. God 
will have a people that will serve Him, 
and they will be a righteous people, 
and the land will be blessed; for I 
testify to you this day that Zion will 
be weeded, the iniquitous acts of men 
will bring their own destruction, and 
Zion will be cleansed before this great 
and dreadful day comes when war 
shall be among all nations, and in 
Zion there shall be peace. 

God give us grace to understand the 
signs of the times, and to know that 
we have no time to spare; that the 
time is now when we must prepare 
ourselves, that when those who de- 
sire peace flee unto us they will not 
find us wanting, but the faith and 
power of God will be in the midst ot 
the people, to the salvation of every 
soul that seeks to dwell in peace and 
serve God in an undisturbed manner. 
May grace abound in our hearts, and 
peace be in our homes, in the hearts 
of our wives and children; and may 
we set our faces as a flint to serve 
God with undivided hearts, is my 
prayer in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER B. H. ROBERTS. 

■Great cause for serving the Lord— Righteousness 
brings peace— The war spirit among the nations. 

My brethren and sisters, with you 
I have rejoiced exceedingly in the 
services of this Conference, and my 
heart has been made glad by reason 
of the outpouring of the Spirit of God 
upon His servants. I have felt for 
myself very much encouraged by the 
words that have been spoken, and 
have felt reproved when reproof has 
been administered. I rejoice that 
my spirit has been so far responsive 



to the spirit manifested through our 
brethren who have ministered unto 
us. Great truths have been spoken; 
great testimonies, far reaching in their 
effects in the earth, have been deliv- 
ered; and it does seem to me that the 
voice of warning is being sounded 
through this Conference to the nations 
of the earth. 

While the brethren were speaking 
this morning the following passage in 
the Doctrine and Covenants came very 
forcibly to my mind. It is found in 
the 88th section. The Lord addresses 
the revelation to His servants who 
were engaged in the ministry, and it 
contains instructions to them; and in 
this particular part the Lord said: 

"Abide ye in the liberty wherewith 
ye are made free; entangle not your- 
selves in sin, but let your hands be 
clean, until the Lord come; 

"For not many days hence and the 
earth shall tremble and reel to and 
fro as a drunken man, and the sun 
shall hide his face, and shall refuse 
to give light, and the moon shall be 
bathed in blood and the stars 
shall become exceeding angry, and 
shail cast themselves down as a fig 
that falleth from off a fig tree. 

"And after your testimony cometh 
wrath and indignation upon the peo- 
ple, for after your testimony cometh 
the testimony of earthquakes, that 
shall cause groanings in the midst of 
her, and men shall fall upon the 
ground, and shall not be able to stand. 

"And also cometh the testimony of 
the voice of thunderings, and the 
voice of lightnings, and the voice of 
tempests, and the voice of the waves 
of the sea, heaving themselves beyond 
their bounds. 

"And all things shall be in commo- 
tion; and surely, men's hearts shall 
fail them; for fear shall come upon all 
people." 

This revelation was given in the 
year 1832 — 66 years ago; and has been 
Cod's voice unto the nations of the 
earth. If it was wisdom in Him so 
long ago to place upon record this 
His word, how much more important 
it is, after the lapse of more than half 
a century, that it should be repeated, 
and especially in view of the commo- 
tion that exists among the children of 
men, when great dynasties seem to be

crumbling to pieces, and when nations 
have been arming and equipping them- 
selves for war, and when there is evi- 
dence of the elements being disturbed, 
and when by experience the inhab- 
itants of the earth may know that de- 
structive elements may sweep over 
the land at the will of God. 

I wish to bear testimony to you that 
the testimony of the Spirit of God to 
my heart is that there is a wonderful 
significance in the opening of the way 
for the proclamation of the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ among the nations. The 
Lord hath softened the hearts of the 
children of men, and in fulfillment of 
the prediction of His servant, Presi- 
dent, Prophet, Seer and Revelator of 
the Church of Christ, hath broken 
down the barriers and opened up path- 
ways for the servants of God, that 
they might cry repentance unto this 
generation, and that the warning 
might be sounded in their ears be- 
fore judgment shall be poured out 
upon them. The Lord in this genera- 
tion hath not left Himself without 
witness unto the children of men. He 
has not only given this word that I 
have read to you, for His servants to 
make proclamation of among the in- 
habitants of the earth; but He has 
gathered together a people from every 
land, brought here by the proclamation 
of this warning message, and hath in 
this manner builded a monument of 
warning unto this generation. It seems 
to me that He has taken more pains 
to proclaim unto the present genera- 
tion of men the judgments that are in 
store for them than He did in the days 
of Noah; for if the teachings of Noah 
and the building of an ark were a 
witness unto that generation of tht- 
destruction that was threatened, sure- 
ly the gathering together of this peo- 
ple, together with every temple that 
they have erected, and every mighty 
Conference that they have held, is 
God's witness and voice unto the in- 
habitants of the earth that the con- 
troversy He hath with them is most 
surely to take place. 

I want to bear my testimony to you, 
in connection with my brethren, that 
the Gospel is true; that there is virtue 
and power in the work of God, and 
that my confidence in its accomplish- 
ing that which hath been decreed con- 



cerning it is most supreme. And I 
ould, if I could, join with you all in 
sounding this warning unto the In- 
habitants of the earth, that the hour 
of God's judgment is at hand; and 
He is vindicating His word and hath 
given unto the people due warning 
and an opportunity to repent. I trust 
that He will continue to do so — con- 
tinue to soften the hearts of the chil- 
dren of men and to leave open the 
gateway to their hearts until this work 
of warning shall be thoroughly com- 
pleted to His own great satisfaction. 
I ask it in the name of Jesus. Amen. 
The hymn which begins, 

For the strength of the hills we bless 
Thee, 

Our God, our fathers' God, 

was sung by the choir.

PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF 

Strange personal experiences— Preserved by the 
revelations and power of God — Incidents of a 
remarkable ministry— Great change coming over 
the earth— The work of God progressing. 

[At President Woodruff's request, 
President Cannon read the 1st Section 
of the Book of Doctrine and Cove- 
nants.] 

I want the attention and the prayers 
of the Saints who have assembled 
upon this occasion. I have been sick 
and very weak in my body for a 
month past, and did not feel that I 
would be able to attend this Confer- 
ence till the day before it opened. I 
have been blessed in this respect to 
be with you. I desire to say some 
things to vou, and perhaps some 
strange things, too. I feel disposed to> 
say something about myself, to give 
you a little of the history of my life, 
because of what I may want to say, 



PRESIDEN1 WILFORD WOODRUFF

before I get through, to the rising 
generation of Israel. My remarks may 
be very eccentric to any but Latter- 
day Saints, and to them also, I expect. 

I suppose when I was born the devil 
knew what I should be called to do; 
for there has been from the day I was 
born until the present two powers with 
me — one to kill me, the other to save 
me. I stand before you today a pretty 
sound-looking, for a man ninety-one 
years of age. I stand before you with 
a body in which almost every bone has 
been broken except my back and neck. 
I have had through my life a power af- 
ter me to take my life. When I was 
about three years old I was pushed 
into a caldron of boiling water, which 
had just been taken off the fire. My 
grandmother took me out, and my skin 
all dropped off excepting off my head 
and feet. I was wrapped up for 
months in cotton and oil. That was 
the beginning of my troubles. When 
I was twelve years of age I was 
drowned; at any rate, I lay in thirty 
feet of water long enough to drown 
anyone. After several unsuccessful 
attempts, I was brought up out of the 
water. This was under the Farming- 
ton mill dam. I was just as dead as 
I shall be thirty years hence. I lay on 
my back and saw the sun go out, and 
passed through all the sensations of 
death that any man would in drown- 
ing. After an hour's labor, I was 
brought around to life again. I shall 
not go into the particulars of many of 
these things, but I have passed 
•h what may be termed death a 
number of times in my life. When I 
was 15 years old I was in one of those 
Connecticut blizzards. I walked four 
miles through a wood into the open 
country, and I sought some place 
where I could hide from the storm 
and rest. There was but one house 
within a mile of me — that was the 
poor house, which was about twenty- 
five rods away. The man was moved 
upon to go up in his garret to get some 
pennyroyal to give to a sick woman, 
and he felt led to look out of the win- 
dow. He saw me crawling into the 
hollow of a big tree. He knew what 
the result of that would be better than 
I did. He took his horse and sleigh 
and came to me, and when he got 
there I was asleep, and he preserved 



my life. When I was 14 years old I 
was bit by a mad dog, and ought to 
have died; but I did not. So I contin- 
ued on, until I can say that I have 
broken both of my legs, one twice; 
broken both of my arms, breast bone, 
several ribs, and altogether been 
through a pretty hard experience for 
a man who had to be called to preach 
the Gospel, at least. I was a miller 
by trade. I have been in two water 
wheels under full head of water, and 
I suppose I ought to have been killed 
in either of them, but I was not hurt. 

That preserving power has followed 
me all the way through my life. It 
has been with me upon my missions 
abroad as well as at home. It has 
followed me until the present day, and 
I have been placed in a great many 
strange places. 

I was ordained to dedicate this Salt 
Lake Temple fifty years before it was 
dedicated. I knew I should live to 
dedicate that Temple. I did live to do 
it. I had a great desire in my boyhood 
to receive the Gospel of Christ, to see 
a prophet or somebody that could 
teach me the Gospel of Christ as 
taught by the ancient Apostles and as. 
I read of in the New Testament. 1 
desired this with every sentiment of 
my heart, and on the first Gospel 
sermon I ever heard I was baptized, 
with my oldest brother. I immediate- 
ly went to Kirtland. I was in Zion's 
Camp with the Prophet of God. I saw 
the dealings of God with him. I saw 
the power of God with him. I saw that 
he was a Prophet. What was mani- 
fest to him by the power of God upon 
that mission was of great value to 
me and to all who received his instruc- 
tions. I will refer to one instance. 
A short time before we landed in 
Missouri Joseph called the camp to- 
gether. He there prophesied unto us, 
and told us what lay before us. He 
gave us the reason why chastisement 
was before us. He says: "You con- 
sider me a boy with the rest of you. 
You have not realized my position be- 
fore the Lord. But there is a chas- 
tisement before this camp." He told us 
that this would come upon us because 
he had not been obeyed in his counsels. 
In one hour after we landed in Mis- 
souri and pitched our tents at Mr. 
Burkett s, one man began to fall here,

another there, and in a few moments 
we had a dozen of our camp stretched 
upon blankets with the cholera. The 
Prophet of God, when he saw this, 
felt to smypathize with them, and he 
and Hyrum laid their hands upon 
Brother Carter, the first man that 
was taken sick, but as soon as they 
did it they were seized themselves, 
and they both had to leave the camp. 
He said afterwards: "I told you what 
was coming to pass, and when afflic- 
tion came I stretched out my hand to 
stay it, and I came very near falling 
by it myself." That mission was very 
interesting to me. 

I want to say here that in all my 
life since joining this Church and 
kingdom, notwithstanding these pow- 
ers that have been with me to kill 
me, I have always had the revelations 
of God with me. That is something 
I want to talk about to Israel before 
I get through. The power of God has 
told me what to do and what not to 
do. While the devil has had powei 
to afflict my body very seriously, th?re 
has been a power with me that has 
saved me through it all. And, when- 
ever I have had the Holy Spirit with 
me to tell me what to do, I have had 
to do that. By that I have been 
saved. By listening to that still small 
voice I am here today with you. There 
are two reasons why I am here today. 
When I went back after the pioneer 
journey, President Young said he 
wanted me to take my family and go 
to Boston, and stay there till I could 
gather all the Saints of God in New 
England and Canada and bring them 
to Zion. That was the mission he 
gave me on my return from the pio- 
neer journey to Winter Quarters. I 
went in the spring, as he told me, and 
took my family. We came one even- 
ing to one of the brethren's houses in 
Indiana. Several of us were th-?re. 
Orson Hyde had a team as well as my- 
self. We drove into a long yard. I 
set my carriage within six inches of 
his. I had my wife and children with 
me. I tied my animals to an oak tree 
on the other side of where we camped. 
I went to bed in my carriage. As I 
laid down, the Spirit of the Lord lold 
me to get up and move my carriage. 
1 did not ask the Lord what He 
meant. I did as I was told. The same 



Spirit told me to go and move my 
animals away from that tree. I did 
that. My wife asked me why I did it. 
I told her I did not know. I had not 
been in bed twenty minutes when 
there came a whirlwind and took thai 
oak tree, which had stood there per- 
haps fifty years, split it right through 
the trunk, and it swept through both 
of those fences where my carriage had 
stood. It never touched Brother Hyde's 
carriage, but it would have crushed 
me and my family to the tarth 
if I had not listened to the voice of the 
Spirit. After spending two years and 
a half in New England and Canada, 
getting the Saints out, I started back 
with the last lot, about a hundred, 
from Boston. We landed in Pitts- 
burg at dusk. We were anxious not 
to stay there, but to go on to St. 
Louis. I saw a steamer making steam 
ready to go out. I went to the cap- 
tain and asked him how many passen- 
gers he had. "Three hundred and fif- 
ty." "Could you take another hun- 
dred?" "Yes." I was just about to 
tell him we wanted to go aboard when 
that Spirit said to me, "Don't go 
aboard that steamer, you nor your 
company." All right, said I. I had 
learned something about that still, 
small voice. I did not go aboard that 
steamer, but waited till the next morn- 
ing. In thirty minutes after that 
steamer left, it took fire. It had ropes 
instead of wheel chains, and they could 
not go ashore. It was a dark night, 
and not a soul was saved. If I had 
not obeyed the influence of that moni- 
tor within me, I would have been there 
myself, with the rest of the company. 
The Thirteenth ward would not have; 
had an Atwood for a Bishop; the 
Church would not have had a Leonard 
W. Hardy as Bishop. They were both 
with me, and their families, including 
Brother Samuel Hardy, who is in St. 
George now, upwards of ninety years 
old. I never disobeyed that Spirit 
but once in my life; I did it then 
through the urgency of other persons, 
and it nearly cost me my life. I have 
been acquainted with this Spirit. It 
was not the blow of trumpets noi- 
thunder and lightning; it was the still 
small voice to me. All the way from 
my boyhood I have been governed and 
controlled by that Spirit. My missions

have been by that Spirit of revelation. 
I was told to go to Fox Islands by 
that same still small voice. In the 
time of the great apostasy in Kirtland 
the Spirit of the Lord said to me, "Gel 
you a partner and go to Fox Islands." 
I knew no more what was in Fox 
Islands than what was in Kolob. 1 
went there, however, baptized a hun- 
dred and brought them up to Zion with 
me. It was upon that island where I 
received a letter from Joseph Smith, 
telling me that I was called by revela- 
tion to fill the place of one of the 
Twelve who had fallen. You will see 
it in the Doctrine and Covenants. That 
thing was revealed to me before I re- 
ceived the letter from Joseph Smith, 
but I did not feel disposed to tell it to 
any mortal man, for I knew it was my 
duty to keep such things to myself. 
Through all my life and labors, when- 
ever I have been told to do anything by 
the Spirit of the Lord, I have always 
found it good to do it. I have been 
preserved by that power. That power 
was with me when I went to Hereford- 
shire. I was preaching every night 
with Brother Cordon, and one night we 
held a meeting in the town hall at 
Hanley, in Staffordshire. The Spirit- 
that still small voice — said to me, "This 
is the last meeting you will hold with 
this people for many days." I told the 
congregation so when I got up. They 
were very much astonished, and asked 
me where I was going. I told them I 
did not know. After, I went to ask the 
Lord what he wanted of me, and He 
told me to go to the south. That was 
all the answer I got. I took the stage 
and rode eighty miles south. The first 
man's house I went into was John Ben- 
bow's. I had not been in his house 
fifteen minutes till I understood why 
the Lord had sent me there. There 
was a people broken off from the Wes- 
leyan Methodists, who had banded 
together and called themselves United 
Brethren. They were watching for the 
coming of the Son of Man, watching 
for the Gospel of Christ, as they read of 
it in the New Testament. The first 
thirty days after I got there I brought 
into the Church some two thousand, 
with fifty ministers, and all their 
chapels, licensed according to law, were 
in my hands. There was no blowing 
of trumpets about that. The Spirit of 
the Lord told me to go there, and when 
I got there I saw why I was sent. 



That is, perhaps, enough to 
say about those things. Now, I 
want to say to this congregation, to 
the young men of Israel, to the Elders 
of Israel, to all our missionaries, the 
day has come when the God of heaven 
requires at my hands, as the President 
of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints, to say unto you, it 
is the will of God for you to take this 
course. Get the Spirit of God before 
you go on your missions or anywhere 
else. Get the spirit of revelation with 
you. And when you get that you are 
safe, and you will do exactly what the 
Lord wants you to do. I have felt 
strongly impressed to say that to this 
Conference. What can you do with- 
out revelation? We cannot do the will 
of God and accomplish what is re- 
quired of us without it. We will make 
no mistakes if we pursue that course. 
That spirit is with the Apostles, and 
with the Elders of Israel who are true 
and faithful. The rising generation 
should labor to obtain the Spirit of 
God. Get it within you and it will be 
a continual monitor with you. 

That is one reason, brethren and sis- 
ters, why my life has been preserved. 
I will tell you another reason. Of 
course, this is my own reason for it. 
One reason why I am here is because 
the Lord has chosen the weak things 
of this world to preach the Gospel, to 
do His work, to build up His kingdom. 
I do not think He has ever had a 
weaker instrument on earth to work 
through than myself. The Almighty 
has known that never for a minute 
since I have been a member of this 
Church have I had any power to take 
any honor or glory to myself with re- 
gard to anything that I have been en- 
abled to do in the work of the ministry 
or elsewhere. Why? Because I have 
known it has come from God, and not 
from me. And no other man who has 
engaged in this work has had any pow- 
er of himself. This power has come 
from God unto us, whereby we have 
been enabled to do the work He has re- 
quired at our hands. 

There is a change coming over the 
earth; there is a change coming 
over the Christian world; and It 
is at our door. You read the 
revelations in the Bible, in the Book of 
Mormon and in the Doctrine and Cove- 
nants appertaining to our day and the

generation before the coming of the Son 
of Man. War! Yes; war is one of the 
troubles that belong to the generation 
in which we live. It will come to pass, 
and no power beneath the heavens can 
stay it. Who cannot open their eyes 
and see the change in the things around 
us? Read these revelations — the revela- 
tion just read by Brother Cannon, and 
the others in these books. The God of 
heaven has set His hand to carry out 
these great purposes that you read of. 
They are as sure to come to pass as 
that God lives. There is no power on 
earth, nor beneath the earth, nor any- 
where else, that can stay the fulfill- 
ment of these things. And they are at 
our doors. 

I am anxious that the Latter-day 
Saints shall round up their shoulders 
and bear off the kingdom of God. Many 
in the world have labored to try the 
overthrow Mormonism. They have 
driven our people from their lands. 
They have persecuted and afflicted us. 
They have put some to death, for the 
word of God and testimony of Jesus. 
But they have not thwarted the pur- 
poses of God in any of these things. 
The Lord, in His mercy and wisdom, 
has led this people to these valleys of 
the mountains. It is ordained of God 
that Zion is to be established here. 
Here is the Tabernacle that the 
Prophet spoke of as a covering from 
the storm and the wind, etc. These 
temples are here in fulfillment of 
prophecy. We have four of them in this 
State. President Young was honored 
of God in the establishment of these 
things. He lived long enough to dedi- 
cate the corner stone of this Temple on 
this bk ck, into which the Latter-day 
Saints go and deliver their friends who 
are in the prison house, and attend 
to the ordinances of the house of God 
for them, in fulfillment of the ancient 
Prophets, who spake as they were 
moved upon by the Holy Ghost, to the 
effect that saviors should be raised 
up on Mount Zion in the latter days 
while the kingdom is the Lord's. Zion 
has got to arise. 

"Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O 
earth; and break forth into singing, O 
mountains; for the Lord hath com- 
forted His people, and will have mercy 
upon His afflicted. 

"But Zion said, The Lord hath for- 



saken me, and my Lord hath forgotten 
me. 

"Can a woman forget her suckling 
child, that she should not have com- 
passion on the son of her womb? Yea, 
they may forget, yet will I not forget 
thee. 

"Behold, I have graven thee upon the 
palms of my hands; thy walls are con- 
tinually before me." (Isaiah, 49: 13-16.) 

All that has been spoken concerning 
Ziion will come to pass, and you and I 
today are witnesses of these things. 

We are here for salvation and eter- 
nal life. We are here to obtain those 
great blessings which Saints of God 
In every age of the world have obtained 
when they have obeyed the command- 
ments of God. Shall we fail? No, we 
shall not if we do our duty. The Gospel 
is just as good today as it was in 
the days of the Savior. As to the glor- 
ious blessings of the Gospel of Christ, 
they have been unpopular in almost 
every age of the world. Take Christ 
Himself: where was there a more un- 
popular man than the Savior of the 
world in His day? And His Apostles 
were unpopular. They were put to 
death for the word of God and testi- 
mony of Jesus Christ. Nevertheless, 
Christ was the Son of God; and the 
Saducees, the Pharisees, the Essenes, 
and all the sects that warred against 
Him were cursed and many of them 
were cast down to hell, while He re- 
mains as the Savior of the world, and 
received the honor and the glory which 
His Father had ordained for 
Him. I want our young 
people especiallv to remem- 
ber these things. Those who are going 
upon missions must not neglect them. 
Unless you have the Holy 
Ghost with you when you go out 
to preach the Gospel, you cannot 
do your duty; but when you 
have that you are safe, go where you 
will, and your words will have their 
effect in the hearts of the honest and 
meek of the earth. 

Brethren and sisters, I feel to thank 
God that we are as well off as we are. 
I feet to thank God that we are in the 
position we occupy in these valleys of 
the mountains. Here is a safe place. 
While in the dedication of that Temple 
I saw the judgments of God that were 
about to be poured out upon this gen-

eration. They will come to pass. I 
read the other night of a terrible flood. 
Who ever heard of such a flood in 
America before? These floods, and 
troubles and tribulations are increasing 
in the earth, and they will increase un- 
til this scene is wound up. I pray God 
my Heavenly Father to bless you all, 
to inspire our hearts, that the vision 
of our minds may be open to compre- 
hend the position we are in and the re- 
sponsibility we are under. The eyes of 
all heaven and earth and hell are over 
us. The eyes of the devils are over us. 
They labor for our destruction; but 
they have not power to do it. We are 
in the hands of God. He holds the keys 
of the destinies of the inhabitants of 
the earth, and He will bless the 
righteous, no matter who they are nor 
where they are. I am thankful to 
listen to the teachings that I have 
heard at this Conference from the El- 
ders of Israel. I rejoice in the progress 
that has been made during the past 
year in the Church abroad. There has 
been an addition to the Church that we 
have never met with in any other year 
since the organization of this Church. 
And here at home there has been a 
great addition. Our sisters have labored 
faithfully in the Primary Associations, 
in the Mutuallmprovement associations, 
and in every capacity in which they 
are called to labor. The blessings of 
God are with them, and they are doing 
much good. The Sunday schools have 
also added to their numbers. They 
have now over one hundred thousand 
members. The Young Men's Mutual 
Improvement Associations, as has been 
said, have an addition of about 
thirteen thousand as a result of their 
labors the past year. God is blessing 
those who labor among them. If you 
can save a soul from death, what bless- 
ings you will have with that soul. As 
the Lord said to Oliver Cowdery, "If 
it so be that you should labor all your 
days in crying repentance unto this 
people, and bring, save it be one soul 
unto me, how great shall be your joy 
with him in the kingdom of my 
Father." We should continue in this 
labor, that we may gain the salvation 
of the souls of men. Inasmuch as you 
will do this, the blessings of God will 
attend you. Zion has got to arise or 
fall. Which shall it be? The 
proclamation of the Gospel of Christ 



is in favor of Zion. All the revelation* 
appertaining to thiB day are in favor 
of Zion, and of preparing the way for 
the coming of the Son of Man. And 
Zion will arise and shine. 

God bless you, one and all. Let us 
do our duty and seek to magnify our 
religion, that when we get through we 
will rejoice in that. It is better to be 
on the Lord's side than anywhere else. 
I want salvation. I want to meet my 
forefathers and my friends whom I 
have labored here to redeem, who 
never heard the Gospel in their day 
and generation. God has given us this 
privilege. We have Elders of Israel 
laboring in all these temples day by 
day for the salvation of the children 
of men. We have been blessed in this 
labor, and we will continue to be 
blessed; and when we get on the other 
side of the veil there is not one of us- 
but will rejoice for the good we have 
done. May God bless you. I feel to 
bless the Latter-day Saints, as far as 
I have power to bless. Our daughters 
and our mothers are laboring for the 
salvation of Israel in their line, and sc- 
are the Elders of Israel in their line. 
But we want to increase and continue 
to increase, until we have power in 
the earth to gather up all the honest 
and meek of the earth. God bless, 
guide and direct us all in the path of 
' truth and righteousness, for Jesus' 
sake. Amen. 

At the conclusion of his remarks 
the vast congregation arose en masse 
and in unison with the choir, sang: 
We thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet, 

To guide us in these latter days. 

PRESIDENT GEORGE Q. CANNON. 

Providential preservation of President Wrodruff — 
The Church controlled by the power of God — He 
vindicates His servants — Trouble results from 
disunion — Selfishness defeats Itself — The Church 
will be cleansed. 

The instructions that we have heard 
during this Conference have been ac- 
companied by the testimony of the 
Spirit of God, and I esteem it as a 
great privilege that we have had this 
afternoon of listening to the testimony 
of President Woodruff. If we have not 
all heard that which he has said, we 
shall have the opportunity of reading; 
it. I think it ought to be esteemed as 
a great pleasure and satisfaction for 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



the Latter-day Saints to hear his 
testimony. President Woodruff is the 
only surviving Apostle who held the 
Apostleship at the time the Prophet 
Joseph lived. He is the only man 
living who received his endowments 
at the hands of the Prophet Joseph. 
He is the only Apostle living who en- 
tered this valley when it was pene- 
trated by the Pioneers. To have him 
survive as long as he has, and to 
stand as a witness in the midst of this 
people, is a great boon to the Church. 
There has been, without doubt, a 
providence in his preservation. The 
Lord has had a purpose to accomplish. 
His testimony, which has so often been 
borne and listened to by the members 
of this Church will have a lasting im- 
pression and influence upon the 
Church. I am, therefore, for one, 
greatly pleased to hear him once more 
address a congregation so large as 
this at our General Conference. If we 
had been asked years ago as to who 
would be likely of the Apostles to sur- 
vive until now, we perhaps would not 
have selected President Woodruff, be- 
cause he was a man advanced in years, 
and, as he has related to us today, had 
passed through so many scenes of 
trial and had labored so hard physi- 
cally, and had so many narrow escapes 
for his life, that it seemed almost im- 
possible that he would survive all the 
others. But, as he has told us, up- 
wards of fifty years ago, while in 
Boston on a mission, the Lord re- 
vealed to him concerning this Temple. 

He has not related that which I 
have heard him speak of at other 
times. There was a discussion con- 
cerning the material of which this 
Temple should be built. Some of the 
brethren advocated one material, and 
some another; and it looked as though 
it would not be built of granite. But 
President Woodruff had seen it in 
granite, and he knew while this dis- 
cussion was in progress that when 
the Temple was built it would be built 
of that material. He also had dreams 
before the Temple was finished con- 
cerning the duty that had been as- 
signed to him. The keys of the Temple 
had been given to him by President 
Young, and he was told to open the 
Temple, so that the people might go 
in. 



Under all the circumstances, has 
there not been a providence in this? 
Our God does not permit things of 
this importance to happen haphazard, 
and without His overruling power 
and providence being manifested. He 
has selected His servants, and He hae. 
assigned them their labors; and He 
will preserve them from accidents and 
from death until they shall accom- 
plish that which they have been sent 
to perform— to fulfill the mission that 
has been given unto them. There is 
no such thing as accident in these 
matters. It is not by chance that these 
occurrences happen; but there is a 
providence which the Lord exercises 
over His people and over the affairs 
of His Church, and over all things 
that happen. They are controlled by 
His power for the accomplishment of 
His purposes. He gives unto us our 
agency, and that agency we can exer- 
cise to the fullest extent. There is no 
limit placed upon it. It is contrary to 
His mind and will and to the plan ot 
salvation that there should be a limit 
placed upon man's agency or upon its 
exercise. But He controls the results. 
As President Young so often told us, 
He controls affairs so as to bring to 
pass His purposes and His designs; 
and there is no power that can prevail 
against Him and the fulfillment of His 
purposes. He supplements man's 
weakness, man's shortsightedness and 
man's inability by His strength, fore- 
knowledge and almighty power. These 
men whom He has chosen to be His 
Apostles are weak, fallible men. 

As President Woodruff has told us, 
the Lord has chosen the weak things 
of the world, that they might not 
glory in themselves nor in their own 
strength; and the man that does 
claim the glory takes steps to destroy 
his influence and to lose his power 
and gifts. . The Lord will not bless> 
men who seek to take the glory to 
themselves. These men are fallible, 
and subject to all the infirmities of 
human nature; but God has chosen 
them, and when they do the best they 
can, seeking to Him for His Spirit, He 
inspires them; and where they come 
short He makes it up by His blessing. 
That which would seem to the natural 
eye to be a mistaken course or polic> 
He overrules and controls for His 



PRESIDENT GEORGE Q. CANNON. 



35 



glory. That has been the course in 
this Church from the beginning. The 
men that have instructed the people, 
from Joseph himself down through all 
the ranks of the Priesthood, have been 
fallible men; their judgment has been 
imperfect; their conclusions have per- 
haps not always been as they should 
have been; but if they have acted ac- 
cording to the light they had and the 
Spirit that God has given them, and 
they have sought the Lord for His 
blessing and guidance, then He takes 
charge after that and He brings to 
pass according to His own good will 
and pleasure, and His power and wis- 
.dom are manifested in that which 
takes place, so that we are perfectly 
fe. If it were not for this, we would 
be appalled at the responsibility that 
rests upon us. Any man who feels 
the weight of responsibility and thinks 
of the dreadful consequences that 
might attend a misstep, could not en- 
dure it if there were not something 
behind him to sustain and buoy him 
up. President Woodruff could not 
stand under the pressure of the re- 
sponsibility upon him, neither could 
any other man who may be near him 
or connected with the Apostleship and 
the Priesthood. 

But there is this reflection all the 
time: God can be trusted. God will 
see to it that His servants are not put 
to shame; that they do not become a 
spectacle in the midst of the people — 
before the Saints or before the world. 
He has never left His servants at any 
time. God be thanked this day for 
this! He has never allowed them to 
be covered with shame and confusion 
through failure. But He has sustained 
them, and He has borne them off vic- 
torious, under all circumstances, when 
they have served Him and appealed 
to His Holy Spirit to guide them. 
And He will do it from this time forth 
until the Lord Himself comes to reign 
on the earth. This will be the result 
if we continue to serve Him. Hence 
it is that the people are required by 
the Lord — with these evidences before 
them of what God has done and the 
predictions that have been fulfilled — 
to listen to the voice of His servants, 
to accept their counsels, to seek for 
His word through them, because He 
has given them power and the author- 



ity, standing in His stead in the midst 
of the people, with the full weight of 
responsibility upon them. Let me ask 
tins congregation, can you put your 
finger on a time when the people of 
this Church have listened to the coun- 
sel of the servants of God that they 
have had reason to repent of it? Tou 
all know that no such thing has ever 
occurred. In every instance, in the 
deepest peril, under the most trying 
and dark circumstances, when the peo- 
ple have listened to counsel God has 
delivered them and brought them 
through safely. This you all know. 
Hence it is that God designs and de- 
sires that His Saints shall listen to 
the voice of revelation, to the voice of 
His Prophet, to the voice of men 
whom He has called to act in His 
stead in the midst of the people. And 
great condemnation will fall upon 
those who do not do this. 

Of all people upon the face of the 
earth we should be the most united. 
In union is our strength. But we are 
not united as we should be. And it 
is this that brings trouble to us. The 
disunion of the people is the source of 
all our trouble. The Lord desires to 
have us a united people, the people 
that will listen to His voice. And 
what does this mean? Does it mean 
tyranny? Does it mean oppression? 
Does it mean the taking away of any 
human being's rights? Does it en- 
croach upon the liberty of any soul? 
No, it does not. It never has. Tt 
never will, because the Priesthood of 
the Son of God is not a tyrant. The 
operations of that Priesthood are 
beneficent under all circumstances. 
Look at the prosperity of this people. 
See how God has blessed them when 
they have listened to counsel and been 
guided aright. All our prosperity is 
traceable to this. Our misfortunes are 
traceable to our disobedience and neg- 
lect. Everyone knows this that has 
any faith whatever in the work of 
God. There is nothing asked of any 
man that he cannot do with the ut- 
most pleasure and with the freest ex- 
ercise of his agency. It has been so 
from the beginning, and it will be so to 
the end. 

We were told this morning, by 
Brother A. O. Woodruff, of the division 
there is among the people in many 



3« 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



directions. It is a pitiable sight that 
among the Latter-day Saints there 
should be such things, such division, 
such selfishness, such injury done by 
one to another. It is wrong, and we 
should avoid it. It is contrary to the 
will of God that we should be in this 
condition. We grieve His Holy Spirit 
when we yield to this spirit that di- 
vides us and arrays us one against 
another. "We ought to understand that 
selfishness defeats itself; that God will 
bless men who love His work and love 
their fellow men, and who do not al- 
low selfishness to predominate in their 
hearts. That has to be extinguished 
among • the Latter-day Saints, if we 
ever would be the people that God has 
said we shall be. I believe the Lord 
will weed out from our midst all who 
contribute to this division among the 
people of God and who will not dis- 
miss these evil influences. Unless we 
are a united people we will not pros- 
per temporally; we cannot prosper 
spiritually. We must love the Lord 
with all our heart, and we must love 
our brethren as we do ourselves. If 
we do not attain to that we cannot 
reach the standard He has raised for 
us. I do not expect that any of us will 
get into the celestial kingdom until we 
have this Spirit and are imbued with 
it and carry it out literally in all our 
associations and dealings with our 
fellow men— until, in fact, we shall be 
a united people, living in the United 
Order, which must be established be- 
fore the reign of righteousness can be 
ushered in. 

We come to these General Confer- 
ences to be instructed in these prin- 
ciples, to have our minds refreshed, 
to hear the testimony of the servants 
of God, and we ought to go away im- 
pressed with these principles, and 
profiting by them sufficiently that we 
will make them a part of our lives. 
We have been called as Latter-day 
Saints. By the miraculous power of 
God we have been gathered from the 
nations of the earth. It is the greatest 
miracle, it may be said, that ever was 
seen by the human family. It is stu- 
pendous. It is something unexampled 
in the history of our race. And there 
is a grand purpose in it, which God 
has revealed. He is gathering from 
the nations of the earth the elements 
that are necessary to lay the founda- 
tion for a new era, to prepare the way 
for the coming of the Lord, for the 
establishment of the reign of righteous- 



ness. Yet, notwithstanding, the na- 
tions behold it, Satan darkens their 
eyes so that they cannot see its grand 
import. But to us the Lord has re- 
vealed this. And there is this remark- 
able fact connected with this: almost 
every man and woman that comes 
from the nations has, himself and her- 
self, received a testimony that they 
ought to do this. They have done it 
under a divine impulse; not by any 
human force that has been brought to 
bear upon them, but by an inward 
force that has appealed to their souls, 
coming to them irresistibly from God. 
These elements are being gathered 
from the nations of the earth in this 
miraculous manner to accomplish the 
purposes of our God. But there will 
be a cleansing in the floor— in the gar- 
ner, as it were. The work of cleansing 
is now going on. The net gathers a 
great many kinds of fish; but the bad 
fish will be thrown out. Having re- 
ceived these testimonies, and being in 
a position to know for ourselves con- 
cerning the work of God, it is for us 
to square our lives to make them agree 
with the principles of righteousness. 
As was read this afternoon, "My Spirit 
shall not always strive with man, saith 
the Lord of hosts." There never has 
been a time in this Church since it3 
organization when the Latter-day 
Saints have been preached to with 
such diligence as they have been of 
late. The Twelve Apostles are travel- 
ing constantly, visiting conferences, 
and the other brethren that are active- 
ly engaged in the ministry are doing 
the same. The people are being 
warned and taught, it seems to me, 
with a diligence and with a faith and 
power that I have never seen before 
in the Church. I do not think the 
Church ever was preached to as it is 
being preached to now. And this can- 
not be done without condemnation fol- 
lowing those who resist the influence 
of the Spirit of God, and who harden 
their hearts against the teachings of 
God's servants. 

God help us, brethren and sisters, to 
be faithful to the truth, to cling to it, 
to love the Lord with all our hearts, 
to serve Him with all the diligence we 
can; which I humbly ask in the name 
of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

The choir sang the anthem.

Young. 



THIRD DAY. 



April 8th, 10 a.m. 
The choir and congregation sang: 

Redeemer of Israel, 

Our only delight, 
On whom for a blessing we call, 
Our shadow by day, 

And our pillar by night, 
Our King, our Deliv'rer, our All! 

Prayer by Elder John W. Hess. 
The hymn which begins, 

Zion stands with hills surrounded — 

Zion kept by power divine, 
was sung by the choir. 

ELDER M. W. MERRILL. 

The Path of Duty Leads to Prosperity— Need for 
Retrenchment — Future Expansion of Missionary 
Work. 

It is always a little difficult for me 
to start out upon a high key, and I 
have discovered that it is more or less 
the case with others. However, if you 
will give me your attention and your 
prayers and faith, I hope to be able to 
make you all hear the few minutes I 
shall occupy your attention. I have 
been much interested in our Confer- 
ence, and can say that I heartily en- 
dorse the remarks that have thus far 
been made in our hearing. I was very 
much interested in the remarks of our 
President on yesterday, though it is not 
very pleasant to contemplate the scenes 
that he has passed through; the 
troubles and ordeals, going through 
waterwheels, having bones broken and 
all this; and I conclude that Very few 
people could, under such circum- 
stances, endure for a long time. 

I have a testimony of this work. I 
know it is true. I know the Lord is 
with His people; the manifestations of 
His power are realized and felt 
by many of the Latter-day Saints. Of 
all people we have the most reason to 
be grateful and thankful to our 
Heaveny Father. While, perhaps, our 
financial condition as a body is not so 
desirable as we would like it, yet I 
believe that we are as well off financial- 
ly, and perhaps better off, than people 
in other states of our Union. It is won- 
derful to me, when I contemplate the 
affairs of our people, to realize the 
vast amount of money that goes from 
us in the transportation and support of 
our Elders on missions abroad, and in 



the payment of our tithes and our of- 
ferings. This is a condition that many 
people do not realize, and they do not 
have to cope with these things. The 
Lord, however, requires these conditions 
at our hands, and apparently He opens 
up the way and provides the means 
whereby these things are accomplished. 
The Elders are sent out, their 
fares are paid, they are supported 
by their friends while abroad; and it 
all costs money, and the money ooraes 
from somewhere. The Lord through 
His providences opens up the way 
whereby these things are accom- 
plished. I was conversing with a 
brother some three or four years ago, 
I think at the Conference in this city, 
and he was telling me his condition. 
He was very much depressed finan- 
cially. He had been under the neces- 
sity (he thought) to mortgage his 
home, and he was very much embar- 
rassed. He felt very bad over it, so 
much so that he could hardly enjoy 
the Spirit of the Conference. He was 
a very intimate friend of mine, and 
he asked me what to do. I told him 
that I believed that I could tell him 
what to do to extricate himself. He 
said he would be very glad to know 
what to do that he might be free 
again. I said, "have you paid your 
tithing of late years?" "Well," he 
said, "no, not so strictly as I ought to 
have done." I told him I thought that 
was one cause of his financial trouble. 
I said to him, "you go home now, and 
pay your tithing strictly, as you re- 
ceive it; don't you sign any more 
notes to anybody; don't give mort- 
gages on any more of your property; 
curtail your expenses at home, re- 
trench a little, for I believe there is 
room for retrenchment; pay your 
tithing; trust in the Lord, and ways 
will be opened up whereby you may 
extricate yourself." I met him at this 
Conference, and he said that he wa3 
getting along finely. He has near.'y 
all of his debts paid, and he has lift- 
ed the mortgage from his homo. I 
said, "then you have paid your tith- 
ing, have you?" He said, "yes, paid 
my tithing strictly and honestly." 
I believe there is a principle in this.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



It is said that Paul may plant and 
Apollos may water, but the Lord gl\- 
eth the increase. And I have conclud- 
ed from my experience that the Lord 
is able to. The Lord gives us the 
increase. He blesses some people 
abundantly for a wise purpose in 
Himself. We cannot always compre- 
hend why he blesses some men above 
other men, but there is a purpose in 
it, and I am just as confident as I am 
that I am standing before you, that 
if the Latter-day Saints from this very 
day, will pay their tithes honestly and 
strictly, and cease to mortgage their 
homes, cease to incur obligations as 
individuals, and begin a system of re- 
trenchment in all their homes, the 
Lord will prosper them and they will 
be free from debt — for is there a fam- 
ily in Israel that cannot retrench a 
little? I know that it can be done; and 
if the Latter-day Saints will do these 
things as a people, the time is not far 
distant when we will be relieved from 
our financial troubles. The Church 
will also be relieved of its financial 
troubles. Why is the Church finan- 
cially depressed? Because we are 
financially depressed. We are the 
Church— the people of the Church, and 
if we will retrench and observe the 
rules of propriety in regard to our 
family affairs I believe that we all 
may be relieved; and I believe the 
time is not far distant when it may be 
said of the Latter-day Saints, that 
they are lenders of money and not bor- 
rowers. This should be our situation. 
Now the evidence is before the people 
that we come far short of what the 
Lord requires at our hands in tithes 
and offerings. I heard President 
Young once say in the old Tabernacle 
here, "if the Latter-day Saints will 
pay their tithes honestly, every man 
and every family, I will pay all their 
taxes, their school bills and their gen- 
eral expenses." It is evident that the 
people did not do it. We may search 
the Church from one end to the other, 
we mav search the records, and we 
will find that there are not many men, 
(of course there are some, and perhaps 
a good number) that pay their tithing 
in full. A large majority of the people, 
I believe, come short in this, and they 
think they are doing pretty well too. 
They make themselves think they are 



doing pretty well in paying their tithes 
and offerings. This principle of tith- 
ing was not instituted by man. The 
authorities of the Church have not in- 
stituted it, God revealed it in the 
early history of the Church, and He 
made it a requirement of the Latter- 
day Saints. It is a law of the Lord, 
-nd it is important that the Latter-day 
Saints live up to the law, that this 
land may be a land of Zion unto the 
people. 

Brethren and sisters, I want to make 
you a promise in my own name, that 
if you will observe these things, begin 
now to pay your tithes and your 
offerings in full, if you will cease to 
sign notes, if you will cease to give 
mortgages on your homes, and re- 
trench from this time forth, and turn 
to the Lord with full purpose of heart, 
I will promise you that the way will 
be opened up and every faithful man 
and woman will be able to extricate 
himself and herself, and the time will 
be in your life time, when you will be 
a free people. There are some few peo- 
ple that are free now, and they do not 
owe any man anything, and they are 
happy and contented; but too many of 
the people have mortgages on their 
homes. I have always raised my voice 
against mortgaging and obligating 
ourselves. Wait until we have the 
means and then make the purchase, 
and do not make the purchase until 
we have the means. Do you not know 
that the whole system of our banking 
institutions in our midst is based upon 
the interest paid by the people for 
money borrowed? It is not a good 
thing, in my view, for individuals to 
do. It may be justifiable in the case 
of some large enterprise that would 
benefit the country and people, but as 
a rule for individuals to pattern after 
large corporations, they will fail if 
they do it. How many people in Salt 
Lake City, and in the country, have 
lost their homes, their families turned 
out without a shelter over their heads, 
because, peradventure, they have been 
unwise! They thought they were go- 
ing to make a great deal of money by 
some speculation, and they have failed. 
The Lord did not bless the enterprise, 
and unless the Lord does so we will 
fail every time; no matter whether it 
be Jews or Gentiles, or Latter-day 



ELDER MARRJNER MERRILL.

Saints, that enter into it. But if the 
Lord will bless the enterprise it will 
be a success. As a rule, however, it 
has not been the counsel of the 
Priesthood, so far as I have learned, 
for the people to obligate themselves 
beyond that which they were able to 
meet at any time. 

This system of retrenchment is im- 
portant and necessary. Not only here 
in the city, but everywhere through- 
out the country, we see extravagance 
among the Saints, and carelessness 
and indifference with regard to the 
things that the Lord blesses us with. 
There is extravagance in the house- 
hold; there is not that care and at- 
tention bestowed that ought to be. 
You will excuse me if I talk about 
myself and my own family, but I am 
reminded of an incident that occurred 
with me a few years ago. I had a 
brother who emigrated from England, 
working at my place. He had left his 
family there and had not the means 
to get them out. He said to me one 
day, "I wish my family could go to 
your swill barrel; they would get 
plenty of food right from it to supply 
them." It set me to thinking. Do 
my family waste things like that? Do 
they waste provisions to such an ex- 
tent that this man and his family 
could live out of the swill barrel? I 
began to examine the matter a little, 
and I had to talk a little about it. I 
not only found it was profitable to 
talk at home, but also to talk among 
my friends and neighbors. There ha& 
been more or less of extravagances 
financially; it is very important that 
nothing should be wasted. President 
Young used to talk about these things 
everywhere he went. I have heard hliu 
in the settlements of Saints caution- 
ing the people to be prudent, and to be 
careful with the means that the Lord 
had blessed them with. I believe we 
ought to observe this counsel, and if 
we will do it, as I said before, I think 
we may rely upon it that the Lord will 
open up our way whereby we may be 
relieved. President Cannon was al- 
most on the point of saying so, the 
other day. I felt the spirit that he 
was possessed of, that he felt to prom- 
ise the people that the time would 
come when we would be in a different 
condition. 



We are trying to do the Lord's 
work, to preach the Gospel to the 
world. We are sending out a few mis- 
sionaries, but, I tell you, so far as i 
can see in the future, and understand 
the future, we are not sending out a 
drop in the bucket today, to what we 
will send out in the future. Only 
think of it for a moment. We have, 
it is said, 1,700 Elders abroad in the 
world. Take these 1,700 Elders, cut 
them in two, place half in London and 
half in New York, two of the great 
cities of the world, and the people of 
these cities would hardly know there 
was an Elder among them, because the 
inhabitants are so numerous. But we 
are doing the best we can in regard 
to this matter, and the work is in- 
creasing and progressing and spread- 
ing abroad, and the Gospel of the 
Kingdom will eventually be preached 
as a witness to all people and all na- 
tions. We are here to do that, ana 
we want to train our sons and prepare 
them to be honorable representatives 
of the Latter-day Saints. We do not 
want to send men out that are not 
honorable men. We want young men 
to go imbued with the spirit of this 
work, and we would like them to have 
a testimony from the Lord before they 
so and be able to give a reason for the 
hope they have within them. Then 
when they go into their fields of labor 
they are prepared to at once take 
hold of the work. They go to teach 
the world; they do not go to be taugh* 
by the world. They go from Zion 
blessed under the hands of the ser- 
vants of God, to teach the Gospel and 
to warn the world. Young men must 
remember that they are not sent abroad 
to be taught of the world, but we 
must be acquainted with some of the 
principles and doctrines of the Church, 
in order to set before the people thosw 
principles and doctrines that God has 
revealed for the salvation and redemp- 
tion of the human family. 

Brethren and sisters, I desire that we 
may reflect upon all these things and 
consider our affairs. We are here in 
this General Conference from the 
different parts of the State and from 
the states surrounding us. We are 
here to be taught; to have our minds 
stirred up by way of remembrance of 
the duties and responsibilities that rest 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



upon us as Latter-day Saints. We are 
a peculiar people— that peculiar peo- 
ple which Isaiah spoke of, and we are 
here to learn the way of the Lord. 
Whether this teaching be temporal or 
whether it be spiritual it is all the 
same for us in the advancement of 
this work. We have to be engaged in 
temporal affairs as well as in spiritual 
affairs to bring about the consumma- 
tion of God's purposes in the earth. 

I pray that the blessings of God may 
be upon Zion, and upon her Stakes, 
that the spirit of humility may possess 
our souls; that we may have an op- 
portunity to be taught, to be instruct- 
ed and to follow in the counsels of the 
Priesthood of the Son of God; then 
we are safe, we are upon the sure 
foundation; our house is founded upon 
the rock, and when the winds come and 
the rains beat upon it, it will stand 
unmoved; but if we are tossed to and 
fro by every wind of doctrine, and 
follow after "Christian Science" or 
some other myth or folly, we shall not 
be saved. As one of the brethren 
we have all in the Church of 
Christ that will exalt and ennoble us. 
Our insurance agencies in the Church 
are safe and sure, and if we are faith- 
ful in keeping the commandments of 
God we will be sure of eternal lives. 
God bless you. Amen. 

ELDER JOHN W. TAYLOR. 

A field of usefullness for women — Divine agen. 
cies at work. 

My brethren and sisters, I pray that 
the Spirit of the Lord which guides us 
in the ways of all truth will direct 
me in what I shall say this morning. 
I bear testimony to the advice that 
has been given unto us by Elder Mer- 
rill. I was pleased with the remarks 
that were given on the first day of this 
Conference, because they partook ot 
the spirit of encouragement. I feel 
encouraged in the work of the Lord, 
and I can see that the spirit which 
the brethren are imbued with is sim- 
ilar to that which was possessed by 
Nephi, the Prophet, while going up 
to the city of Jerusalem to get the rec- 
ord of his forefathers. His brothers 
protested against him going for this 
purpose, and he answered them in this 
wise: 



"That as the Lord liveth, and as we 
live, we will not go down unto out 
father in the wilderness, until we have 
accomplished the thing which the 
Lord hath commanded us." 

When I heard President Cannon 
speaking about the success of the work 
of the Lord I could see he partook of 
the same spirit, and the brethren that 
have followed him since the first day 
have also manifested that spirit. 1 
have been considerably impressed by 
all the remarks that have been made, 
and I feel that any one who has not 
been melted and made tender and pli- 
able by that which has been said, 
must be as -"old as an iceberg. 

I desire to touch upon the idea pre- 
sented by President Cannon, that oc- 
casionally wise and prudent women 
would be permitted to go forth and 
accompany their husbands in preach- 
ing the Gospel to the nations of the 
earth. I have been away on mission- 
ary labor, more or less, for some 
months past; our experience is, espe- 
cially during the pleasant warm weath- 
er, that about one-half of the men in 
the country are away to the mines, 
they are absent from home looking af- 
ter their business, and it would be im- 
prudent for us to teach men's wives, 
and to take them into the waters of 
baptism without the consent of then 
husbands. A great number of men 
in the Western States and territories 
are away from home, and leave their 
wives for a season. It would not be 
wise for Elders to enter such homes, 
in fact, they are advised against this 
and they observe this counsel. The> 
do not go to the homes of women 
where the husbands are absent, or 
where there are no men folks living 
in the house. What is the result? The 
result is there are thousands of fami- 
lies to whom we cannot explain our 
views, simply because there are no 
men at home; they probably would re- 
ceive us with pleasure and listen to 
our message if it were practicable to 
visit them. But I can see now the 
possibility of this being corrected. I 
have in view now, one of the sisters 
that was laboring in the state of Colo- 
rado. In the district where she re- 
sided there were some five families 
where the husbands were away from 
home. She became acquainted with 



ELDER JOHN W TAYLOR. 



4i 



those families. She distributed tracts, 
in their midst, and they came to un- 
derstand our views in regard to our 
religion, but so far as the Elders 
are concerned these families would 
have been passed by. There are 
probably thousands of families in this 
condition. I iust mention this to cor- 
roborate the remarks of President 
Cannon, and to bear testimony to the 
good work that women can do. 

I feel to rejoice in the work in which 
we are engaged and in hearing of the 
great success of the Elders of Israel 
abroad. I was struck very much with 
a remark made yesterday by Elder 
Roberts; it was a very slight remark, 
but it impressed me. He said that 
God had witnesses upon the earth of 
His work. The witnesses Elder Rob- 
erts referred to, I presume, were the 
Elders of Israel who hold the Priest- 
hood and have the testimony of Jesus 
Christ. I desire to read to you about 
other witnesses which possibly he did 
not have in his mind. I find in the 
28th chapter of the Third Book of 
Nephi. the following, spoken by Jesus 
Christ unto the Twelve Apostles upon 
this continent: 

"And it came to pass when Jesus had 
said these words, he spake unto his 
disciples, one by one, saying unto 
them, What is it that ye desire of me, 
after that I am gone to the Father? 

"And they all spake, save it were 
three, we desire that after we have 
lived unto the age of man, that our 
ministry, wherein thou hast called us, 
may have an end, that we may speedi- 
ly come unto thee, in thy kingdom. 

"And He said unto them, Blessed are 
ye, because ye desired this thing of 
me; therefore after that ye are seven- 
ty and two years old, ye shall come 
unto me in my kingdom, and with me 
ye shall find rest. 

"And when He had spoken unto them, 
he turned himself unto the three, and 
said unto them, What will ye that 1 
should do unto you, when I am gone 
unto the Father? 

"And they sorrowed in their hearts, 
for they durst not speak unto Him the 
thing which they desired. 

"And he said unto them, Behold, 1 
know your thoughts, and ye have de- 
sired the thing which John, my be- 
loved, who was with me in my minis- 



try, before that I was lifted up ;>y 
the Jews, desired of me; 

"Therefore more blessed are ye, for 
ye shall never taste of death, but ye 
shall live to behold all the doings of 
the Father, unto the children of men, 
even until all things shall be fulfilled, 
according to the will of the Father, 
when I shall come in my glory, with 
the powers of heaven; 

"And ye shall never endure the pains 
of death; but when I shall come in my 
glory, ye shall be changed in the twin- 
kling of an eye from mortality to im- 
mortality: and then shall ye be blessed 
in the kingdom of my Father. 

"And again, ye shall not have pain 
while ye shall dwell in the flesh, nei- 
ther sorrow, save it be for the sins 
of the world: and all this will I do be- 
cause of the thing which ye have de- 
sired of me, for ye have desired that 
ye might bring the souls of men unto 
me, while the world shall stand; 

"And for this cause ye shall have 
fullness of joy; and ye shall sit down in 
the kingdom of my Father; yea, your 
joy shall be full, even as the Father 
hath given me fullness of joy; and ye 
shall be even as I am, and I am even 
as the Father; and the Father and 1 
are one; 

"And the Holy Ghost beareth record 
of the Father and me; and the Father 
giveth the Holy Ghost unto the chil- 
dren of men, because of me. 

"And it came to pass that when Je- 
sus had spoken these words He touched 
every one of them with his finger, save 
it were the three who were to tarry, 
and then He departed. 

"And behold, the heavens were 
opened, and they were caught up into 
heaven, and saw and heard unspeak- 
able things. 

"And it was forbidden them that 
they should utter; neither was it given 
unto them power that they could utter 
the things which they saw and heard; 

"And whether they were in the body 
or out of the body, they could not tell; 
for it did seem unto them like a trans- 
figuration of them, that they were 
changed from this body of flesh into 
an immortal state, that they could be- 
hold the things of God. 

"But it came to pass that they did 
again minister upon the face of the 
earth: nevertheless they did not min- 



42 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



lster of the things which they had 
heard and seen, because of the com- 
mandment which was given them in 
heaven. 

"And now whether they were mortal 
or immortal, from the day of their 
transfiguration, I know not; 

"But this much I know, according 
to the record which hath been given, 
they did go forth upon the face of the 
land, and did minister unto all the peo- 
ple.uniting as many to the Church that 
would believe in their preaching; bap- 
tizing them; and as many as were 
baptized, did receive the Holy Ghost; 

"And they were cast into prison by 
them who did not belong to the Church. 
And the prisons could not hold them, 
for they were rent in twain, 

"And they were cast down into the 
earth. But they did smite the earth 
with the word of God, insomuch that 
by his power they were delivered out 
of the depths of the earth; and there- 
fore they could not dig pits sufficient 
to hold them. 

"And thrice they were cast into a 
furnace, and received no harm. 

"And twice were they cast into a den 
of wild beasts; and behold they did 
play with the beasts, as a child with 
a suckling lamb, and received no 
harm. 

"And it came to pass that thus they 
did go forth among all the people of 
Nephi, and did preach the Gospel of 
Christ unto all people upon the face 
of the land; and they were converted 
unto the Lord, and were united unto 
the Church of Christ, and thus the peo» 
pie of that generation were blessed, ac- 
cording to the word of Jesus. 

"And how I, Mormon, make an end 
of speaking concerning these things 
for a time. 

"Behold, I was about to write the 
names of those who were never to 
taste of death; but the Lord forbade, 
therefore I write them not, for they 
are hid from the world. 

"But behold I have seen them, and 
they have ministered unto me; 

"And behold they will be among the 
Gentiles, and the Gentiles knoweth 
them not. 

"They will also be among the Jews, 
and the Jews shall know them not. 

"And it shall come to pass, when the 
Lord seeth fit in His wisdom, that they 
shall minister unto all the scattered 



tribes of Israel, and unto all nations, 
kindreds, tongues and people, and shall 
bring out of them unto Jesus many 
souls, that their desire may be ful- 
filled, and also because of the convinc- 
ing power of God which is in them." 

It seems that these men shall have 
a peculiar endowment, and that en- 
dowment shall be the convincing pow- 
er of God. 

"And they are as the angels of God, 
and if they shall pray unto the Father 
in the name of Jesus, they can shew 
themselves unto whatsoever man it 
seemeth them good; 

"Therefore great and marvelous 
works shall be wrought by them, be- 
fore the great and coming day, when 
all people must surely stand before 
the judgment seat of Christ; 

"Yea even among the Gentiles shall 
there be a great and marvelous work 
wrought by them, before that judg- 
ment day." 

Now, you wonder why so many Gen- 
tiles are turning their hearts toward 
the truth. We can learn that there is a 
change brought about by agencies in 
addition to the witnesses that were 
spoken of yesterday by Elder Roberts. 

God bless you. Amen. 

ELDER JONATHAN GOLDEN KIM- 
BALL. 

Thoughts on temporal interests— The need of 
being devotional and self-sacrificing. 

I readily discover, my brethren and 
sisters, that this congregation do hun- 
ger and thirst for the word of God, 
and it is through this that the Apostles 
and those that have spoken unto you 
have been given such great liberty, 
and why you have been fed by the 
servants of the Lord under the influ- 
ence of the Holy Spirit. It is now your 
duty to not only listen but to digest; 
not only to ' make resolutions, but to 
live up to the instructions that have 
been given, if you expect to receive 
the blessings of the Lord. 

There is a principle that I desire to 
talk upon for a few moments. I have 
the idea, but it is not yet clothed, but 
I pray the Lord that He may move 
upon me through your faith and 
prayers, to explain my views upon a 
certain subject. I am very much in- 
terested myself in the financial wel- 



ELDER JONATHAN G. KIMBALL.

fare of this people, because I realize 
from my own experience that when 
men are in financial difficulties, and 
their honesty is in question, and they 
are unable to fulfill their agreements, 
it is very difficult for honest men who 
are sensitive to the reproach of the 
children of men to feel joyous and 
happy, and to appreciate the bless- 
ings with which they are surrounded. 
I want to say to you that the sun 
not shine brightly to such men, 
the grass is not green, and sometimes 
I fancy, they hardly feel that water 
runs down hill. It is a most terrible 
condition to be in. One of the great 
difficulties that menace this people 
is the lack of employment for our 
people. I know how some of us wor- 
ship gold and silver, but I tell you 
that is not so great a problem among 
this people as employment. I am not 
in much doubt that the time will be 
in these United States when the people 
will worship work more than they do 
money, and it is one of the demands 
that I make upon thlB people, that 
they see to it that the people of this 
Church are employed. If you have 
large farms, and you are poor and 
poverty stricken with so much land, 
see to it that the people are given em- 
ployment. Then the people must see 
to it that they are willing to take the 
produce of the country as pay for 
their labor, and not ask the farmer to 
give them gold and silver, which it 
is very difficult for him to get. 

With all due respect to some things 
that are being done, I believe that it 
is absolutely necessary — God requires 
it of this people — that they pay their 
tithes and offerings, and that the 
offerings be used for the people that 
are old, aged and infirm. It is one of 
the most destructive things that has 
happened in this Church when strong, 
able-bodied men and women, and 
young men and women are provided 
from its offerings which are given for 
the poor. I know the spirit that is 
creeping in among this people. I re- 
member a certain experience I had 
when the scarlet fever struck my fam- 
ily. After they had recovered I sought 
most diligently in one of our own 
thriving settlements for a little help. 
I found families that were poor, and 
that were being supported by the 



Bishop. When I asked them to come 
and assist my wife — and I offered them 
the best I had (for which I was grate- 
ful to my Heavenly Father), that is, 
tithing office scrip— they said, "we can 
get enough of that without working." 
I have told some of my brethren that 
there is no man in this Church that 
has been treated better than I have 
by the authorities of the Church, and 
I am wonder-struck when I think of 
how I have been blessed; but I tell my 
brethren, "when you have not employ- 
ment for me, say the word, and I will 
take my family by the hand, and I 
will again be a pioneer in the land." 
We have hundreds of brilliant young 
men, men that have • experience; 
but they are hanging around 
these streets and starving 
to death. Do you know what is the 
matter with us? There is a great deal 
of pride connected with it. It is not 
a difficult thing to live in a log hut if 
you have never had anything better, 
but it is a difficult thing to drop to a 
log house when you have been living 
in a castle. But our pride has got to 
be humbled, young men. There are a 
great many of us that ought to be 
sent out. Talk about missionary work; 
they ought to call out of this city 500 
and send them on missions to colonize 
and build up the tens of thousands of 
acres that are in this great State of 
Utah. If the State of Utah is not good 
enough for you, go to Canada. That 
is a wonderful country, and you can 
get rich and prosper if you keep the 
commandments of the Lord. Then you 
can come back to Salt Lake City, and 
put on all the style you want to, if 
you pay for it. 

I desire to read to you from the Book 
of Doctrine and Covenants. I will put 
my text to the last part of my dis- 
course, instead of the first. I wish to 
call to your mind what the Lord 
says: 

"I, the Lord, stretched out the 
heavens, and built the earth as a very 
handy work, and all things therein 
are mine: 

"And it is my purpose to provide for 
my Saints, for all things are mine; 

"But it must needs be done in mine 
own way; and behold this is the way 
that I, the Lord, have decreed to pro- 
vide for my Saints, that the poor shall 



44 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



be exalted, in that the rich are made 
low; 

"For the earth is full, and there is 
enough and to spare; yea, I prepared 
all things, and have given unto the 
children of men to be agents unto 
thcnselves. 

"Therefore, if any man shall take 
of the abundance which I have made, 
and impart not his portion, according 
to the law of my Gospel, unto the poor 
and the needy, he shall, with the 
wicked, lift up his eyes in hell, being 
in torment." 

So that I fancy we had better com- 
mence to get generous and impart of 
the abundance which the Lord has giv- 
en us and give employment to the 
thousands of people that are in need. 
The trouble that came upon the peo- 
ple in Kirtland was brought about 
for these reasons which I will read to 
you: 

"But behold they have not learned 
to be obedient to the things which 
I required at their hands, but are full 
of all manner of evil, and do not im- 
part of their substance, as becometh 
Saints, to the poor and afflicted among 
them, 

"And are not united according to 
the union required by the law of the 
celestial kingdom; 

"And Zion cannot be built up un- 
less it is by the principles of the laws 
of the celestial kingdom; otherwise 
I cannot receive her unto myself; 

"And my people must needs be chast- 
ened until they learn obedience, if it 
mvit needs be by the things which 
they suffer." 

Now, Zion will be redeemed, and I 
want to say to you, my brethren and 
sisters, that all is not well in Zion; 
but if you wish to be popular you 
want to say that all is well in Zion. 
The Lord requires it at the hands of 
this people that they pay their tithes 
and their offerings, and that they see 
to it that they impart of the abundance 
which the Lord has given, to those 
that need work, and give them employ- 
ment. The hands of the Presidency and 
the Apostles of this Church are tied 
because we are raising up among this 
people, what I call paupers. It is not 
the fault of the people altogether, it 
is because they cannot find work. I 
pray the Lord that He may move upon 
all of us that are in need of assist- 



ance, that we will have the pride of a 
Latter-day Saint, and not receive any- 
thing when we are able to work, un- 
less we be furnished employment. 
That demand should be made upon the 
Latter-day Saints, and I felt impressed 
that if the time ever came that I had 
no food for my family, I would go 
among the Latter-day Saints and as a 
servant of God I would demand work. 
And if you would not give me work the 
Lord would take from the abundance 
which you are blessed with. 

Now I want to prophesy, as the son 
of a prophet, that if this people want 
to be blessed they must labor for Zion; 
for if you labor for money you shall 
perisb. You are under covenant, and it 
is a demand that God makes of this 
people that they redeem Zion. You 
have got to be generous, and you have 
got to place all that you have and 
are upon the altar and learn to live 
the law of the celestial kingdom. 

"But," says one to me, "you 
would not preach that way four years 
ago when you had something." Well, 
if you have got to learn to preach the 
way I am doing you will learn it just 
the way I learned it. You will pay 
for it. The Lord will take from you 
what you have if you don't humble 
yourselves, and He will chasten you. 
I want to say to you the Gospel is to 
be preached to every nation, kindred, 
tongue and people. We are spending 
no less than $300,000 a year, if I have 
figured right. If your Elders are 
traveling without money they spend 
an awful sight of it, it seems to me, 
and you will be called upon to spend a 
good deal more. You will be called upon 
to place all that you have and are upon 
the altar; and if you do not have 
your feet right and know that this is 
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- 
day Saints, when you are asked to 
give up your means, you will 
flounder and lose the faith; but 
if you have not got anything you will 
be just as Peter was. I am in the 
same fix. If I leave this Church, where 
in heaven will I go. That is the way 
I feel. 

I feel to bless the people. I feel that 
you are being blessed and that you will 
continue to be blessed as long as you 
keep the commandments of God. When 
you cease keeping the commandments 
of God then the judgments of God will

commence at the house of the Lord, 
and I pray that that may be averted. 
I pray that we may not pass through 
the experience that the people had in 
Kirtland because they transgressed the 
laws of God. May the Lord bless you. 
Amen. 

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 

The Saints a charitable people- -Idleness and pau- 
perism should not be fostered — Value of inde- 
pendence and industry. 

My brethren and sisters, I have been 
unexpectedly called upon to make a 
few remarks and as I have not pre- 
meditated upon what to say, it is just 
occurred to me to follow some of the 
remarks that have already been made 
to us this morning, by reading from 
the fourth chapter of Mosiah: 

"Believe in God; believe that He is, 
and that He created all things, both 
in heaven and in earth; believe that 
He has all wisdom, and all power, both 
in heaven and in earth; believe that 
man doth not comprehend all the 
things which the Lord can compre- 
hend. 

"And again: Believe that ye must 
repent of your sins and forsake them, 
and humble yourselves before God; 
and ask in sincerity of heart that He 
would forgive you; and now, if you be- 
lieve all these things see that ye do 
them. 

"And again I say unto you as I have 
said before, that ye have known of 
His goodness, and have tasted of His 
love and have received a remission 
of your sins, which causeth such ex- 
ceeding great joy in your souls, even 
so I would that ye should remember, 
and always retain in remembrance, 
the greatness of God, and your own 
nothingness, and His goodness and long 
suffering towards you, unworthy 
creatures, and humble yourselves even 
in the depths of humility, calling on 
the name of the Lord daily, and stand- 
ing steadfastly in the faith of that 
which is to come, which was spoken by 
the mouth of the angel; 

"And behold, I say unto you, that if 
ye do this, ye shall always rejoice, 
and be filled with the love of God, and 
always retain a remission of your sins; 

and ye shall grow in the knowledge 
of the glory of Him that created you, 

or in the knowledge of that which is 

just and true. 



"And ye will not have a mind to 
injure one another, but to live peaceably, 
and to render to every man according 
to that which is his due. 

"And ye will not suffer your children, 
that they go hungry, or naked; 
neither will ye suffer that they trans- 
gress the laws of God, and fight and 
quarrel with one another, and serve the 
devil, who is the master of sin, or who 
is the evil spirit which hath been 
spoken of by our fathers; he being an 
enemy to all righteousness; 

"But ye will teach them to walk 
in the ways of truth and soberness; 
ye will teach them to love one another, 
and to serve one another; 

"And also, ye yourselves will suc- 
cor those that stand in need of your 
succor; ye will administer of your 
substance unto him that standeth in 
need; and ye will not suffer that the 
beggar putteth up his petition to you 
in vain, and turn him out to perish. 

"Perhaps thou shalt say, the man 
has brought upon himself his misery, 
therefore I will stay my hand, and will 
not give unto him of my food, nor 
impart unto him of my substance that 
he may not suffer, for his punishments 
are just. 

"But I say unto you, O man, whoso- 
ever doeth this, the same hath great 
cause to repent; and except he re- 
penteth of that which he hath done, 
he perisheth for ever, and hath no in- 
terest in the kingdom of God. 

"For behold, are we not all beggars? 
Do we not all depend upon the same 
Being, even God, for all the substance 
which we have; for both food and rai- 
ment, and for gold and for silver, and 
for all the riches which we have of 
every kind? 

"And behold, even at this time, ye 
have been calling on His name, and 
begging for a remission of your sins. 
And has He suffered that ye have 
begged in vain? Nay He has poured 
out His Spirit upon you, and has 
caused that your hearts should be filled 
with joy, and has caused that your 
mouths should be stopped, that ye 
could not find utterance, so exceeding 
great was your joy. 

"And now, if God, who has created 
you, on whom you are dependent for 
your lives, and for all that ye have 
and are, doth grant unto you whatso- 
ever ye ask that is right, in faith, be-

lieving that ye shall receive, O then, 
how had ye ought to impart of the 
substance that ye have one to an- 
other? 

"And if ye judge the man who 
putteth P" his petition to you for your 
substance that he perish not, and con- 
demn him, how much more just will be 
your condemnation for withholding 
your substance, which doth not belong 
to you but to God, to whom also your 
life belongeth; and yet ye put up no 
petition, nor repent of the thing which 
thou hast done. 

"I say unto you, Wo be unto that 
man, for his substance shall perish 
with him; and now, I say these things 
unto those who are rich, as pertaining 
to the things of this world. 

"And again, I say unto the poor, Ye 
who have not and yet have sufficient, 
that ye remain from day to day; I 
mean all you who deny the beggar, be- 
cause ye have not; I would that ye say 
in your hearts, that I give not because 
I have not; but if I had, I would give. 

"And now, if ye say this in your 
hearts, ye remain guiltless, otherwise 
ye are condemned, and your condemna- 
tion is just; for ye covet that which 
ye have not received. 

"And now, for the sake of these 
things which I have spoken unto you; 
that is, for the sake of retaining a re- 
mission of your sins from day to day, 
that ye may walk guiltless before God, 
I would that ye should impart of your 
substance to the poor, every man ac- 
cording to that which he hath, such =is 
feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, 
visiting the sick, and administering to 
their relief, both spiritually and tem- 
porally, according to their wants; 
m "And see that all these things are 
done in wisdom and order; for it is not 
requisite that a man should run faster 
than he has strength. And again: It is 
expedient that he should be diligent, 
that thereby he might win the prize; 
therefore, all things must be done in or- 
der. 

"And I would that ye should remem- 
ber, that whosoever among you that 
borroweth of his neighbor, should re- 
turn the thing that he borroweth, ac- 
cording as he doth agree, or else thou 
shalt commit sin, and perhaps thou 
shalt cause thy neighbor to commit sin 
also. 



"And finally, I cannot tell you all the 
things whereby ye may commit sin; for 
there are divers ways and means, even 
so many, that I cannot number them. 

"But this much I can tell you, that 
if ye do not watch yourselves, and 
your thoughts, and your words, 
and your deeds. and observe 
the commandments of God, and con- 
tinue in the faith of what ye have 
heard concerning the coming of our 
Lord, even unto the end of your lives, 
ye must perish. And now, O man, re- 
member, and perish not." 

I have been reading the words of 
King Benjamin to the people as re- 
corded in the fourth chapter of 
Mosiah in the Book of Mormon, and 
I don't know but what they apply to 
us today, in many ways, as com- 
pletely as they applied to those unto 
whom they were spoken. Yet, I believe 
I can confidently say that the Latter- 
day Saints, as a rule, are among the 
most hospitable, generous and kind- 
hearted people that can be found upon 
the earth. Not long ago one of our 
Elders returned from a mission in the 
South. There had been a question 
raised in his mind as to whether the 
Latter-day Saints in Zion would be 
as open-hander" as hospitable, as kind- 
hearted and as willing to receive and 
entertain a stranger as were the peo- 
ple of the South, and he determined 
to put the matter to the test. The story 
of his visits to some of our people here 
is published in the Improvement Era, 
No. 6. I canot give it to you in de- 
tail, but will only attempt a brief out- 
line. Representing himself as a minis- 
ter of the Gospel from the state of 
Tennessee, traveling without purse or 
scrip, as the Elders of the Church of 
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints were 
generally doing, he called upon Brother 
B. Y. Hampton of the Hampton House 
and asked for entertainment without 
charge. Brother Hampton readily con- 
sented to take care of him. He next 
called at the Temple Barber Shop, 
with a similar representation, and 
asked for a "shave and shingle," on 
the same terms, which was readily 
complied with, and he was asked to 
"come again." He next called upon 
Brother Henry Dinwoodey, and pre- 
senting himself a6 before, asked 
for means to pay his fare on the rail- 
road, going north, whereupon Brother 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMPPH 



47 



Dinwoodey handed him out the money. 
Needing a mainspring in his watch he 
called upon Brother John Daynes and 
Son, and introduced himself as before, 
and they cheerfully repaired his 
watch. He then called upon Col. 
Thomas G. Webber of Z. C. M. I. and 
in the same guise asked for a pair of 
shoes, which Col. Webber generously 
gave him. Having a tooth which needed 
filling, he called at the dental parlors 
of Dr. Fred Clawson, whom he con- 
vinced, after some difficulty, that he 
was not an old friend and school mate, 
but really a minister of the Gospel 
from Tennessee, having a similar name, 
the doctor readily consented to his 
"having his tooth filled without money 
or price. Thus it was proven that the 
Latter-day Saints were as generous, 
as kind-hearted, as ready to help the 
stranger of another religion, as were 
the good people of the Southern States, 
and for that matter of any other coun- 
try. Having put these people to the 
test, in other words, having weighed 
them in the balance and found them not 
wanting in each case he fully ex- 
plained his motive and who he was, 
to their mutual delight. And 
when the Elder returned their 
gifts or declined to receive 
the favors granted him without 
proper remuneration, in each case, 
as I understand, the brethren insisted 
that what they had done was in good 
faith on their part, andi he was wel- 
come to the same, believing that an 
Elder who had spent two years and up- 
wards on a mission, laboring without 
purse or scrip, would be likely to 
stand almost as much in need of such 
help as would the strange minister 
whom he had personated. 

Now some of us are a little more 
fortunate than others. For instance, 
I have several doors, and beggars 
come to all of them; and if ever a 
beggar was turned away from one of 
my doors I never knew it. I have al- 
ways, and so have my family, contrib- 
uted food, and such clothing as we 
could snare to every one who came 
asking for it. Last summer a poor 
boy came to my house. I happened to 
be out of doors, around the corner of the 
house; I heard the voice of a man, I 
looked, and he was sitting on a box. 
I heard that he was murmuring and 
cursing and swearing. I stepped out 



and I said, "My friend, what is the 
matter with you?" He pointed to his 
feet and said, "look at my feet." The 
remnants of shoes which he had on 
them were too small for him. He had 
worn them through the soles and 
through the sides, and his feet were 
out upon the ground. They were 
blistered and inflamed and painfully 
sore. He said he had been driven out 
of Davis county by the officers of the 
law, and was told that if he did not 
get out of the county he would be put 
in jail for vagrancy, and he had come 
here and asked for food, and the peo- 
ple who had given him food had not 
invited him into the house. Now I 
said, "my friend, why do you swear 
about it? It seems to me that a man 
in your circumstances ought to pray 
rather than swear. It would be much 
more becoming in you to humble your- 
self and appeal to the Lord for a little 
assistance from Him, rather than to 
curse and swear as I have heard you 
do. I said to him, "this is my home, 
this is my family who live here, I have 
a very large family and I have all I 
can do to provide for them. So far as 
I can find or provide labor for my chil- 
dren they are out at work, indeed 
some of them are at work who ought 
to be going to school. Notwithstand- 
ing all this, we are willing to help you 
or any other person, so far as we can, 
who comes to us in need; but I don't 
like any one to come upon my premises 
and use profane language, or curst 
and swear. Now, I advise you never 
to swear again, hold sacred the name 
of the Lord, and do a little praying, 
and I'll promise you, you will get 
along better in this world than you 
have done." 

I then called my wife's attention fco 
the condition of this poor boy, and she 
prepared him a good warm bath, gave 
him a clean undershirt and a pair of 
socks, and a pair of boots, and a good 
breakfast, and sent him on his way. 
This is the way we treated this poor 
creature. But we do not treat them 
all that way. We could not afford to 
give all that come boots and socks 
and clothes and baths, for we have not 
enough to go round, but we have al- 
ways managed to give something to 
the poor, and refuse no one who asks 
for food. I believe this is the general 



4 S 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



sentiment and character of the Latter- 
day Saints. I think all the 
Mormon people are kindly dis- 
posed, and are generous toward 
the poor and unfortunate, and that 
there is not a Latter-day Saint under 
the sound of my voice or anywhere 
that would not divide his portion with 
his fellow creature in case of need. 
I have this testimony to bear to the 
Latter-day Saints. President Cannon 
asks whether I would advise, where 
men come asking for food, that they 
be invited to do a little work for it. 
I should most decidedly be in favor of 
asking a man who had plenty of time 
on his hands, and nothing else, and 
who had physical strength, to devote 
a little of his time and strength by 
way of compensating for that which 
he received. But you want to watch 
them a little; I am not talking now o£ 
the Latter-day Saints who seek for 
employment. There are very few Lat- 
ter-day Saints who have to beg, in- 
deed I know of none, and I am sorry 
there are any professing to be Latter- 
day Saints who do beg; there ought 
not to be any Latter-day Saint beg- 
gars. The beggars that we have are 
those that are not of us, and they are 
sometimes very wicked in their hearts, 
and not at all grateful at times for 
what they receive. I have seen men 
go away from my door with good 
bread and butter in their hands (good 
enough for any king to eat, for my 
folks make good bread and good but- 
ter, as good as I ever ate on earth) 
and when out of the gate they have 
thrown it into the street. It was not 
food they wanted. They wanted 
money. For what? That they might 
go to some gambling hell or to some 
drinking saloon. Of course they are 
responsible for that. "We can only 
judge by appearances and by the 
promptings of the good spirit within 
us; and it is better to give to a dozen 
that are unworthy than to turn away 
empty one worthy person. 

There is another phase of this ques- 
tion that I want to refer to. There is 
such a thing as encouraging idleness 
and fostering pauperism among men. 
Men and women ought not to be will- 
ing to receive charity unless they are 
compelled to do so to keep them from 
suffering. Every man and woman 
ought to possess the spirit of inde- 



pendence, a self-sustaining spirit, that 
would prompt him or her to say, when 
they are In need, "I am willing to 
give my labor in exchange for that 
which you give me." No man ought 
to be satisfied to receive, and to do 
nothing for it. After a man is brought 
down to poverty and is under the 
necessity of receiving aid, and his 
friends give it him, he should feel that 
it is an obligation under which he is 
placed, and when the Lord should 
open his way he would return the gift. 
That is the feeling we should culti- 
vate in our hearts, to make us a free 
and independent people. The cultiva- 
tion of any other feeling or spirit than 
this is calculated to make paupers, to 
degrade and bring mankind down to 
beggary, which is a most wretched 
condition for men to be in. It is a bad 
thing for men to think the world owes 
them a living, and all they have to do 
is to beg or steal to get it. When it 
comes to this class of people I am very 
much of the mind expressed once by 
Dr. Johnson, when a beggar came to 
him and asked alms and insisted that 
the doctor should be generous in help- 
ing him, "for," said he, "doctor, you 
know that I must live." But the doc- 
tor said, "I don't see the least neces- 
sity for it." When a man becomes a 
parasite, living upon the charity of his 
friends, I confess it is hard to see the 
necessity for him to live. He is no 
good to any one. I speak this way 
only of such as are able-bodied, such 
as have their faculties and can devote 
these to some industry, to some use- 
ful labor. I don't refer to the cripple, 
to those who are enfeebled by age, be- 
cause I look at them in an entirely 
different light; there is a necessity for 
them to live, and there is a necessity 
for us to assist such, but there is no 
great need in this world for men and 
women who. are able to work and will 
not work. Men come to our Bishop 
and to the Apostles and ask, "What 
shall we do? "We are without employ- 
ment. "We cannot get anything to do, 
and what shall we do?" The Bishop 
says, "pack up your knapsack, if you 
have one, or if you have not take 
your bandana handkerchief to put 
your clothes into, if you have any- 
thing but what is on your back, and 
go out into the outer settlements 
where there is land to take up, where 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH 



there is water to take out of the river, 
and where there is an opportunity for 
you to take up a farm, cultivate the 
soil, and eventually raise cows, sheep, 
chickens, pigs and other useful ani- 
mals and produce from mother earth 
enough to feed and clothe you, and 
thereby make yourself an independent 
citizen, a useful member of society, 
and contribute something to the wel- 
fare of mankind, and prove that the 
world is better for your being in it. 
-Well, but," one of our good brethren 
says, "that was all right enough, 
Bishop, in olden times, but times are 
different now." Of course the times 
are different now. A boy starting out 
in the world now-a-days as we used 
to do, without anything, sees his 
neighbors enjoying the possession of 
good, comfortable homes, he sees a 
great many people that are rich, who 
can ride in their carriages, and have 
every luxury, and he, under the im- 
pression that he js as good as they 
and as much entitled to riches as they 
are, feels that because he has not as 
much as they have, he is in some way 
injured or persecuted, and envy and 
enmity spring up in his soul toward 
the rich, and he feels that they are 
his enemies and that he has a right to 
be theirs. That is wrong. It is just 
as easy to make a living out of the soil 
now with comparatively nothing to be- 
gin with as it was for the Pioneers 
when they first came into this valley, 
were it not for the pride that we have, 
providing we go where land and watei 
await the labor necessary to subdue 
and utilize them, instead of idly cov- 
eting the possessions of others, ana 
nursing the thought that we ought to 
have as good as they have. If we will 
go to work and earn and produce that 
which we need, we are entitled to it, 
and the Lord will bless every man who 
honestly and faithfully undertakes to 
get it out of mother earth. The Lord 
Almighty in the beginning, designed 
that we should earn our bread by the 
sweat of our brow, and we should 
produce from the earth that which Is 
needful for food and clothing and to 
build us habitations. He has provided 
gold and silver and iron and precious 
stones in vast abundance in the earth, 
and it is legitimate for men to gather 
all these from the earth, because they 



49 



are useful for mankind. The Lord 
has provided these things; and there 
is nothing on the face of the globe 
nor in its depths that God has pro- 
vided for the use of man, that is 
not legitimate for us to take and use 
if we do so wisely and prudently. 
They are all designed for our good. 

Now let us not encourage pauperism, 
or beggary; let us not encourage the 
thought that the Church or that the 
world owes any man a living, except 
it be the worthy poor— the Lord's poor 
—or by his honest labor he earns it. 
I heard a fellow one time say, "the 
world owes me a living and I will be 
damned if I don't have it." Such a 
man as that would have it if he had 
to steal it, and after a while he would 
have it if he had to murder some man 
who had riches, in order to rob him 
of his possessions. This is the spirit 
of murder and robbery. The spirit 
which creeps into the hearts of men 
to receive alms and obtain something 
for nothing, making them believe it is 
due them without honest work is, in 
part, the same spirit, at least it is a 
spirit that leads on to murder and 
robbery, in order that its passion 
might get what "the world owes" him, 
as he imagines. Now the world owes 
me a living provided I will go to work 
to produce it by honest labor. The 
earth has been good and generous to 
all those who have honestly labored 
upon its bosom, and who have sought 
succor and assistance from it. It has 
been a good mother. It has yielded 
in its strength for the good of man 
when he has put his labor upon it 
industriously and faithfully; such have 
reaped their harvest in its season and 
have partaken of its fruits in abund- 
ance. Let us seek then to obtain our 
living in this way, if the Lord per- 
mits us to do it; and if He calls us to 
any other business let us attend to 
that as faithfully as we would attend 
to the cultivation of the soil if we were 
permitted to occupy ourselves in that 
direction. 

God bless you is my prayer in the 
name of Jesus. Amen.

"There was a man of the Pharisees 
named Nicodemus, a ruler of the 

Jews: 

"The same came to Jesus by night, 
and said unto Him, Rabbi, we knoAv 
that thou art a teacher come from 
God: for no man can do these miracles 
that thou doest, except God be with 
him.

Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except 
a man be born again, he cannot see 
the kingdom of God. 

"Nicodemus saith unto Him, How 
can a man be born when he is old? 
can he enter the second time into his 
mother's womb, and be born? 

"Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I 
say unto thee, Except a man be born 
of water, and of the Spirit, he cannot 
enter into the kingdom of God. 

"That which is born of the flesh, is 
flesh; and that which is born of the 
Spirit, is spirit. 

"Marvel not that I said unto thee. 
Ye must be born again. 

"The wind bloweth where it listeth, 
and thou hearest the sound thereof, 
but canst not tell whence it cometh, 
and whither it goeth; so is every one 
that is born of the Spirit. 

"Nicodemus answered and said unto 
Him, How can these things be? 

"Jesus answered and said unto him, 
Art thou a master of Israel, and know- 
est not these things? 

"Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We 
speak that we do know, and testify 
that we have seen; and ye receive not 
our witness." 

It has been demonstrated at this 
Conference that the same Spirit that 
existed in the primitive Chruch ex- 
ists in the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints today. The testi- 
monies that have been borne by those 
who have addressed us have all given 
witness of the same thing, that we 
are living in the dispensation of the 
fullness of times. We are bearing oui

testimony to the world that the angel 
that John saw on the Isle of Patmos, 
when he received that wonderful rev- 
elation, showing things that should 
happen hereafter, has come. In that 
revelation was given a description of 
the Church of Christ going into the 
wilderness, the Priesthood being taken 
from the earth, Rev. XII, the estab- 
lishment of false systems that would 
made all nations to drink of the wine 
of the wrath of her fornication. Rev. 
XVII. Jchn also saw a mighty angel 
fly in the midst of heaven, having the 
everlasting Gospel to preach to those 
who dwell upon the earth, crying with 
a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory 
to Him, for the hour of His judg- 
ment is come. Rev. XIV. We testi- 
fy that this angel has come, 
that this everlasting Gospel has> 
been restored, and that the Gospel of 
the kingdom is being preached by the 
Latter-day Saints in all the world for 
a witness. We take unto them the 
glad tidings of great joy. We call 
upon mankind everywhere, no matter 
what their profession may be, to wor- 
ship the living and true God, who 
hath spoken in these last days. We 
cry unto them repentance, reformation, 
to cease from their evil ways, and to 
worship the living and true God, and 
to obey His Gospel. We entreat them 
to be baptized by immersion for the 
remission of sins, that they may en- 
joy the blessings resulting therefrom, 
and that they may be sanctified by 
the precious blood of Christ, which 
follows the water, and be prepared for 
me reception of the Holy Ghost. We 
promise unto them if they will obey 
this form of doctrine; if they will 
humble themselves before the Lord, 
and seek wisdom at His hands; if 
they will give unto the Lord the 
broken heart and the contrite spirit, 
they shall know, as we know, that 
these principles are true. 

We are sending our missionaries all 
the time, and when they return they 
v.<*n testify that God lives, that Jesus 
is the Christ, that Joseph Smith wa& 
a true Prophet sent of God. If they 
did not know it when they staited out 
to preach the Gospel, they obtained 
this information before they came 
back, simply because our Father in 
heaven is doing His own work. It 
does not require an artificial education 



to prepare a man to declare the word 
of the Lord unto the peopie. It is not 
by wisdom, it is not by might, it is 
not by oratory, it is not by logic; but 
it is "by my Spirit, saith the Lord." 
Our message unto the people is on<; 
that every individual is interested in, 
no matter what his profession may be. 
The word of the Lord is to. every in- 
dividual. As the Lord Jesus Christ 
said to His ancient Apostles, so He 
hath said in these last days: 

"Go ye into all the world, and preach 
the Gospel to every creature. 

"He that believeth and is baptized 
shall be saved; but he that believeth 
not shall be damned." 

You may ask why this condemna- 
tion should come unto the people. 
Simply because it is not our message; 
it is the message of God Almighty'. 
Whoso receiveth us receiveth Him; 
whoso rejecteth us rejecteth Him. 

The great problem before the world 
is, was Joseph Smith sent of God, or 
was he not? No matter how much 
you may vilify him, no matter how 
much evil may be said concerning him, 
it is a solemn fact that he was sent or 
God, and we bear testimony that wt 
know it. We have been gathered out 
of the world. We were Catholics, we 
were Protestants of various denomin- 
ations, and when the word of the Lord 
came to us we obeyed it. A great 
many of our friends rejected it; but 
those of us who have obeyed it have 
this living testimony that we know 
that God lives, we know that Jesus 
is the Christ, we know that Joseph 
Smith was a true Prophet of God, and 
we know that the Church of Christ, 
in its present organized state upon the 
earth, is the Church of the Redeemer, 
and that the signs follow the believer. 
Test our principles. As far as we are 
concerned as a people, we are a 
variety. The wheat and tares are 
growing together, are they not? The 
wise and the foolish virgins are living 
together, are they not? But the Lord's 
own love Him and keep His command- 
ments. They do not rob Him in tithes 
and offerings. They are consistent tu 
their profession and in their faith. 
They hear the word of God and do it. 
Although none of us pretend to be 
good (for our Royal Master said that 
no one was good save God), still by

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



way of comparison we say we have 
the good, the King's own, those who 
love Him and keep His command- 
ments. You may know them when 
you take them by the hand. They are 
filed with thanksgiving and praise to 
God for the redemption that He has 
wrought out; and we say with the 
Psalmist of old: 

"O give thanks unto the Lord, for 
"he is good; for His mercy endureth for 
«ver. 

"Let the redeemed of the Lord say 
■so, whom he hath redeemed from the 
Tiand of the enemy; 

"And gathered them out of the lands, 
from the east, and from the west, from 
the north, and from the south. 

"Oh, that men would praise the Lord 
for His goodness, and for his wonder- 
ful works to the children of men!" 
Ps. CVII. 

We are the redeemed of the Lord. 
We have accepted of the principles of 
redemption, and consequently have 
been sanctified in the precious blood 
of Christ. Those who love God and 
keep His commandments represent 
Htm and the Lord Jesus Christ. They 
love one another, and they are known 
"by their works. Their faith is mani- 
fested by their works. Then we have 
a class that are not so good, that aie 
not so faithful. They have not the 
faith of the Gospel so much as this 
first class, who represent the celestial 
kingdom. But they are those who rob 
the Lord in tithes and offerings. They 
are those who are not valiant for the 
testimony of Jesus. They are those 
who do not magnify their calling. 
Consequently we say they are not so 
good. Then we have another class, I 
presume, representing the telestial. 
They are good for nothing. But we 
call them all good. These are the sim- 
ple facts In the case. We manifest 
our position by our works. This im- 
mense congregation here, I suppose 
we represent the different degrees of 
glory. It is to be hoped not. It is to 
be hoped that we represent the celes- 
tial kingdom. But according to the 
testimony of the Spirit that was 
manifested here by some of the breth- 
ren who spoke, there are quite a num- 
ber who profess to be Latter-day 
Saints, but are not of the celestial 



kingdom, simply because they do not 
love God and are lukewarm. 

I do not know how far we may 
be justified in going into debt; 
but we were admonished years ago by 
President John Taylor to keep out of 
debt. We are too generous. We are 
too thoughtless. There has been an 
immense amount of means spent for 
educational purposes. It is a good 
thing, if we do not get an arti- 
ficial education. I regard the 
education of the world as an 
artificial education. You do not see 
faith manifested; you do not see the 
power of God maifested. You have a 
people that are lifted up because of 
their scholastic attainments, like men 
are lifted up when they acquire the 
riches of this world. They are lifted 
up in pride, and think themselves bet- 
ter than those who have not been so 
fortunate as themselves to obtain that 
class of an education. I say it is an 
artificial education. If we are going 
to redeem Zion, we will have to re- 
deem it by faith. And Zion could be 
redeemed today if we would live the 
principles of the Gospel. But as long 
as we are hearers of the word and we 
do not do the will of the Lord, Zion 
will never be redeemed by us. It will 
be redeemed by the laws of the celes- 
tial kingdom. If we cannot live the 
laws of the terrestrial kingdom, how 
is it possible we can attain to celestial 
glory? If we cannot live the condi- 
tion that lead to the celestial glory, 
we cannot obtain it. If we cannot live 
the principles that lead to the terres- 
trial glory, we cannot attain to it. 

This Gospel of the kingdom is to 
every individual, whether they are 
Jew or Gentile, bond or free, Catholic 
or Protestant. It is the word of the 
Lord to them to cease from all their 
evil ways; and all their false worship, 
and from teaching for commandments 
the doctrines of men; for the Lord has 
stretched forth His hand again. As 
He declared by the Prophet Isaiah: 

"For as much as this people draw 
near me with their mouth, and with 
their lips do honor me, but have re- 
moved their heart far from me, ana 
their fear toward me is taught by tht 
precept of men; 

"Therefore, behold, I will proceed to 
do a marvelous work and a wonder, 



ELDER GEORGE TEASDALE. 



for the wisdom of their wise men shali 
perish, and the understanding of their 
prudent men shall be hid." [Isa. 
XXIX, 13. 14.] 

Here is an object lesson — the gather- 
ing of this people today at this Confer- 
ence, under the shadow of a Temple 
of God, pointing to the nations that 
God has restored His Priesthood and 
given authority to men to officiate in 
the ordinances of the House of the 
Lord. Here is the fulfillment of the 
prophecy: 

"And it shall come to pass in the last 
days, that the mountain of the Lord's 
house shall be established in the top 
of the mountains, and shall be exalt- 
ed above the hills; and all nations 
shall flow unto it. 

"And many people shall go and say. 
Come ye, and let us go up to the 
mountain of the Lord, to the house of 
the God of Jacob; and He will teach 
us of His ways, and we will walk in 
His paths." [Isa. II, 2, 3.] 

That is what I came here for. That 
is what my fellow laborers came here 
for. We came to this country to learn 
the ways of God and to walk in His 
paths. We had a testimony given unto 
us in the lands where we were born, 
God revealed himself unto us by the 
power of His Spirit, and bore testi- 
mony to us that Joseph Smith was 
sent of God. We testified of this 
forty-five years ago, and have been 
testifying of it ever since. We do not 
beguile the people. We are their 
friends. We do not teach them in- 
correct principles. We do not dis- 
tribute in various counties anti-Cath- 
olic tracts or anti-Protestant tracts. 
We have respect for every man's 
opinion. We show him the better 
way. If he has something good, we 
show him there is something better, 
we have the truth, the light and the 
way, and we invite all mankind to 
come and assist us in the establish- 
ment of the righteousness of God upon 
the earth. 

My beloved brethren and sisters, the 
Lord requires our appreciation. He 
wants us to appreciate Him and His 
loving kindness. He wants us to ac- 
knowledge His hand in all things. He 
wants our hearts. He wants us to love 
Him and keep His commandments. 
This is the word of the Lord, will we do 



it? Will we cease from our conten- 
tion? Will we cease from our back- 
biting, our evil speaking? Will we 
cease from all evil and learn to do 
right, and walk in the light as He is 
in the light, that we may have sweet 
fellowship with each other, and that 
the blood of Christ may cleanse us 
from all sin? This is the question that 
comes to every individual. The word 
of the Lord is to us individually. Will 
we love Him and keep His command- 
ments, and seek to establish His 
Zion? It is no use coming to Con- 
ference and hearing the word of the 
Lord unless we do it. There have 
been powerful testimonies borne here 
from the commencement, when Pres- 
ident Cannon referred to the fulfillment 
of prophecy. It is common amongst 
us. We have the testimony of Jesus 
and it is the spirit of prophecy. We 
do not say this boastingly; we say it 
because it is true. We understand our 
own nothingness, our own insignifi- 
cance, and that we are entirely de- 
pendent upon God our Eternal Father. 
We do not profess to any partlculai 
virtues; but we are striving to love 
God and keep His commandments, and 
to glorify Him in our good works. 
We preach the Gospel of righteousness; 
and we are just as much responsible 
to carry out these principles as those 
unto whom the word is given through, 
us. The Lord will have our heartb, 
and He will not allow us to put our 
affections upon anything that would 
overshadow our affection for Him. 

Let me say, in conclusion, that the 
principle of tithing is a correct prin- 
ciple. The Lord requires one-tenth of 
everything that He gives to us. I 
never heard this principle more sim- 
ply explained than by one of our good 
sisters in teaching a Primary class in 
the Sabbath school. She said to the 
children, "Supposing your father was 
to give you ten apples, and he asked 
you to give one of them back again, 
and you would not do it, would you 
not be considered very covetous?" 
Why, they smiled to think that the 
father should give them ten apples 
and they should be unwilling to give 
him one back again. That is just the 
position we are in when we are not 
willing to obey this law. The Lord 
requires one-tenth of everything that 



54 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



in the dispensation of His providence 
He gives unto us. That is all He 
asks, and that we should have our 
ears open to the cry of the widow and 
the fatherless, that we should be gen- 
erous and large-hearted, that we 
should not be covetous. Can you not 
understand this principle? We want 
to give Him half, or a quarter, or we 
want to bite a piece off the apple and 
give it to Him. Anything but what is 
due Him! Do not, for our own sake, 
make this record. As we value our hap- 
piness and our own advancement, let 
us be true and faithful in the discharge 
of our duties, and not rob the Lord 
our God; for everything that we have 
is given unto us by Him. And He 
has declared that if we will love Him 
and keep His commandments, we shall 
prosper in the land. Do you believe 
it? I bear testimony that the law of 
tithing is true. "Prove me now 
herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, 
if I will not open you the 
windows of heaven, and pour you 
out a blessing, that there shall not be 
room enough to receive it." [Mai. Ill, 
10.] 

I can bear testimony to the truth 
of the remarks of Brother Merrill, 
that if a man will love God and keep 
His commandments, He will deliver 
him from all evil and from all his 
financial troubles. We exhort the 
world to do this; but here are a num- 
ber of people, gathered from the north 
and the south, the east and the west, 
and they demonstrate that they do not 
appreciate it. How do they demon- 
strate it? By robbing Him in tithe» 
and offerings; by being slothful in 
their duties; by being indifferent to 
the magnifying of the Aaronic and 
Melchisedek Priesthoods. And Zion 
can never be redeemed under such a 
condition. I say to all, especially to 
myself, repent, and let us turn over a 
new leaf; let us cease our slothfulness, 
our indifference, and let it be manifest 
to Almighty God that we appreciate 
His loving kindness, that we appre- 
ciate His redemption, that we appre- 
ciate the glorious hope of everlasting 
lives, in a glorious resurrection, by our 
works being coupled with our faith to 
the glory of the Father, through 
Jesus Christ. Amen. 



ELDER JOHN HENRY SMITH. 

Impetus to mutual Improvement— Organization 
of home beneficent societies— The crisis in o>r 
National affairs. 

I do not remember having heard a 
single word, either read or spoken, by 
our brethren during this Conference 
that I did not endorse. It seems to 
me that each one of the brethren has 
presented some item that should cause 
us to reflect seriously upon the good- 
ness and mercy extended unto us by 
our Heavenly Father. The aged who 
heard the cry in the land from whence 
they came, "Come out of her my peo- 
ple, that ye be not partakers of her 
sins, and that ye receive not of her 
plagues," should rejoice, and their 
children and their children's children 
should continue in that rejoicing. One 
suggestion contained in the remarks 
of Elder Merrill this forenoon, of the 
brother who would have been pleased 
to have taken from his swill barrel 
the food that was applied in the di- 
rection of providing for domestic ani- 
mals, is one, probably, that hosts of 
young people whose homes have been 
in this mountain region, cannot as yet 
fully appreciate. Fathers and mothers 
of mature years may appreciate this 
suggestion; some of our brothers and 
sisters who have been unsuccessful in 
securing proper labor, within re- 
cent years, may have been made to 
taste in some limited degree these 
conditions, as did the early Pioneers in 
their experiences — the blessing that a 
well-stocked swill barrel would pre- 
sent to the hungry man or woman. 
Each suggestion presented for our 
consideration during this Conference 
has been of a practical character, 
whether applied directly to the tem- 
poral conditions that surround us in 
life or to those conditions that we 
speak of as spiritual. The labors and 
ministrations of the past few months 
by quite an army of young men, un- 
der the direction of President Wood- 
ruff and his aids, who made a tour of 
the various Stakes in Zion, and visit- 
ed the homes of the people, interviewed 
their sons and their daughters, and 
awakened an interest in the minds of 
those sons in those associations estab- 
lished in connection with the work of 
God, and the calling in, as suggested 



ELDER JOHN HENRY SMITH.

in the remarks Of one of the brethren, 
of about 13,000 souls, give to us the 
possibilities of missionary work among 
the covenant people of God and pre- 
sent before our vision the opportunity 
to consider the possibilities that at- 
tend the spread of the truth among 
those spirits who have been forgotten 
and reared among that gathered Is- 
rael who have been called to come 
forth from among the people of the 
world. Many received and believed 
the testimonies of our young brethren 
whose hearts and minds were bent 
upon arousing to life by nurturing it, 
the Gospel that had been planted in the 
breasts of the number that I have 
named. It cannot be anticipated that 
the brief but earnest efforts made 
during the winter season to gather 
the young men into these associations 
organized for them can have accom- 
plished all that should be desired in 
connection with this matter. But it 
is a matter of joy to those who have 
been engaged in this ministry, that 
our Father did sweeten their words and 
arouse to reflection the hosts of young 
men who will remain earnest and de- 
voted laborers within this fold, and 
who, perchance, will be found when- 
ever they will be needed in connection 
with the development of the work of 
God, using the talents with which 
their Maker has endowed them for 
the furtherance of His purposes. 
There remains, without doubt, large 
numbers who may have been aroused 
temporarily to reflect upon the sacred 
obligations of the Gospel, and who 
may have fallen temporarily from 
grace to be followed by the laborers 
in these various fields with a devo- 
tion and earnestness that shall cause 
them to continue, at least, to strive 
to know more fully of the work of 
God. With their hearts gladdened 
and their minds aroused, their under- 
standings educated, the spirit of truth 
distilled upon those minds shall fasten 
there, that none of them, perchance, 
may fail in the receipt of the impress 
of the Spirit of the living God in such 
form as to brighten their entire lives. 

I trust, my brethren and my sisters, 
fathers and mothers, Bishops and 
counselors, Presidents of Stakes and 
High Councilors, that the work that 
has been inaugurated in this direction 



— which calls from the den of infamy, 
from the places where loafers congre- 
gate and from the places where evil 
and crime is begotten, through the 
gathering together of young men and 
young boys, assailing each man in the 
spirit of that missionary labor which 
has called so many during the brief 
period of the last winter season to at 
least enroll themselves in the hope of 
a nobler and better development of 
themselves, and all maintaining the 
spirit of that work who have been 
aroused from the sleep of idleness to 
the understanding of the relationship 
of the Holy Spirit, will continue their 
ministrations until every son and every 
daughter in Zion, every stranger with- 
in her borders in every home shall 
hear the voice of testimony making its 
declaration that God indeed does live, 
and that His holy truths restored in 
these latter days are surely among 
the children of men. I trust, my breth- 
ren and sisters, that the same spirit 
that has actuated these young men 
who have gone forth to prove Zion, 
to test the faith of parents, to scatter 
the seeds of life, to point out the way 
of the Gospel of the Son of God, will 
have touched your hearts in such form 
that in no home where the truth of the 
Gospel has come shall the father or 
mother, the son or daughter fail in 
any degree, having received the sweet 
influence, heard the still small voice 
of the spirit, to nurture and care for 
and develop its force and its power 
within their breasts. 

There is another item that I have 
upon my mind, upon which I wish to 
speak for a few moments, as I discovei 
in my associations among the peopie 
that there is a continuous tendency 
for our young men, as wall as many of 
our middle aged men, to ally them- 
selves with the various organizations, 
clubs and societies formed outside of 
the Church, many of them for the pur- 
pose cf insurance, that they f may be 
enabled to secure, perchance, a few 
hundred dollars in the interest of their 
families, should accident happen them, 
or in their own interest provided they 
are enfeebled and unable to discharge 
the duties and responsibilities that 
attach to them. It seems to me that 
in every Stake of Zion there is ample 
capacity to organize mutual aid soci- 



56 



GENERAL CONFER EACE. 



eties within our own circles, among 
oui own members, and retain at home 
any profits that may ar«se from stitch 
organizations. All the organizations 
of this character within our State are 
sending off hundreds of dollars to aid 
in the maintenance of people in other 
sections of the land. We have the 
skill, we have the ability, we ought to 
have the practical common sense, to 
be able to form and adjust these as- 
sociations within our own circles. One 
hundred men, or three hundred, pay- 
ing their dollar a week or dollar a 
month into a fund manipulated and 
managed by themselves, within their 
own circle, and thus utilize to profit 
and aid their brother who may be 
afflicted, or to pay to a sister should 
a brother be removed from the home 
circle. As it is, these organizations 
are reviving their money and sending 
a certain percentage continuously to 
the heads of the various societies from 
which they receive their organizations, 
and keeping a portion of it possibly at 
home. I believe that care and atten- 
tion should be bestowed upon these 
matters, and the formation of mem- 
bership in those organizations that 
look after and guard you in some 
measure should not occur among the 
Latter-day Saints, but I would not 
arouse a spirit of antagonism in 
this respect. It is just as legitimate, 
just as proper for you to form your 
organizations in your circles in which 
you legitimately move as that others 
should form them and you pay tribute 
to them. 

I desire to raise my voice in com- 
mendation of the position that has 
been assumed by President McKinley 
and his cabinet on the question affect- 
ing Spain, and to say to you, my 
brethren and sisters, it should be the 
prayer of the Latter-day Saints that 
our nation be preserved from war, 
and that the efforts to maintain peace 
should be carried to the utmost limit 
before bloodshed should be resorted to. 
I trust that this feeling pervades the 
hearts of the people called Latter-day 
Saints, and that all of us feel within 
our souls a determination to stand for 
the principles of right, and sustain our 
government in every proposition of 
liberty, justice and mercy and the 
maintenance of these principles of 
righteousness, the prevention of the 



shedding of blood, to the most reason- 
able extreme. I feel, my brethren and 
sisters, to thus give utterance to the 
sentiments of my own heart and mind 
upon this question, and that the 
prayers of the people should go up in 
an appeal that God shall guide the 
destinies of this great government in 
such form that its mission of liberty 
to the human race may be accom- 
plished, in that way that life and 
property, and happiness and peace, 
and not bloodshed, shall come to the 
children of men. We recognize our 
Father's purpose in connection with 
the development of this work, and the 
world receiving the message we have 
to bear will be remembered by Him 
in the wars and rumors of wars that 
shall exist among the nations, and in 
the seas heaving themselves beyond 
their bounds. But we claim, with 
hands lifted to high heaven, that we 
believe the Constitution of the United 
States was a revelation from God, and 
opened the door of liberty in such form 
that His sons and daughters should 
be permitted to possess every right 
and every privilege that mortal should 
be permitted to enjoy in the flesh. 
The extension of these sentiments and 
these views lie dearest to the heart of 
every man and every woman who has 
become conversant with the Gospel of 
the Lord Jesus Christ, and I trust that 
we will not permit ourselves in the 
midst of the excitement that arises 
to shout for bloodshed, but on the con- 
trary to desire that God shall direct 
the hand that has been placed to guide 
the destinies of this nation at the pres- 
ent time, and make the minds of 
leading men of the nation wise 
and broad and firm upon the princi- 
ples of right. 

May heaven's peace and blessing 
abound in every heart; may God be 
glorified, the' truth spread, liberty in- 
crease, justice and mercy abound, is 
my prayer, in the name of Jesus. 
Amen. 

At the conclusion of Elder Smith's 
remarks the great congregation arose 
and, with the choir, sang, with deep 
feeling, 

"My country 'tis of thee, 

Sweet land of Liberty."

In 1833 the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints was driven out of 
Jackson County, Mo., for the word of 
God and testimony of Jesus Christ. 
There Bishop Partridge was tarred 
and feathered by the mob. That was 
the time of the falling of the stars jn 
that country. Soon afterwards Bish- 
op Partridge called for volunteers to 
go to Kirtland to see the Prophet. 
Two men volunteered out of those who 
had been driven from Jackson County. 
One was Parley P. Pratt and the other 
was Lyman Wight. They went to 
Kirtland and laid before the Prophet 
the circumstances, and the Prophet 
called these two men, and others, to 
go abroad and gather up the strength 
of the Lord's house and to prepare 
the camp of Zion. Parley P. Pratt 
came to my house. I had just been* 
baptized. I was engaged for a year in 
furnishing lumber by contract. Parley 
P. Pratt told me it was my duty to 
lay aside all my temporal matters, go 
to Kirtland, and join Zion's camp. I 
obeyed his counsel. I arrived in Kirt- 
land on Saturday and there met with 
Joseph and Hyrum Smith in the street. 
I was introduced to Joseph Smith. It 
was the first time that I had ever seen 
him in my life. He invited me home 
to spend the Sabbath with him, and I 
did so. They had meeting on Sunday. 

On Sunday night the Prophet called 
on all who held the Priesthood to 
gather into the little log school house 
they had there. It was a small house, 
perhaps 14 feet square. But it held 
the whole of the Priesthood of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints who were then in the town of 
Kirtland, and who had gathered to- 
gether to go off in Zion's camp. That 
was the first time I ever saw Oliver 
Cowdery, or heard him speak; the 
first time I ever saw Brigham Young 
and Heber C. Kimball, and the two 
Pratts, and Orson Hyde and many 
others. There were no Apostles in the 
Church then except Joseph Smith and 
Oliver Cowdery. When we got to- 
gether the Prophet called upon the 
Elders of Israel with him to bear 
testimony of this work. Those that 



I have named spoke, and a good many 
that I have not named, bore their 
testimonies. When they got through 
the Prophet said, "Brethren I have 
been very much edified and instruct- 
ed in your testimonies here tonight, 
but I want to say to you before the 
Lord, that you know no more concern- 
ing the destinies of this Church and 
kingdom than a babe upon its mother's 
lap. You don't comprehend it." I 
was rather surprised. He said "it is 
only a little handfull of Priesthood 
you see here tonight, but this Church 
will fill North and South America — it 
will fill the world." Among other 
things he said, "it will fill the Rocky 
Mountains. There will he tens of thou- 
sands of Latter-day Saints who will 
be gathered in the Rocky Mountains, 
and there they will open the door for 
7 establishing of the Gospel anions 
the Lamanites, who will receive the 
Gospel and their endowments and the 
&43yhSTs of God. This people will go 
into the Rocky Mountains; they will 
there build temples to the Most High. 
They will raise up a posterity there, 
and the Latter-day Saints who dwell 
in these mountains will stand in thi? 
flesh until the coming of the Son of 
Man. The Son of Man will come to 
them while in the Rocky Mountains." 

I name these things because I want 
to bear testimony before God, angels 
and men that mine eyes behold the 
day, and have beheld for the last fifty 
years of my life, the fulfillment of 
that prophecy. I never expected to see 
the Rocky Mountains when I listened 
to that man's voice, but I have, and 
do today. I will say here that I shall 
not live to see it, you may not live to 
see it; but these thousands of Latter- 
day Saint children that belong to the 
Sabbath schools, I believe many of 
them will stand in the flesh when the 
Lord Jesus Christ visits the Zion of 
God here in the mountains of Israel. 
And while I bear testimony before 
God, angels and men, that mine eyes 
behold the fulfillment of the revelation 
given that night, I just as much be- 
lieve the remaining part of it will be 
fulfilled as I stand here in the flesh. 
I rejoice at seeing the progress of the 
work that lies before us. There is a 
great work before this people in the 
fulfillment of these prophecies that

have been given. Joseph Smith was 
full of revelation. He foresaw this 
people, and this work until it was 
wound up. 

My prayer to God is that we may 
pursue such a course that we may en- 
joy and receive all these blessings, and 
our posterity after us. Amen. 

ELDER FRANCIS M. LYMAN. 

The volume of progress Increasing — The Renins of 
peace and the 8 lrlt of patriotism— Portents of 
war— Hospitality of southern people— Salvation 
and life In the Gospel . 

The time of this Conference is very 
precious, but it is sufficient for us to 
bear our testimonies to one another 
and to speak of the goodness of the 
Lord. This is a great day in Zion; a 
great day for Israel. This is the 
nucleus of the work of our Heavenly 
Father. This Tabernacle, this great 
Temple, this great people gathered to- 
gether, is the great center for the work 
of the Lord in the earth, and the honor 
and the glory shall be the Lord's and 
not ours. The work is progressing 
more rapidly than ever before. We 
are working harder abroad and at 
home. The Presidency and the Apos- 
tles, and home missionaries and for- 
eign missionaries are all laboring dili- 
gently, and their efforts are being 
crowned with success. 

The time will never come, probably, 
until the Savior appears, when we will 
not have difficulties to overcome and 
trials to pass through. We are here 
for that purpose, and every trial that 
has been given to us, of every nature, 
has been for our benefit, and has 
tended to try and prove us. We may 
be tried in war as well as in peace, but 
we should be peacemakers. "Blessed 
are the peacemakers, for they shall be 
called the children of God." We want 
peace. We should preach peace, teach 
peace, pray for it, live for it, and do 
everything on earth for peace that is 
honorable before we engage in war. 
We love our country. We love our 
kindred and friends, like other people, 
and are willing to serve our country; 
and there is no doubt, if the difficulties 
are to commence at the house of the 
Lord, that the Latter-day Saints will 
be proven in this regard. So far, we 
have not had occasion to engage in 
the wars of our country to any very 



great extent, but when we have been 
called upon we have always respond- 
ed; and if our nation should be In 
trouble today, as It seems to be threat- 
ened, the government of our country 
will find as generous a response from 
this State as from any other state in 
the Union, according to the number 
of the people; for we love the insti- 
tutions of liberty and of freedom. But 
we want peace, because we are a 
peaceable people, and we want to 
preach the Gospel that has been re- 
stored to us. The authority of the 
Lord has been conferred upon us that 
the Gospel may be preached among 
all nations. That is our mission, and 
we don't want war. The mothers 
don't want war. The fathers don't 
want war. We wish to avoid it if it 
can possibly be done. We desire to be 
numbered among the peacemakers who 
shall be called the children of God. 
Our faith should be exercised to ob- 
tain peace and to maintain it in the 
earth; for war is terrible. It was ter- 
rible when there was war in heaven, 
and the rebels were overcome and cast 
out, and then peace reigned there. 
War may come to our country. Ru- 
mors of wars are heard in every land. 
We will see what the Savior says in 
regard to this matter: 

"For as the lightning cometh out of 
the east, and shineth even unto the 
west; so shall also the coming of the 
Son of man be. 

"And Jesus went out, and departed 
from the temple; and His disciples 
came to him for to shew him the 
buildings of the temple. 

"And Jesus said unto them, See ye 
not all these things? Verily I say unto 
you, There shall not be left here one 
stone upon another, that shall not be 
thrown down. 

"And as He sat upon the mount of 
Olives, the .disciples came unto Him 
privately, saying, Tell us, when shall 
these things be? and what shall be 
the sign of Thy coming, and of the end 
of the world? 

"And Jesus answered and said unto 
them, Take heed that no man deceive 
you. 

• "For many shall come in my name, 
saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive 
many. 

"And ye shall hear of wars, and ru- 



ELDER ERA AC. 

mors of wars; see that ye be not 
troubled; for all these things must 
come to pass, but the end Is not yet. 

"For nation shall rise against nation, 
and kingdom against kingdom; and 
there shall be famines, and pestilences, 
and earthquakes in divers places. 

"All these are the beginning of sor- 
rows." 

"Watch, therefore; for ye know not 
what hour your Lord doth come. 

"But know this, that if the good man 
of the house had known in what watch 
the thief would come, he would have 
watched, and would not have suffered 
his house to be broken up. 

"Therefore be ye also ready; for in 
such an hour as ye think not, the Son 
of Man cometh. 

"Who then is a faithful and wise 
servant, whom his lord hath made 
ruler over his household, to give them 
meat in due season? 

"Blessed is that servant, whom his 
lord, when he cometh, shall find so do- 
ing. 

"Verily I say unto you. That he shall 
make him ruler over all his goods. 

"But and if that evil servant shall 
say in his heart, My lord delayeth hib 
coming; 

"And shall begin to smite his fellow- 
servants, and to eat and drink with 
the drunken; 

"The lord of that servant shall come 
in a day when he looketh not for him, 
and in an hour that he is not aware 
of, 

"And shall cut him asunder, and ap- 
point him his portion with the hypo- 
crites; there shall be weeping and 
gnashing of teeth." 

We have heard today from Presi- 
dent Woodruff the words of the Proph- 
et Joseph, spoken sixty-five years ago. 
He told at that time what we see to- 
day, and that this is the preparation 
of the people of God for the coming of 
the Lord upon the earth. And He will 
come, and His coming will not be de- 
layed. The end, however, is not yet, 
but approaches. And it is important 
that those who have received author- 
ity from heaven should be like watch- 
men upon the walls of Zion, and speak 
forth to the multitude when God com- 
mands, and say, be not troubled, for 
the end is not yet. Be not troubled 
because there are wars and rumors 
of wars in the earth, for these things 



'S M. LYMAN 59 

must be; but let Ud attend to our labor 
and let us pray that this cup of 
trouble and war may pass, because It 
would be terrible. It always has been 
terrible and it will always be, to the 
end, when wars and trouble come. 
Christians should always pray and la- 
bor for peace. The last thing for 
Christians to ever do is to fight for 
peace. 

When I listened to President Smith 
this morning relating the experience 
of an Elder who had been traveling 
here without purse and scrip, and how 
generously he was treated, I could not 
help but remember how not only one 
Elder was treated in the Southern 
States, but how the Elders were treat- 
ed by the forties — not in a city like 
Salt Lake City, but in the country 
where people were sparsely settled. 
They would take in forty and fifty of 
us at a time, and they were not Lat- 
ter-day Saints either. They would 
feed us, and lodge us, take care of us 
and move us for four days at a time. 
They did this in numbers of instances 
in the Southern States. The Elders 
there are feeling splendidly, and their 
influence among the people and th-? 
officials of the country is good. The 
great change that has been wrought 
in the hearts of the people in that 
country is remarkable, since President 
Woodruff announced, at the dedica- 
tion of the Salt Lake Temple, that 
that great change would come. It has 
come, and the word of God through 
him has been fulfilled and continues 
to be fulfilled and will be to the very 
letter. The words of the Lord will all 
be verified that are contained in this 
sacred book (the Bible), though infi- 
dels and others may war upon it, it is 
the truth, it is the word of God. Men 
may do as they please with it, but it 
contains the truth. And it contains 
the history of the dealings of God 
with His children. The same is true 
with regard to the Book of Mormon 
and the Book of Doctrine and Cov- 
enants. Men will war upon them, as 
they have upon the Bible, but they 
will not war any more successfully 
or industriously. For these books, be 
it known, contain the words of the 
Lord. I bear my testimony to their 
truth and divinity, and to the divinity 
of the mission of the Prophet Joseph 
Smith, and of the mission of the 



6o 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



Prophet Brigham Young, and of Presi- 
dent John Taylor and of President 
Wilford Woodruff, Prophets of the 
Lord, and their brethren who are here. 
I bear testimony to the divinity of youi 
mission as well as ours. For your mis- 
sion is just as sacred as ours. You are 
the children of God. You have had 
His testimony and spirit burning in 
your souls. He has endowed you rich- 
ly with it— all of us more generously 
than we deserve. He has thus led us 
and He has established and settled utj 
in the truth. 

In the doctrines of the Gospel there 
is salvation and life, and they meet 
every requirement of the human heart. 
There is not a thing that the soul of 
man or woman needs in this life, or 
in the life to come, that is not met in 
the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and this 
organization which is so perfect and 
so complete. We can therefore afford 
to be generous. I did thank the Lord 
when I was in the Southern States and 
in the Eastern and Northern States, 
that I could stand before those people 
and invite their ministers to come to 
Utah and we would offer them congre- 
gations and an auditorium such as 
cannot be found elsewhere in the 
United States. We invite them to 
come and lay their doctrines before 
the people. We want to know what 
the doctrine of the world is. We don't 
want the people kept in ignorance of 
what there is in the earth. If it were 
so would we be found putting, today, 
in our magazine for the young people, 
what we are publishing — the doctrines 
of Catholics and of Protestants of 
every denomination, written from 
their own standpoint, and laying them 
before the people? Our pulpits are 
open to all men of reputable standing 
in the world, who are made welcome 
to talk to us. It gave us strength and 
an influence in the earth to be able to 
state these facts. Why, there is no 
such sight to be seen in the world as 
this Tabernacle of the Lord. There is 
nothing to compare with it. In its 
design it is remarkable. Just realize 
what has been accomplished by a poor 
people. And if we be poor today, the 
way is open to us to have all the 
means we need. We should retrench 
in our living, and save means. There 
is means in abundance and to spare 



among the Latter-day Saints today, to 
meet all the obligations of individuals 
and of the people generally. And we 
ought to so order our lives in harmony 
with the instructions given us today 
by Elder Merrill, which are so choice, 
that we may meet our obligations. 
Let those who have ample themselves 
assist those who have not. And let 
them live together as one family and 
bring salvation to each and all. The 
very Words of Wisdom given to us for 
the temporal salvation of the people 
would, in three years, meet all the ob- 
ligations of this Church and of every 
member in it, if we would observe that 
counsel. Not only to save the means 
that are spent for tea, coffee, tobacco 
and liquor, but to eat less of meats 
and let the meat be sold to others, and 
let us live upon the fruits and vege- 
tables. There is a fortune in these 
things for the people, and in this way 
we can easily become free. We ought 
to be the most independent people upon 
the face of the earth for means of every 
kind. 

I pray the Lord to bless you, my 
brethren and sisters, and to bless ut> 
during this Conference. Oh, how 1 
thank the Lord whenever President 
Woodruff stands up and talks to the 
Church! And we want that voice for 
so many years yet to remain among 
us. We do not want his voice stilled. 
For the voices of the others of the 
older ones have been stilled who bore 
the Apostleship in the days of the 
Prophet Joseph. President Woodruff 
is the only man living that enjoyed 
that honor during the life of the 
Prophet Joseph. Let me exhort you, 
my brethren and sisters, to be indeed 
Latter-day Saints. Take care of your- 
selves individually and be Saints of 
God; and remember if we do not sur- 
vive until the coming of the Son of 
Man, we are. then, anyway, in the very 
condition we ought to be in to pass, 
away. We are ready to die and to 
meet the Lord. It is as necessary that 
we should be ready to meet Him on 
the other side, as to be prepared for 
Him at His coming here. But He will 
come, and He will come in the pres- 
ence of the nations of the earth. They 
shall know it and shall fear and trem- 
ble at the coming of the great God to 
reign upon the earth. This is my tes-

timony to you and to the world. And 
I speak as one who is authorized thus 
to speak of the Son of God, the Re- 
deemer of the world. God bless you. 
Amen.

Brethren and sisters, for our instruc- 
tion this morning, in part at least, I 
will read some paragraphs in the Book 
of Doctrine and Covenants: 

"My disciples, in days of old, sought 
occasion against one another, and for- 
gave not one another in their hearts, 
and for this evil they were afflicted, 
and sorely chastened; 

"Wherefore I say unto you, that ye 
ought to forgive one another, for he 
that forgiveth not his brother his tres- 
passes, standeth condemned before 
the Lord, for there remaineth in him 
the greater sin. (Doc. and Cov., Sec. 
64, pars. 8 and 9.) 

"For whoso is faithful unto the ob- 
taining these two Priesthoods of which 
I have spoken, and the magnifying 
their calling, are sanctified by the 



Spirit unto the renewing of their 
bodies; 

"They become the sons of Moses and 
of Aaron and the seed of Abraham, 
and the church and kingdom, and the 
elect of God; 

"And also all they who receive this 
Priesthood receiveth me, saith the 
Lord; 

"For he that receiveth my servants 
receiveth me; 

"And he that receiveth me receiveth 
my Father; 

"And he that receiveth my Father, 
receiveth my Father's kingdom; there- 
fore all that my Father hath shall be 
given unto him; 

"And this is according to the oath 
and covenant which belongeth to the 
Priesthood. 

"Therefore, all those who receive the 
Priesthood, receiveth this oath and 
covenant of my Father, which he can- 
not break, neither can it be moved." 
(Doc. and Cov., Sec. 84, pars. 33 to 40.) 

With the exercise of your faith, I 
wish to say a few words, perhaps not 
altogether in connection with what 
I have read, but as the Spirit shall 
dictate. I always feel very dependent 
and humble when I stand before and 
attempt to address a people that have 
been serving the Lord and, at least 
as a general thing, are worthy to be 
called Latter-day Saints, a people that 
have received a knowledge of the 
things of God, and are moving onward 
in the path of exaltation and glory to 
the fulness of their salvation. As I 
believe, when we come together as we 
have this beautiful morning, it be- 
comes our privilege to receive instruc- 
tion from those persons that address 
ws, and if we do not the fault, gen- 
erally, is in ourselves. It is our priv- 
ilege as Latter-day Saints to seize 



62 



GENERAL C OA FERE ACE 



upon those opportunities that are 
afforded us to make a proper prepar- 
ation for the scenes that are before us 
and in which we may be called to act; 
and as the difficulties which we hav* 
to meet shall increase upon us per- 
haps and become harder to overcome, 
we need more strength in order to re- 
sist the temptations and to discharge 
the obligations that devolve upon us. 
I suppose it would be with Latter-day 
Saints generally as with me in regard 
to this point — that as we advance in 
years and come nearer to what we 
generally consider as the time of our 
departure into the other life we are 
more inclined to devote our thoughts 
and reflections upon those things that 
we anticipate we may receive in the 
next life, the circumstances that may 
surround us there, and the proper 
preparation that we have made and 
are making to reach that which we 
anticipate. I know it is so with me. 
In my 85th year it naturally occurs to 
me that it is very well to take into 
consideration these matters, and deep- 
ly too; to reflect upon the past, to sec 
whether we have improved the oppor- 
tunities along the line of our trave», 
and been making the proper prepara- 
tion; and if we have not done this, to 
seek now to make amends with double 
diligence. We have a perfect right to 
understand something of what we may 
receive in the other life. We have to 
suffer almost everything in accom- 
plishing the duties that are imposed 
upon us in moving along in this line 
that we have chosen. In the past, if 
we had time we might relate the vari- 
ous sacrifices the Latter-day Saints 
have been called to make; and if they 
did not make these sacrifices their 
own consciences would condemn them, 
because of the light which they had 
received and the knowledge they had 
of what they should do. It has proved 
very truly with the Latter-day Saints 
what Jesus said on a certain occasion, 
when He compared the kingdom of 
God to a man seeking pearls. Having 
found one of very great value, he wen: 
and sold all that he possessed that he 
might secure that pearl. Then again 
He compared it unto a man that found 
a treasure in a field, which, having 
found, he went and sold everything 
that he possesssed in order that he 
might come in possession of that treas- 



ure. That has been the case with the 
Latter-day Saints. We have been 
called to suffer and to sacrifice that 
which was more dear to ourselves 
than our lives, and some have been 
called to sacrifice their mortal exist- 
ence, having been placed in circum- 
stances that they could not avoil 
suffering the loss of their lives. We 
are called upon daily to make sacri- 
fices. The Lord requiring this at our 
hands, and we as a general thing 
having complied, it is our privilege to 
know something in regard to the fu- 
ture — what will be the result of this 
sacrifice, what will be the result of 
traveling upon this path. Indeed a 
Latter-day Saint can hardly sustain 
himself in the Church of God unless he 
does get some knowledge nt this kind, 
that cannot be unfolded ov common 
wisdom. We are no better than other 
people if this be not so. 

I have read something that is very 
peculiar in 3-egard to the promises that 
are made, and which I know will be 
fulfilled, if we on our part do our duty. 
I have not lived in this Church for 
about sixty-two years without finding 
out something. I devoted myself to 
be worthy to receive something that 
no mortal man can receive except 
through the spirit and power of the 
Holy Ghost, and the Lord has shown 
me things and made me to understand 
them as clearly as the sun at noon- 
day in regard to what shall be the out- 
come of those Latter-day Saints thut 
are faithful to their callings. Jasus 
says: 

"He that receiveth me receiveth. my 
Father; 

"And he that receiveth my Father, 
receiveth my Father's kingdom, there- 
fore all that my Father hath shall be 
given unto him." 

This is in the Book of Doctrine and 
Covenants. Now, if it were in the New 
Testament some people, though they 
might not understand it, would pass 
it as being true, because it was in 
the Bible. Weil, I am just as sure of 
its truth as if it were found in the 
New Testament. And the New Testa- 
ment bears us out in this doctrine. 
Jesus said, as recorded in the Revela- 
tion of St. John: 

"To him that overcometh will I grant 
to sit with me on my throne, even as 



PRESIDENT LORENZO SNOW. 



63 



I also overcame, and am sat down 
with my Father in his throne." 

There are many Scriptures bearing 
upon this point. I believe in this. I 
believe that we are the sons and 
daughters of God, and that He has 
bestowed upon us the capacity for in- 
finite wisdom and knowledge, because 
He has given us a portion of Himself, 
we are told that we were made in His 
own image, and we find that there is 
a character of immortality in the soul 
of man. There is a spiritual organism 
within this tabernacle, and that spirit- 
ual organism has a divinity in itself, 
though perhaps in an infantile state; 
but it has within itself the capability 
of improving and advancing, as the 
infant that receives sustenance from 
its mother. Though the infant may 
be very ignorant, yet there are possi- 
bilities in it that by passing through 
the various ordeals of childhood to 
maturity enable it to rise to a superi- 
ority that is perfectly marvellous, 
compared with its infantile ignorance. 
Why and how is it that this is ac- 
complished? Because it possesses the 
susceptibilities and the capabilities of 
its father. So in regard to ourselves. 
There is a divinity within ourselves 
that is immortal and never dies. Thou- 
sands and thousands of years hence 
we will be ourselves, and nobody else, 
so far as our individuality is con- 
cerned. That never dies from all 
eternity to all eternity. Immortality 
never dies, and it is immortal. We 
are as children growing and increas- 
ing in knowledge and wisdom. Some 
men we read of, like Elijah, Elisha, 
Samuel, or Moses, great prophets, ad- 
vanced themselves to that degree of 
knowledge, and develop their immor- 
tal possibilities to an extent that is 
perfectly astonishing. And you and I 
will have to advance in this line until 
we control those things that the world 
cannot possibly do. 

As I read here, there was one thing 
that the disciples of the Savior did not 
accomplish — they did not succeed in 
establishing that union of spirit and 
feeling that they ought to have had, 
and the Lord chastened them for it. 
The Lord requires, that men should 
forgive one another, even seventy times 
seven. And even if the party does not 
ask forgiveness, we are to forgive for 
a certain number of times. He that 



forgives not his brother, we are told, 
there remaineth in him the greater- 
sin— that is, he is a greater sinner than 
the person that offended him. The 
Lord requires us to love our neighbor 
as we do ourselves— a pretty difficult 
matter under many circumstances; 
but we will have to reach that point 
of perfection, and we will reach it. 
Moses, through the divinity that was 
always with him, did some extraor- 
dinary things. The people of Israel 
had abused him in every condition. 
They continually went contrary to his 
counsel, and on a certain occasion they 
appointed a captain to take them back 
into Egyptian bondage. It was as 
much as he could possibly bear to put 
up with their indignities. Finally the 
Lord became angry, His patience be- 
came exhausted, and He made up His 
mind that He would destroy every 
one of them, except Moses, and He 
would take him and make him what 
he proposed to do with Israel — a 
mighty nation. There are very few in 
these days but would have jumped at 
that opportunity, to become as it were 
the starter of a new world, of a mighty 
and an everlasting kingdom. That 
was proposed to Moses by the Lord. 
Well, Moses had educated himself by 
the spirit of God that he was able to- 
act in that way that he might save 
the house of Israel on that very ex- 
traordinary occasion. He called upon 
th-> Lord with mighty faith, and con- 
versed with Him. He tried to explain 
to Him that it was not a good proposi- 
tion at the least. He argued with Him 
as one man argues with another. How 
was he capable of doing this? Why, 
he had seen God face to face, as some 
men have seen Him in these latter 
days, and he knew that he could rea- 
son and talk with Him. He told the 
Lord that if He did what He pro- 
posed — destroy Israel — the nations 
around would say that He had under- 
taken a task that He could not suc- 
ceed in accomplishing. Well, the Lord 
changed His mind, so it reads, and 
did not that which He had intended 
to do. Now, whether the Lord had a 
disposition in this matter to try Moses, 
may be a question; but the distinct 
understanding with Moses was that if 
He did not plead with the Lord all 
Israel would be destroyed. It was the 
divinity within Moses, brought up to 



6 4 



G&NERAL conference. 



such a high point, that enabled him 
to do this. There was a divinity with- 
in Abraham also. No mortal man 
could have done what Abraham did — 
taking up on Mount Moriah his only 
son as a sacrifice — except he were in- 
spired and had a divinity within him 
to receive that inspiration. We read 
of these extraordinary manifestations 
in the lives of the prophets. We find 
men at the present day that never 
could have done what they have done, 
never could have made the sacrifices 
they have, unless there had been a 
receiving and comprehending of the 
language of divinity — the Spirit. 

As to our receiving these wonderful 
things about which I have read to you, 
I am just as sure of it as I am that 
I am talking to you today. Although 
it seems marvelous, it is here so stat- 
ed, and I know the Lord tells that 
which is true. When He gives com- 
fort to His Saints in His promises, 
those promises when fulfilled are vast- 
ly greater than the words seem to have 
indicated. President Woodruff could 
not have gone through the scenes that 
he has, and come out alive as He has, 
unless there had been a divinity within 
him — a part of God himself — receiving 
and understanding that divine Spirit 
that came to him and enabling him to 
accomplish what he has. Other men 
might be mentioned in the same way. 
Joseph Smith, the Prophet, with whom 
I was intimately acquainted for years, 
as well as I was with my brother, I 
know him to have been a man of in- 
tegrity, a man devoted to the interests 
of humanity and to the requirements 
of God all the days in which he was 
permitted to live. There never was a 
man that possessed a higher degree 
of integrity and more devotedness to 
the interest of mankind than the 
Prophet Joseph Smith. I can say this 
from a personal acquaintance with 
him. 

Latter-day Saints, we have had a 
lovely Conference, and the weather has 
been very beautiful. The Lord has 
blessed us abundantly. Here we are, 
gathered from many of the nations of 
the earth, and it has been a most 
marvelous accomplishment. God alone 
could have accomplished it. And the 
prospects before us are grand and 
glorious. The time is speedily coming 



— we do not want to talk very much, 
though, about going to Jackson Coun- 
ty, Missouri, because through our 
foolishness and weakness we would 
not care anything about building 
houses and making ourselves com- 
fortable here. I know when we first 
started a colony in Brigham City, the 
people generally thought it was non- 
sense, perfectly useless, to plant peach 
trees, apple trees, currant bushes and 
the like, because we were going to 
Jackson County so speedily; and it 
was with the utmost effort that we 
were enabled to disabuse them of this 
idea. We are not going tomorrow, nor 
next day, this week or next week; but 
we are going, and there are many — 
hundreds and hundreds within the 
sound of my voice that will live to go 
back to Jackson County and build a 
holy temple to the Lord our God. Be 
prepared to do these things that have 
been taught us during this Confer- 
ence, and make ourselves worthy, and 
we will receive everything that I have 
read to you in this section. We have 
not time to explain these things. We 
bear our testimony in regard to what 
we know, and what God has done for 
us, and what we hope to do with His 
assistance, and leave it in that way. 

God bless you, Latter-day Saints. 
We love to serve you, and to do every- 
thing that the Lord enables us to do, 
because we expect to be together in 
the other life, from all eternity to all 
eternity. May God help us, in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 

At the conclusion of President Snow's 
discourse the choir sang: 

O, my Father Thou that dwellest, 

In the high and glorious place! 
When shall I regain Thy presence, 

And again behold Thy face? 
In Thy holy habitation 

Did my spirit once reside; 
In my first primeval childhood 

Was I nurtured near Thy side? 

PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH. 
The oath and covenant of the Priesthood— The 
promise to those who abide conditions— The 
fate of those who whdllyrenounce them— The house 
of God a house of order— His will as conveyed 
through His servants should be obeyed— Anony- 
mous false accusers. 

My brethren and sisters, I desire the 
faiith, the goodwill and the prayers of 
my hearers, that I may be able to 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH 



65 



speak the truth, and that the Lord may 
give me a knowledge of His will, that 
what I say may be in accordance 
therewith and for the benefit of all of 
us. If I should fall to speak toward 
that pillar in front, I ask my brethren 
behind me to call me to order; for it is 
one of my failings to turn to the right 
and to the left when I am speaking. 
Not that I am disobedient in my spirit, 
but I do not bear in mind always that 
which is for the best good. 

I will take the liberty of re-reading a 
portion of the Scripture that was read 
this morning by President Lorenzo 
Snow; not that I expect to throw any 
additional light upon the subject, but 
may perhaps continue it to some little 
extertt: 

"For whoso is faithful unto the ob- 
taining of these two Priesthoods of 
which I have spoken, and the magnify- 
ing their calling, are sanctified by the 
Spirit unto the renewing of their 
bodies; 

"They become the sons of Moses and 
of Aaron and the seed of Abraham, and 
the Church and kingdom, and the elect 
of God; 

"And also all they who receive this 
Priesthood receiveth me, saith the 
Lord; 

"For he that receiveth my servants 
receiveth me; 

"And he that receiveth me receiveth 
my Father; 

"And he that receiveth my Father, 
receiveth my Father's kingdom; there- 
fore all that my Father hath shall be 
given unto him; 

"And this is according to the oath 
and covenant which belongeth to the 
Priesthood. 

"Therefore, all those who receive the 
Priesthood, receive this oath and cov- 
enant of my Father, which he cannot 
break, neither can it be moved; 

"But whoso breaketh this covenant, 
after he hath received it, and alto- 
gether turneth therefrom, shall not 
have forgiveness of sins in this world 
nor in the world to come." 

This makes a very serious matter of 
receiving this covenant and this Priest- 
hood; for those who receive it must, 
like God himself, abide in it, and must 
not fail, and must not be moved out of 
the way; for those who receive this 
oath and covenant and turn away from 



it, and cease to do righteously and to 
honor this covenant, and will to abide 
in sin, and repent not, there is no for- 
giveness for them either In this life or 
in the world to come. That is the lan- 
guage of this book, and this is doctrine 
and truth which was revealed from 
God to men through the instrumental- 
ity of Joseph Smith the Prophet. And 
this word is reliable. It is God's word, 
and God's word is truth; and it be- 
comes necessary for all those who en- 
ter into this covenant to understand 
this word, that they may indeed abide 
in it, and may not be turned out of the 
way. 

In connection with this Scripture 
which I have read, I will take the liberty 
of reading a little more, upon a similar 
subject, from the Book of Mormon. 
And while these words which I shall 
now read were the words of a Prophet 
who lived anciently upon this continent, 
and were given before the coming of 
Christ in the flesh, and before the Gos- 
pel was established in its fullness, with 
the Holy Priesthood, in the earth, yet 
it relates to the same oath and cove- 
nant that is spoken of in the Book of 
Doctrine and Covenants. 

"And now it came to pass that when 
king Benjamin had thus spoken to his 
people, he sent among them, desiring to 
know of his people, if they believed the 
words which he had spoken unto them. 

"And they all cried with one voice, 
saying. Tea, we believe all the words 
which thou hast spoken unto us; and 
also, we know of their surety and 
truth, because of the Spirit of the 
Lord Omnipotent, which has wrought 
a mighty change in us, or in our hearts 
that we have no more disposition to do 
evil, but to do good continually." 

What a glorious condition was this! 
a condition in which the Lord God Om- 
nipotent, by the power of His Spirit, 
had wrought a mighty change in the 
hearts of that people, that they no 
longer had any desire to do evil, but 
were filled only with a fervent desire 
to do that which was good. This was 
indeed a great change, and yet it is 
precisely that change that comes today 
to every son and daughter of God who 
repents of his or her sins, who humble 
themselves before the Lord, and who 
seek forgiveness and remission of sin by 
baptism by immersion, by one having 
anthority to administer this sacred or-

GENERAL CONFERENCE 



dinance of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. 
For it lis this new birth that was spoken 
of by Christ to Nicodemus as absolute- 
ly essential that men might see the 
Kingdom of God, and without which 
no man could enter into the Kingdom. 
Each of us can remember, perhaps, the 
change that came into our hearts when 
we were baptized for the remission of 
our sins. Perhaps it is not proper for 
one to speak of himself or of his own 
experiences, because there may be those 
within the sound of my voice who ob- 
ject to a man speaking of himself, and 
especially when he shall say any good 
of himself; yet I speak not of myself, 
I speak of the influence and power of 
the Holy Spirit that I experienced 
when I had been baptized for the remis- 
sion of my sins. The feeling that came 
upon me was that ot pure peace, or 
love and of light. I felt in my soul 
that if I had sinned — and surely I was 
not without sin — that it had been for- 
given me; that I was indeed cleansed 
from sin; my heart was touched and 
I felt that T would not injure the small- 
est insect beneath my feet. I felt as 
though I wanted to do good every- 
where to everybody and to everything. 
I felt a newness of life, a newness 
of desire to do that which was 
right. There was not one particle 
of desire for evil left in my soul. I 
was but a little boy, it is true, when I 
was baptized; but this was the influ- 
ence that came upon me, and I know 
that it was from God, and was and 
ever has been a living witness to me 
of my acceptance of the Lord. 

Oh! that I could have kept that same 
spirit and that same earnest desire in 
my heart every moment of my life 
from that day to this. Yet many of 
us who have received that witness, 
that new birth, that change of heart, 
while we may have erred in judgment 
or have made many mistakes, and 
often perhaps come short of the true 
standard in our lives, we have re- 
pented of the evil, and we have sought 
from time to time forgiveness at the 
hand of the Lord; so that until this 
day the same desire and purpose which 
pervaded our souls when we were bap- 
tized and received a remission of our 
sins still holds possession of our hearts, 
and is still the ruling sentiment and 
passion of our souls. Though we may 
at times be stirred to anger, and our 



wrath move us to say and do things 
which are not pleasing in the sight 
of God, yet instantly, on regaining 
our sober senses and recovering from 
our lapse into the power of darkness, 
we feel humble, repentant, and to ask 
forgiveness for the wrong that we 
have done to ourselves, and perchance 
to others. The great, earnest, over- 
whelming desire, which is born of 
the truth and of the witness of the 
Holy Spirit, in the hearts of the peo- 
ple who obey the truth, assumes sway 
and again takes possession of our 
souls, to lead us on in the path of 
duty. This is my testimony, and 1 
know it is true. 

"And we, ourselves, also, through 
the infinite goodness of God, and the 
manifestations of His Spirit, have 
great views of that which is to come; 
and were it expedient, we could proph- 
esy of all things. 

"And it is the faith which we have 
had on the things which our king has 
spoken unto us, that has brought ut> 
to this great knowledge, whereby we 
do rejoice with such exceeding great 
joy." [Mosiah, Book of Mormon, chap. 
5, vs. 3 and 4.] 

Here now in the following words is 
what I wish to call your attention to, 
it being especially in harmony with the 
reference I have read from the Doc- 
trine and Covenants in relation to the 
oath and covenant of the everlasting 
Priesthood: 

"And we are willing to enter into a 
covenant with our God to do His will, 
and to be obedient to His command- 
ments in all things, that He shall com- 
mand us, all the remainder of our 
days, that we may not bring upon 
ourselves a never ending torment, as 
has been spoken by the angel, that we 
may not drink out of the cup of the 
wrath of God. 

"And now, these are the words which 
King Benjamin desired of them; and 
therefore he said unto them, Ye have 
spoken the words that I desired; and 
the' covenant which ye have made is 
a righteous covenant." [Mosiah, chap. 
5, vs. 5 and 6.] 

Surely, it is a righteous covenant. 
It could not be other than a righteous 
covenant; for the covenant was with 
God, to do His will, to be obedient to 
His commandments in all things all 
the remainder of their days. Cer- 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH I SMITH.

tainly this is good; this is a proper 
covenant to make on the part of falli- 
ble man, and it is an eternal covenant, 
entered into with that Eternal God 
who deals with His children not as 
temporal or mortal beings, who appear 
to live but a short span in the earth 
and then pass away, but who deals 
with reference to the immortality of 
their being. There is nothing that God 
has done for the children of men that 
is solely of a temporal character. He 
deals with us with a view to our eter- 
nal being, our immortality; with refer- 
ence to the fact that we are His chil- 
dren, or ought to be, and will be when 
we enter into this covenant and ob- 
tain the change of heart which enter- 
ing into this covenant is sure to bring 
to the honest in heart. 

"And now, because of the covenant 
which ye have made, ye shall be called 
the children of Christ, His sons, and 
His daughters; for behold, this day 
He hath spiritually begotten you; for 
ye say that your hearts are changed 
through faith in His name; therefore, 
ye are born of Him, and have become 
His sons and His daughters. 

"And under this head, ye are made 
free, and there is no other head where- 
by ye can be made free. There is no 
other name given whereby salvation 
cometh; therefore, I would that ye 
should take upon you the name of 
Christ, all you that have entered into 
the covenant with God, that ye should 
be obedient unto the end of your lives. 

"And it shall come to pass that who- 
soever doeth this, shall be found at 
the right hand of God, for he shall 
know the name by which he is called; 
for he shall be called by the name ot 
Christ." [Mosiah, 5th chap. vs. 7, 8 
and 9.] 

Think of that! Who understands 
its import, the scope of its meaning? 
"Ye shall be called by the name of 
Christ." 

"And now it shall come to pass, 
that whosoever shall not take upon 
them the name of Christ, must be 
called by some other name; therefore, 
he findeth himself on the left hand of 
God. 

"And I would that ye should re- 
member also, that this is the name 
that I said I should give unto you that 
never should be blotted out, except it 



be through transgression; therefore, 
take heed that ye do not transgress, 
that the name be not blotted out of 
your hearts." [vs. 10 and 11.] 

In other words, as the Doctrine and 
Covenants has it: 

"Therefore, all those who receive the 
Priesthood, receive this oath and cove- 
nant of my Father, which he cannot 
break, neither can It be moved; 

"But whoso breaketh this covenant, 
after he hath received it, and alto- 
gether turneth therefrom, shall not 
have forgiveness of sins in this world 
nor in the world to come." 

I wish to admonish this vast con- 
course of people to take this great 
truth to their hearts. Let it take pos- 
session of your minds, think upon it, 
consider well your standing, and your 
continuance in repentance and the re- 
mission of sins, and in the love of 
truth, and in the earnest desire to do 
right and forsake all evil. Consider 
yourselves and see whether you have 
transgressed this great covenant into 
which you have entered, because if 
you have and you do not repent of it, 
but continue in disobedience to this 
covenant, and choose to remain in sin, 
then, as God lives, and as He has 
spoken in His word, there is no for- 
giveness for you in this world nor in 
the world to come. If God's word Is 
true at all, then this is true; and it 
applies to such of us as have entered 
into the new and everlasting covenant, 
having been born again, or spiritually 
begotten of Christ, and having be- 
come the sons and daughters of God. 

I continue from the Book of Mor- 
mon : 

"I say unto you, I would that ye 
should remember to retain the name 
written always in your hearts, that ye 
are not found on the left hand of God, 
but that ye hear and know the voice 
by which ye shall be called, and also, 
the name by which He shall call you; 

"For how knoweth a man the mas- 
ter whom he has not served, and who 
is a stranger unto him, and is far from 
the thoughts and intents of his heart? 

'And again: Doth a man take an 
ass which belongeth to his neighbor, 
and keep him? I say unto you, Nay; 
he will not even suffer that he shall 
feed among his flocks, but will drive 
him away, and cast him out. I say

untn you, even so .shall It be among 
you, if ye know not the name by which 
ye are called. 

"Therefore, I would that ye should 
be steadfast and Immovable, always 
abounding in good works, that Christ, 
the Lord God Omnipotent, may seal 
you his, that you may be brought to 
heaven, that ye may have everlasting 
salvation and eternal life, through 
the wisdom, the power, and Justice, 
and mercy of Him, wno created all 
things, in heaven and in earth, who is 
God above all. Amen." [Book of Mor- 
mon, Mosiah, 5th chap. 12 to 15 vs.] 

There is a great deal of this kind of 
instruction contained within the lids 
of this sacred book, which it would be 
well for us as believers in Christ, as 
sons and daughters of God, having 
been spiritually begotten by Him, 
having been born anew, and the old 
man of sin having been put away, the 
carnal, devilish and sensual desires of 
our human natures having been sub- 
dued or conquered and banished from 
our souls and the new desire for 
righteousness and purity having been 
begotten within us, that we have been 
redeemed from the spiritual death 
which came upon our first parents, and 
which by reason of the fall is upon all 
flesh until they repent of their sins 
and receive a remission of them by 
baptism, or by the new birth — that is, 
by the birth of the water and of the 
Spirit; for the birth of the Spirit comes 
by or through the birth of the water, 
and the gift of the Holy Ghost. We 
are first required to be buried with 
Christ in baptism, typical of His death 
and burial, burying the "old man" with 
his sensual and devilish nature, and 
rising to a newness of life, and thus 
by the spiritual baptism which follows 
through the laying on of hands we be- 
come a son or a daughter of God, an 
heir of God and a joint heir with Jesus 
Christ. It is through this ordinance that 
men are begotten spiritually. It is 
the door through which Jesus him- 
self passed. He is the door, the 
light and the life of the word; 
and if anyone enter by Him, then 
shall he have eternal life; but 
whoso attempteth to get through in 
any other way shall be counted a thief 
and a robber, and we may well judge 
how far he will succeed. 



This is the Gospel that we have cov- 
enanted to obey. We have entered into 
the bond of that new and everlasting 
covenant agreeng that we would obey 
the commandments of God in all things 
whatsoever He shall command us. 
This is an everlasting covenant 
even unto the end of our days. And 
when 1b the end of our days ? We may 
think it has reference to the end of 
our mortal life; that a time will come 
after we have finished this probation 
when we can live without obedience to 
the commandments of God. This is a 
great error. We shall never see the day, 
in time nor eternity, when it will not be 
obligatory, and when it will not be a 
pleasure as well as a duty, for us as 
His children, to obey all the command- 
ments of the Lord throughout the end- 
less ages of eternity. It is upon this 
principle that we keep in touch with 
God, and remain in harmony with His 
purposes. It is only in this way that 
we can consummate our mission, and 
obtain our crown and the gift of eter- 
nal lives, which is the greatest gift of 
God. Can you imagine any other 
way ? 

God has established all things in their 
order. The house of God is a house 
of order, and not a house of confusion. 
In this house, God himself is the su- 
preme head, and He must be obeyed. 
Christ is in the image and likeness of 
His being, His begotten Son, and He 
stands as our Saviour and our God. 
We must walk in His paths, and ob- 
serve His precepts to do them, or we 
will be cut off. Next unto God and 
Christ, in the earth is placed one unto 
whom the keys of power and the au- 
thority of the Holy Priesthood are 
conferred, and unto whom the right 
of presidency is given. He is God's 
mouthpiece to His people, in all things 
pertaining to the building up of Zion 
and to the spiritual and temporal sal- 
vation of the people. He is as God's 
vicegerent; I do not hesitate to an- 
nounce this truth; for it is His word, 
and therefore it is true. The people 
who have entered into covenant to 
keep the commandments of the Lord 
must: hearken unto the voice of him 
who is placed to preside over them; 
and secondarily, to those who are 
called to act with him as his counsel- 
ors in the Holy Priesthood. It takes 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH E. SMITH. 



69 



this council of three to constitute the 
presiding and governing authority of 
the Priesthood in the earth. God the 
Father, God the Son, and God the Holy 
Ghost, constitute the Godhead and the 
matchless governing quorum over all 
the creations of the Father. Three 
men stand at the head of the Church 
on the earth. Yet there are those who 
call themselves Saints who hesitate 
not to rise up in condemnation of and 
to express words of hatred and malice 
toward these men who stand at the 
head of the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints! Of course, they 
often do it clandestinely; ashamed of 
their own acts, too cowardly to at- 
tach their names to their own writings; 
but they nevertheless rise up against 
these men — men whose only thought 
is to do good to all mankind, whose 
greatest care is for the welfare of the 
people of the Lord, and whose constant 
endeavor is to unite them and cause 
them to labor, each in his place and 
calling, to help build up Zion. They 
earnestly desire that every man shall 
be a working bee in "the hive of 
Deseret," in the house of God. If any 
man feels offended at me, let him 
come to me like a man, and tell me 
wherein I have done wrong, and thus 
give me a chance to explain myself. I 
am ashamed of some people who pro- 
fess to be Latter-day Saints. I have 
on my desk anonymous letters, teem- 
ing with a spirit of violence, hatred, 
malice and condemnation toward me, 
and my brethren, especially toward 
President Cannon and myself, for what 
we have never done, or thought of 
doing in the world, condemning us for 
evils that exist only in their 
own wicked imaginations; for no 
man with the Spirit of God 
in his heart will ever condemn 
these men openly, in secret or through 
anonymous letters, numbers of which 
are sent to us from time to time. Par- 
don me for referring to this matter, 
because it is perhaps trivial; but I 
look upon the authors of anonymous 
letters as sneaks, as cowards of the 
lowest type, as among the meanest of 
God's creatures. If a man has any 
fault to find with me, let him come to 
me; or if he has any fault to find with 
Brother Cannon, let him go to him. 
Let him pour out his grievances to us, 
and give us a chance to explain or to 



make reparation if we have done 
wrong; and let him not cowardly hide 
himself behind a nom de plume, or 
anonymous letters breathing wrath 
and vengeance toward the servants of 
the Lord and of the people. We have 
to reprove sometimes in sharpness; but 
if by reproving we have wounded them 
unnecessarily, we will pour out a 
double portion of the balm of meek- 
ness, humility and love toward them, 
that we may heal the wounds we have 
made, just as the Prophet has said in 
the 121st section of the Doctrine and 
Covenants. Read it for yourselves. 

Now, these thoughts have simply 
come to me on the spur of the mo- 
ment. They may have been unneces- 
sary altogether. But I feel Justified, 
so far as I am concerned, in making 
these remarks. If these threatening 
letters were from backsliders or an- 
tagonistic Gentiles, we would not be 
surprised; but when they come signed 
"Your brother in the Gospel" we sup- 
pose, though of course we do not know, 
that they come from men who profess 
to be Latter-day Saints. 

The other day I spoke of counsel 
that was often given to some of our 
poor brethren who were seeking work; 
among other things, that they should 
go out into the new parts of the coun- 
try and take up land, cultivate the soil, 
and build themselves up among begin- 
ners in new settlements, and thereby 
establish homes for themselves. I 
have been told that I had better try 
the medicine myself. Now, I want to 
tell those who do not know it that I 
have tried that very medicine. The 
first plow that I plowed with in this 
valley was made from wagon tires. 
We did not have any plows from the 
East. It was all we could do to bring 
ourselves into this valley with suffi- 
cient to keep soul and body together 
when I came here in 1848. We then fed 
on close rations until the Lord gave 
us the fruits of our labors from the 
soil. I know what it is to go out on 
to the deserts and break up the bar- 
ren ground, and then go to the creeks 
and make ditches to convey the water 
from their natural channels upon the 
soil. I know what it is to earn my 
living by the sweat of my brow. 1 
have done it before; and if the Lord 
wills, and will give me strength to do 
it, I can do it again. I am not above

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



(loin* it, if the Lord requires it. 1 
believe there is no labor on earth more 
essential to the wellbelng of a com- 
munity or more honorable than the 
labor which Is necessary to produce 
food from mother earth. It is one of 
the most noble occupations. And next 
to it is the tending of the flocks of 
sheep and cattle. This fs another 
noble, occupation, if it is only carried 
on properly and righteously. These 
are the foundation of the prosperity 
of every community in the world. 
When the farming community is pros- 
perous, when the Lord blesses the 
earth and makes it fruitful, then the 
blacksmith, the carpenter, and those 
who follow other pursuits, will also be 
prosperous. But when the earth re- 
fuses to yield of its strength for the 
good of mankind, then all other busi- 
ness is stagnant and will languish. 
Therefore, let us till the earth; let us 
cultivate the soil; let us produce our 
own living out of the earth, by the 
blessing of God, as far as we possibly 
can, always keeping in mind that we 
have entered into a solemn covenant 
with God, which is an eternal cove- 
nant, and from which He cannot de- 
part or be moved, and which we can 
only fail in by ourselves transgressing 
that new and everlasting covenant 
and turning away from it. 

God help us to be true and faithful 
to our calling and standing in His 
Church, is my prayer in the name of 
Jesus. Amen. 

Singing by the choir: 

Though in the outward church below 
The wheat and tares together grow, 
Jesus e're long will weed the crop, 
And pluck the tares, in anger, up. 

Benediction by Elder Joseph E. Tay- 
lor. 



OVERFLOW MEETING. 

Assembly hall, 2 p. m. 

As the great Tabernacle was not 
near large enough to accomodate the 
people, an overflow meeting was held 
in the Assembly Hall. 

The choir singing the hymn which 
begins 

Great God, attend while Zion sings. 

Prayer was offered by Elder Willard 
Done. 

The choir sang the hymn, 

God moves in a mysterious way, 
His wonders to perform. 



ELDER DAVID H. CANNON. 

I trust that while I shall endeavor 
to address you, I may have the benefit 
of your faith, that our Father may sug- 
gest words to my mind that will be 
beneficial to those who are here as* 
sc-mbled 

I have re joiced very much in the tes- 
timony of the Holy Spirit that was 
manifest through the Prophets and 
Apostles of God who have addressed 
us during the " t rious meetings of this 
Conference. And I feel that, so far, 
it has been t<> me one of the best Con- 
ferences that it has been my privilege 
to attend, because of the plain manner 
in which our duties have been made 
manifest to us as a people. And 1 
felt, when listening to our venerable 
President Woodruff in his testimony 
regarding the financial condition of 
this Church, that I would not only my- 
self endeavor to do my duty and pay 
my tithes and offerings, but that 1 
would use my influence with those 
whom I associate with in the Stake 
where my labor calls me, to get others 
to do likewise. For I believe it to be 
a veritable truth that if we as a people 
would draw near unto the Lord and 
observe the commandments that He 
has given to us more strictly, greater- 
prosperity would attend our efforts, 
and we would become free from the 
thraldom of debt with which we are 
ait the present time oppressed. 

I am satisfied that this work with 
which we have become identified, is "the 
power of God unto salvation" to all 
who will render obedience to its re- 
quirements, and that it is destined in 
the due time of the Lord to revolution- 
ize the whole world and bring man- 
kind generally into a condition when 
"every knee will bow and every tongue 
confess that Jesus is the Christ," to 
the honor and glory of God our eternal 
Father. 

At the time of the dedication of 
the Salt Lake Temple, I remember 
with a great deal of pleasure the prom- 
ises that were made to the people by 
President Woodruff, that if we would 
go forth from that time and seek to 
keep the commandments of God, and 
conform our lives to the requirements 
of the Gospel, that our sins as a people 
though as scarlet should become as 



ELDER DAVID H. CANNOA.

white as wool, and that we should be 
free to serve God, and have greater 
influence in the midst of the nations 
of the earth, and that the persecution 
that is being brought to bear upon the 
people would cease. I say I remember 
these predictions with a great deal of 
pleasure; and I have watched with 
equal satisfaction the fulfillment of 
every prediction that was ever made to 
the people. Wherever we have gone forth 
laboring to promote righteousness in 
the earth, God has blessed our labors, 
and His Spirit has attended His people 
in their undertakings. His servants 
have gone forth to the nations and 
have had influence and power wher- 
ever they have traveled, to an extent 
that was never before experienced 
since the organization of the Church 
upon the earth. And if the Saints con- 
tinue to improve in their lives, as a 
people, this Spirit will continue to in- 
crease, and more success will attend 
the preaching of the Gospel. 

I notice in traveling among the 
Saints and in our experience in the 
Temple, in the House of God, at St. 
George, where my labors are more 
particularly known, that there is a 
great improvement in the people with 
regard to the work that is necessary 
for the redemption of their kindred 
dead. Many more people are coming 
to the House of the Lord. Many there 
are that are desirous of obtaining their 
genealogical records, that they may be 
able to perform the work necessary 
for the redemption of their kindred 
dead. The spirit of this labor, I be- 
lieve, is increasing throughout the 
Stakes of Zion, as also in the nations 
of the earth. And, while I do not be- 
lieve that it is proper for us as a peo- 
ple to turn our attention exclusively 
to any one direction, to carry out one 
branch or one part of the Gospel, yet 
I believe that as a people we need to 
disturb ourselves a little in regard to 
this vicarious labor. I have said very 
many times, when addressing the peo- 
ple, that I do not know what the 
Saints would do if called from mor- 
tality and permitted to meet their 
kindred who have preceded them to 
the spirit world, I do not know what 
excuse they could offer for not having 
done more for the amelioration of their 
condition; because, in many instances, 



these people have lived within the 
shadow of the Temple, in close prox- 
imity with the House of God. The 
people have been reminded of their 
tithes and offerings wherein the 
Saints could place blessings and en- 
dowments in the Holy Priesthood in the 
hands of the kindred dead, and some 
have been perfectly indifferent in re- 
gard to this matter. In many instances 
men and women Who have consider- 
able of their genealogies have failed 
to go into the Temple to do the neces- 
sary work. There are other instances 
where they have done all that they 
could do. To these I have nothing to 
say, but to the ones that have failed, 
and who do not attend to anything In 
this line. I have been wondering what 
these would say if they should be sum- 
moned to the presence of their friends 
in the spirit world. We believe that 
we have identified ourselves with the 
Gospel of the Son of God. We be- 
lieve that it is necssary for a 
man or woman, in order to be 
eternally saved in the presence 
of our God, to go down into the water 
and be baptized for the remission of 
their sins; then receive the imposition 
of the hands of the servants of the 
Lord, for the reception of the Holy 
Ghost; and all that is necessary to 
save a person in immortality in the 
Celestial Kingdom of our Father, is 
equally necessary for those who have 
died without a knowledge of the pre- 
cious principles with which you and I 
have become so familiar. And if the 
Elder who goes forth to the nations of 
the earth experiences joy in meeting 
those that he has had the privilege 
of conductine into the waters of bap- 
tism, I say if he experiences joy at 
reaching them, how much more joy will 
he experience when he meets those indi- 
viduals into whose hands he has placed 
keys of power and Priesthood that will 
enable them to pass from their present 
condition into the presence of the Fa- 
ther and partake of glory and immor- 
tality in His Celestial Kingdom; not 
only going down into the waters and 
being baptized for the individual who 
is unable to receive this ordinance for 
himself or herself, but coming up out of 
the water and receiving the laying on 
of hands for the reception of the Holy 
Ghost, and if it be a brother of suffi-

X/ A' //. CONFERENCE. 



cient age, receiving the Holy Priesthood 
for him, and then all the other bless- 
ings that are necessary for him to en- 
Joy. I say that If an Individual has joy 
In meeting them, what joy will they 
have when they meet the Individual 
who performed all the ordi- 
nances that saved them, doing the work 
for them vicariously. I cannot think of 
anything that would be of greater joy 
to the person when he meets his friend 
than this labor would afford. Then we 
have the simpler ordinances, that we 
term simple because they are so easy 
of accomplishment, by which they can 
have sealed husband and wife for time 
and all eternity, and have conferred 
upon them the privilege of coming forth 
in the morning of the first resurrection, 
clothed with glory, immortality and 
eternal life and all the blessings of 
Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and all the 
other blessings that pertain to the new 
and everlasting covenant. Then if they 
have had children and the children have 
passed away without a knowledge of 
the Gospel, they gather the names and 
do the work that is necessary for them, 
and seal the children to the parents, 
and this is the work that was spoken of 
and looked forth to, when the Prophet 
Elijah should come to turn the hearts 
of the children to the fathers, and the 
hearts of the fathers to the children. 
Now, this is why the Latter-day Saints 
build temples: They are calculated to 
exalt us in the Celestial Kingdom of 
our God. But there are labors 
for us to perform which should oc- 
cupy every moment of time that we 
have to spare, going forth and labor- 
ing in whatever capacity we may be 
called upon to labor. And as the Lord 
blesses our labors, we should take a 
tenth of that which we receive and pay 
it to the storehouse of the Lord; then 
pay our fast offerings, that there may 
be plenty in the hands of the Bishop 
to provide for the wants of the poor 
in the ward where we reside; then go- 
ing forth and performing every duty 
that is necessary for us to perform. 
If there is anything that has caused, 
my heart to rejoice in my labors in 
connection with this people, my breth- 
ren and sisters, it is the provision that 
God our Father has made for the re- 
demption of mankind, both living and 
dead, and the opportunities that are 



afforded the people, those who are so 
disposed, of laboring to bring about 
His purposes upon the earth, assisting 
in accomplishing that which is neces- 
sary to firmly establish this Gospel in 
the earth. And if we do, as a people, 
all that is necessary for us to do, that 
is in our power, the heavens will be 
opened and the blessing of the Al- 
mighty will descend upon us, prosper- 
ity will atend all our labors, and we 
will have that peace of mind and that 
contentment and joy in contemplating 
the great plan God has instituted for 
the redemption of the people. I say 
we will have such joy in contemplat- 
ing these things that will make us so 
happy that we will never regret labor- 
ing for Him and for His purposes In 
the earth. 

May God bless you, and may we as 
a people ever remember the import- 
ance of the age in which we live, and 
not lose sight of the signs of the times 
in which we live, and may be per- 
form our duties to His acceptance, 
through Christ our Lord. Amen. 

At the close of Elder Cannon's re- 
marks the general authorities of the 
Church were presented by Elder Sey- 
mour B. Young, and sustaind by unan- 
imous vote. 

ELDER SEYMOUR B. YOUNG. 

My brethren and sisters, I see in this 
assembly a large body of our Seventies, 
whom I am very glad to welcome to 
our General Conference. 

Some four or five weeks ago and also 
a month previous to that date, we 
published an invitation for the Seven- 
ties to meet with us in this hall, on 
Sunday,the 10th inst.,at 2 o'clock p.m. 
And I find that very many of the 
Seventies have come to accept of the 
invitation, and are here this afternoon. 

Yesterday the First Presidency ad- 
vised us not to make of it an exclu- 
sively Seventies' meeting.but to have it 
an overflow meeting as usual, for the 
benefit of all the Saints that might 
wish to assemble. Consequently their 
suggestion was the keynote to us, and 
we cheerfully and gladly adopt the 
counsel they gave us on this matter. 
But I believe that there was nothing 
in their minds to prevent us from 



ELDER SEYMOUR B. YOUNG. 



73 



saying whatever we considered neces- 
sary to say to our brethren of the 
Seventies who should assemble here 
today. 

Then, by way of conveying some of 
our wishes to the Seventies that are 
scattered through all the Stakes of 
Zion, we wish to remind you that we 
have 1,700 brethren, and nearly all of 
those are Seventies, laboring in the 
ministerial field today as missionaries 
of the Church of Jesus Christ. They 
are laboring in all the states of 
the Union, they are also laboring 
in all the Scandinavian countries, that 
Is, in Denmark, Sweden and Norway, 
also in Germany and in Holland, or 
the Netherlands; also a small corps of 
missionaries are now laboring in the 
Holy Land, under the direction of 
Apostle Anton H. Lund. We have 
a large corps of missionaries in the 
British mission, and upon the Sandwich 
Islands, upon the Society Islands, up- 
on the Samoan Islands, in New Zea- 
land, in Australia and pretty much in 
all the civilized world wherever Chris- 
tian nations are known, and wherever 
Christianity is preached. "We have 
missions in all those lands and islands 
of the seas representing the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
We hope that our brethren of the 
Seventies have become impressed with 
the fact that they, to a large extent, 
are the missionary corps of the Church, 
and from these quorums of Seventies 
the brethren are chosen who go out 
on missions; or if they are chosen from 
the Elders' quorums, when they are 
sent forth they are ordained Seventies, 
and sent with the Gospel message to 
the nations of the earth — as minute 
men, calling upon the people of the 
world to repent of their sins. We have 
some very excellent missionaries in 
the field today. But we want to im- 
press upon the minds of our brethren 
who preside over these quorums and 
those who are members of the same, 
and also upon the minds of the Elders 
the necessity of us all preparing 
ourselves to be better missionaries in 
the future than we have been able to 
send out in the past. We desire an 
improvement all the time. We desire 
that our brethren should be imbued 
with the spirit of improvement, and 
that in every Elder and Seventy that 
is called out, the Presidency of the 



Church and the Apostles shall find 
a fit representative of the Church of 
Christ, and a man that knows the hope 
that is within him and can give a 
reason for that hope in good, intelli- 
gent English language, or in what- 
ever language he may be called upon 
to teach the Gospel, and that will de- 
pend upon the nation or people to 
whom he is sent. Now, in connection 
with this, I want to suggest to my 
Danish, Swedish, Norwegian and Ger- 
man brethren, and brethren from the 
islands of the sea, that you maintain 
the gift and power of speaking you: 
own native tongue or language in 
your family circles. And those who 
can speak German, Danish, Swedish, 
Norwegian or French and who are na- 
tives of these countries, that every one 
will maintain their native tongue 
and dialect, speak it in the family cir- 
cles and train their children to speak 
the same as well as the English, so 
that when they are called and sent out 
our young Elders may be prepared to 
preach and teach immediately, and 
thus gain an advantage in time, and 
time saved is expense saved. And 
those Elders who come from foreign 
missions and who have been in the 
habit of speaking foreign languages, 
by all means take every opportunity to 
speak in those languages that you may 
maintain the knowledge you have 
gained while you have been in a for- 
eign nation, and continue to be able 
to speak fluently those different dia- 
lects and tongues, that when you are 
again called you will be prepared to 
go immediately into the field and labor 
as efficient Elders, having a thorough 
knowledge of the language in which 
you are called to teach. We also wish 
our Seventies and Elders to learn all 
they can, to make themselves pro- 
ficient by attending to their Mutual 
Improvement Associations, and their 
Sunday schools, for in both of these 
institutions are to be found wonderful 
facilities for learning the principles 
of the Gospel, that they may be able 
to give a reason intelligently for the 
hopes that are within them. As I 
have said before, mutual improvement 
and individual improvement are the or- 
der of the day. 

Now, in regard to dealing with mem- 
bers of quorums who are careless or 
delinquent: There was a brother came 



74 



< 1ENKRAL CONFERENCE. 



to me today und presented his recom- 
mendation from a quorum in the south, 
also his genealogy, which was taken 
from the quorum record, and he stated 
that he had been Identified with no 
quorum since leaving the south, and 
that was as much as eight or ten 
years ago. He said. "I have been very 
careless, but I hope the brethren will 
not cast me off. I have been a wan- 
derer, a trader, a stock man, and I 
have been wandering around all over 
creation and not attending to my 
duties as a Seventy during all that 
time: yet I would like very much to be 
received into a quorum, where I am 
going to locate, and I would not like 
to be cast out from the midst of my 
brethren." I said, "Brother, there 
are no persons that I have ever met that 
were too old to repent of their sins, of 
their baekslidings, careless ways and 
to turn over a new leaf, serve the 
Lord and keep His commandments. If 
you are one of those who desire to do 
this you can certainly receive the 
benefit of your good resolutions; and 
if you will prove to your brethren that 
you are indeed repentant and that you 
will do better, they will have no desire 
to cast you off." The Gospel of life 
and salvation is a Gospel of repent- 
ance. Jesus truly said, when Peter 
asked Him how many times we should 
forgive our erring brother, and said as 
a suggestion, shall we forgive him 
seven times? Jesus said to him, not 
only shall you forgive him seven times, 
but you shall forgive him seventy 
times seven, if he repent. Now, this 
is a wide latitude, and I am not re- 
sponsible for it; but I am satisfied in 
this matter that it is a very great and 
inestimable favor and blessing that 
the Lord has given unto His children, 
that as often as they will repent and 
forsake their sins, He will f -rgive 
them. We all need to repent every 
day of our lives, and we all need Ibe 
spirit of repentance, and we all ought 
to cultivate this spirit r»f forgiveness 
one to another. For the Lord has 
said, "If you forgive not each other his 
trespasses, the Lord will not forgive 
you your trespa^se-i.' Now, In deal- 
ing with scattered and careless mem- 
bers of Seventies, we dtsire, as we 
have ir.strurt.il nr b ethr^n y ihe 
presidency of these quorums, that these 
brethren shall be labored with, that 



they shall be sought after, that they 
shall be earnestly taught with hu- 
mility and kindness the way of life, 
that they shall be admonished from 
time to time in the quorum meetings. 
If you cannot get them to act with you, 
go to them and meet with them in 
their own houses and labor with them 
by their own firesides in the spirit of 
meekness and love unfeigned, seeking 
their welfare and salvation, and only 
desiring that through their repentance 
they may be forgiven, and learn to lay 
hold of the spirit of the Gospel. 

There has been very much said dur- 
ing this Conference regarding the way 
that we show our determination to be 
in accord with our brethren, to be in 
unison with them, to be united with 
them in every good word and in every 
good work. And who has not felt his 
heart or her heart burn within his 
bosom during the services of this great 
Conference, in listening to the voice of 
our President, Wilford Woodruff, and 
hearing his admonitions? He stands 
a living monument of God's mercy 
and pleasure in preserving his life 
and keeping a living witness within 
his breast of the truths of the Gospel 
that he embraced when in the days of 
his youth; always maintaining that 
same living witness that the same 
light burned brightly, for it has never 
gone out of his heart for one moment 
since he received it. See what a wit- 
ness and testimony he has borne of 
these facts to the people during this 
Conference. I say never for one 
moment has the light gone out of his 
heart, and I do not think it has ever 
burned dimly; for the power of God 
has been manifest in him from that 
day and hour unto the present time. 
See the watch-care of the Spirit of the 
Lord and of the holy angels of God's 
presence, how they have been over 
that man and guarded him and pre- 
served him to do the work that he is 
called upon to do at this stage and in 
this age of the Church. And so I be- 
lieve we might testify of those associ- 
ated with him — his Counselors and the 
Twelve Apostles, today. They have 
shown by their works, labors, teach- 
ings and constant endeavors among 
the people to lead, guide, counsel and 
admonish in all meekness and in all 
humility and by the power of God 
manifested to them, that their lamps

have never grown dim, but that the 
Spirit of the Lord has burned within 
their hearts all the time; and there is 
burning within their hearts today a de- 
sire for the welfare of Israel, a de- 
sire for the gathering of Israel, a de- 
sire that the Gospel may be preached 
in every land and that the chosen seed 
of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob may be 
gathered from all the nations whither 
they have been scattered. Now, this 
is the course they are taking.and what 
ought we to do, my brethren and sis- 
ters, and especially my brethren of 
the Seventies and Elders, what ought 
to be our course in life? Should we 
not possess in our hearts the same 
light and the same love of truth that 
they have evidenced, and should we 
not stand shoulder to shoulder with 
them and be united in all things with 
our brethren who preside over us, 
seeking diligently to know the mind 
and will of the Lord, and be led by 
that Spirit which comes from Him all 
the time, into the way of life and 
truth, making our words and actions 
agree entirely? And when we testify 
that we have received the Gospel, that 
we have a living witness in our hearts, 
should we not keep that lamp constant- 
ly and brightly burning, that it may 
never grow dim through carelessness 
on our part? 

I wish to remind you today, my 
brethren of the Seventies, that there is 
a very great necessity for every one, 
every president and member of these 
quorums to be united together and to be 
ready for the word of counsel from our 
file leaders all the time, and to prepare 
ourselves for any field of action or 
labor, or any duty that we may be 
called upon to perform. Let us re- 
member another thing, that though 
we may be called upon to perform 
some political duty or labors that are 
secular and not connected with our 
calling as Seventies, this should not 
take us outside of the influence of the 
Church nor of the brethren who pre- 
side over us. "We should be subject 
to the laws of the Lord, to the law of 
the Gospel, which means a determina- 
tion to carry out all the requirements 
made of us and to perform every duty 
as servants of the Lord. Let us feel 
that we are in duty bound to so con- 
duct our lives that no reproach may 



come to us, and that we shall not bar 
ourselves from having the light, even 
the lamp of the Holy Spirit constantly 
burning within our hearts. I felt 
called to make these remarks, for I 
have seen with some sorrow, recently, 
that some of our brethren who are in 
political positions have turned a deaf 
ear to the admonitons of their brethren, 
and who have seemingly put at de- 
fiance every wish or suggestion that 
might be made to them. And I want 
to raise my voice in admonition to my 
brethren about the matter, and to call 
the attention of the Latter-day Saints, 
one and all, to the fact that we owe 
allegiance to our heavenly Father, 
and that between us and Him stand 
our brethren who preside over us, and 
that if we wish to maintain an in- 
fluence with God and with the heavens, 
we must subject ourselves to the coun- 
sel of our leaders, and labor diligently 
and faithfully in the cause of Christ. 
May the Lord bless us and help us to 
do good, is my prayer in the name of 
Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER JONATHAN G. KIMBALL. 

I pray the Lord that I may be wise 
in what I shall say, and be under the 
influence of the Spirit of the Lord; for 
I have no desire to express my own 
feelings. 

I frankly confess that I am disap- 
pointed; and when I am disappointed 
you find it out, for it shows upon the 
very lineaments of my face. I am not 
like a brother I once had — and he was 
the only one I ever did have like that 
— when he was disappointed and felt 
badly, he could whistle and sing. 1 
cannot whistle or sing when I feel dis- 
appointed. 

I have not learned the lesson of obe- 
dience yet, but I shall before I get 
through. It is our duty when we are 
confronted with anything that we do 
not understand, or go against any ob- 
struction, to plow around it. I have 
always been accustomed to going over 
it. If I ran against a snag when plow- 
ing, it did me a whole lot of good to 
see my team pull, to test the plow and 
see how good it was. I have broken 
many a plow and done considerable 
damage by not plowing around the ob- 
stacle.

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



There is an animal that when It 
reaches out with its feelers and runs 
against anything, it pulls Its feelers 
hack and crawls Into Its shell, and I 
suppose remains there and reflects until 
the scene changes. 

Now, we were very desirous of meet- 
ing with the Seventies in a special con- 
ference meeting. We are not deprived 
of the privilege of talking to them as 
It Is; for the brethren of the authori- 
ties have seemingly reconsidered the 
previous arrangements we made. It 
was with their consent, (I desire that 
fully understood by the Seventies), and 
their full approval that this notice was 
sent to you to be here, at 2 p. m. today. 
Out of it great good has come, because 
hundreds of Seventies would not have 
been here had it n^t been for the no- 
tice. Some have come long distances 
and they have been fully rewarded by 
what they have heard. If they will 
follow out the counsels that have been 
given to them by the Presidency of this 
Church, and by the Apostles, they need 
no further instructions from us, be- 
cause when they return to their homes 
they will not neglect their duties a* 
Latter-day Saints. You know, we 
should be like clay in the hands of the 
potter. We have got to be ground, 
moulded and fashioned into a vessel 
of honor. And a great many of us are 
lumpy, although some of these old 
Seventies have been ground for sixty 
years. It has taken a long time to 
grind them, so that they will become 
tractable like little children. It will 
take just as long, perhaps, to grind ah 
the lumps out of me, and other young 
men. 

I have a testimony that the Gospel 
is true. I can preach it a great deal 
better than I can live it. Under the 
influence of the Spirit of God men of- 
ten say things that are a marvel to 
them. "Sudden strokes of ideas" come 
to them when they stand upon theii 
feet that they never thought of before. 
It may be very sudden and brief; but 
every man that has spoken under that 
Spirit knows there is such a thing as 
the Holy Ghost; that is, the Spirit of 
inspiration and revelation. That is 
the lesson that we have to learn. 1 
often think of our Elders that you have 
sent out into the world. Many of 
them were wayward, careless, and in- 
different; their parents were unable 



to touch their hearts in some instances. 
They seemed determined to have their 
own way, even though it be a bad way. 
When a father or mother said anything 
to them about their bad associations, 
they would not believe it. I have done 
so myself when I was wayward, and 
when my mother counseled me that 
those young men were not proper as- 
sociates for me, I could not believe it. 
I sympathize with a young man that 
has had bad companions and improp- 
er associates. Yet, when those young 
men repent of their sins, and get a 
glimmering of the spirit of the Gospel, 
they are just like clay in the hands of 
the potter. And, as one of the Apostles 
that has lately visited the Southern 
States stated to me, that when he com- 
pared what he saw in the South with 
what he had seen at home, the South- 
ern mission grows bigger and larger 
every day. Yes, and it will keep grow- 
ing larger, too. It is not the only 
mission on the earth either, for they 
are all growing larger. 

Now about your boys. I have la- 
bored among the Elders who are work- 
ing in the South and I have never seen 
the time in my Ave years' experience 
there, that Elders have rebelled against 
the counsel that was given them. They 
sometimes put their own interpretation 
upon that counsel, but always acted 
to the best of their ability. When a 
man does that, he does pretty well; he 
is trying to do right and to carry out 
the instructions. I never had a diffi- 
culty in the South with an Elder, ex- 
cepting one. He told the people things 
that never did transpire and never 
will. That was the only time I had 
occasion to say a harsh word and to 
correct an Elder. I have never felt 
the Spirit so manifest at home as 1 
have when surrounded by our Elders 
in council meetings in the mission 
fields. It is often asked, Wbat are 
they doing in the South? I speak of it 
because I am familiar with that mis- 
sion. I am familiar with the workings 
of the South. There are few men as 
familiar with the Southern States mis- 
sion as I am; because I have been in 
touch with it almost constantly for the 
last seven years. We find they are 
trying to educate your five hundred El- 
ders to pay their tithing, and it is sur- 
prising how people criticise the Presi- 
dent of that mission on that subject. 



JO A A THAN G. KIMBALL. 



If some of the kind people are moved 
upon by the Spirit to give your sons 
money, they pay their tithing, and it is 
sent to Chattanooga. And you will 
find every one of these Elders' names 
upon the tithing records. They paid 
a large tithing last year. The Lord 
will open the way before the Elders. 
They will not suffer in the South. They 
are treated like kings. What is the 
reason? They have struck the key 
note, and I hope they have struck it 
everywhere in the world, and that is, 
to pray, fast, travel without purse and 
scrip, pay their tithing, and climb out 
of old ruts. I heard that a missionary 
committee of brethren have been ap- 
pointed to counsel with the brethren ot 
the authorities, so that the European 
mission can be placed on a higher plat- 
form. It makes my heart rejoice. I 
wish they would take the headquarters 
in Liverpool and place it on a hill some- 
where, that it may be seen. I pray 
the Lord to move upon His Elders that 
they may reach a higher standard ot 
perfection. God intended His people 
to be progressive, and He never in- 
tended them to locate themselves in 
the slums of the world. And I told 
the Elders laboring in the South so. 
God does not ask you to go in the 
slums and remain over night, getting 
contagious skin diseases that are 
prevalent in such places. You can 
visit them, but I ask of you Elders, 
to go in respectable places when upon 
your missions, for you are servants ot 
God. And if people do not keep them- 
selves clean they are unworthy to have 
our Elders sleep in their beds. I would 
rather rest in the woods. Our Elders, 
through their great kindness, have 
brought upon themselves skin diseases 
that have afflicted them for years and 
years, and the Lord does not require 
it. The Holy Ghost will not dwell in 
unclean tabernacles, nor in unclean 
places. 

I desire to tell you how the South 
got out of trouble. Tou know the diffi- 
culties that Elder John Morgan coped 
with. And let me say here, that man 
laid a broad foundation, and no man 
can take the honor from him, because 
it is his, through his faith, persever- 
ance and the blessings of the Lord. He 
worked under great difficulties, that 
very few men in this Church have met 



with, except the early Apostles and the 
men who commenced this work. He 
went to the South in abject poverty, 
and he made railroad officials his 
friends, and he built up a reputation 
for honesty that can never be shaken. 
He made business men his friends, 
from which associations all his suc- 
cessors have received benefit. The Chat- 
tanooga Times, in 1884, when bitterness 
was at its highest ebb, said, to shake 
the hand of John Morgan was to be 
his friend. I was introduced to a pas- 
senger agent at Memphis, Tenn., by 
the general passenger agent of the East 
Tennessee railway, and he said, "I can 
give you no better recommend of Mr.. 
Kimball than to say, if he applied to 
me for one thousand railroad tickets to 
Salt Lake City, and had no money with 
him to pay the same, I would feel per- 
fectly secure in letting him have them." 
This is the reputation John Morgan 
established in the South. His succes- 
sors have followed in his wake. 

The Latter-day Saints do not fully 
comprehend the persecution, hardships 
and difficulties Elders Morgan, Roberts 
and Spry had to meet. They and the 
Elders laboring under their direction 
were hounded, hunted, whipped, shot 
at, and some were killed. I stand be- 
fore you as a living witness of these 
things. 

I was in the South on my first mis- 
sion in the year 1884, and it was the 
dark period in the life of the mission. 
Hardly a day passed, that letters were 
not received at the office at Chatta- 
nooga, stating that Elders had been 
threatened, whipped or surrounded by 
mobs, and Elders would ask if they 
should hold the fort. All that could 
be said was as Jesus had stated, 
"When they persecute you in one place, 
flee ye to another." 

The Lord, through His servant, the 
Prophet Wilford Woodruff, told you 
Latter-day Saints, at the time that 
great Temple [pointing to the Temple) 
was being dedicated, that the bitter- 
ness would be taken out of the hearts 
of our enemies, and their hearts would 
be softened towards us. 

The Elders who were laboring in the 
South at the time of the dedication, 
and there were 160 of them, testify that 
a very marked and radical change has. 
taken place in their experience, for the 



78 



<;/ \ AAV//, CONFERENCE. 



wmds of the Prophet are being ful- 
filled. 

Some Elders now laboring In the 
South fancy tli.y arc the only ones 
who ever traveled without money. El- 
ders were never more faithful, ener- 
getic ami persevering than at present, 
yet thousands of Elders have been just 
as true and faithful. 

I tilled my first mission, and thought 
money was an essential, which to some 
Elders it Is, yet the only time I laid 
out in the woods was with a $10 bill in 
my pocket and I thanked the Lord 
when the money was gone. 

Brethren and sisters, cease yout 
severe criticisms of the Presidents or 
missions. Stop finding fault, and re- 
frain from troubling Elders about their 
returning home. They are being edu- 
cated in the Gospel, and being taught 
to obey the laws of the Lord, that 
seemingly cannot reach their hearts 
at home. And this rewards them for 
all sacrifices. Our sons are there be- 
ing taught to obey the law of tithing. 
Some of our good brethren's names 
would not be found on the tithing rec- 
ords if their wives did not pay tithing 
on egers and butter. 

In conclusion, I desire to state that 
I feel well and honor and respect men 
who love God and keep His command- 
ments; men who are truthful, honest 
and do not fear men. I love great 
generals and leaders like Moses, a man 
who loved God, and followed His coun- 
sel, yet was not afraid to express his 
views. The Lord loved him because 
of his manhood, and loyalty to Hia 
people. 

I desire to say to you, Seventies, and 
the Latter-day Saint" the closer I get 
to the Presidency of the Church and 
Twelve Apostles, the more I love them, 
because I know they are kind men, and 
they love God, and they love His work 
and His people. That is my testimo- 
ny. If you have feelings against the 
brethren, go to them. If your brothei- 
offends you, go to him. Try to fix 
things up and do not let us have jar- 
rings and bitterness, do not let us have 
apostasy in our hearts. God bless you. 
Amen. 

ELDER MARRINER W MERRILL. 

I wish to say a few woris in testi- 
mony, relative to what President Sey- 



mour B. Young referred to To my 
mind what he referred to is quite an 
important matter: With regard to the 
foreign people, the Scandianvian, Ger- 
man, French and every people who 
speak foreign languages, teaching 
their children to speak the niothir 
tongue, to speak the foreign lmguage 
that the fathers and mothers are ac- 
quainted with. In some instances 
where the mother is acquaintej with 
the foreign language and ..he father is 
not, or the father is acquainted and 
the mother is not, a great d-;al of pains 
should be exercised by th ? parents in 
teaching their children their language. 
We are sending Elders to different 
parts of the world; and a grftat major- 
ity of our Elders, I believe, have to 
learn a foreign language, if they ar<J 
sent to a foreign country. This should 
be measurably avoided in the future, 
because our foreign popularion is scat- 
tered all over the country. » r e have a 
great many Scandinavian and German 
people in the country and I am sorry 
to say that a good many of. those peo- 
ple who emigrated here a number of 
years ago have utterly failed to teach 
their children their own language. 1 
had occasion a short time ago to look 
for some missionaries to go to Sweden, 
Norway and Denmark, and. of course, 
among that class of people I expected 
to find young people able to speak their 
mother tongue, but in this I was sadly 
disappointed. I only found a very few 
that could speak their mother tongue. 
In no case did I find any one that was 
reared up and born here and of foreign 
parentage, that could read the lan- 
guage. Now, I think this is a great 
mistake. The children may just as 
well learn two languages as to only 
learn one, and they can do it quite 
readily when they aie young. I re- 
member marrying a couple, I think it 
is about thirteen or fourteen years ago; 
the brother was an American and the 
sister a Swedish lady, and she could 
talk English very fluently, as also the 
Swedish language. When they came 
to get married, I asked them if they 
would promise me, should they be 
blessed with children, that they would 
teach those children the mother tongue, 
that is, teach them the Swedish lan- 
guage. Of course the brother could 
not speak that language. They 
promised me that they would. 



ELDER MARRINER W. MERRILL. 



79 



and I took occasion to visit them 
about six weeks ago, and after 
hunting them up I went into the house 
to renew acquaintance. Of course they 
knew me, but I would not have known 
them. I asked them about it, and the 
mother said, "Yes, we have four chil- 
dren," they had lost one or two, 'and 
every one of these can now talk 
Swedish to you, if you can understand 
them." They brought those children to 
talk and sing for me, and the little 
children were quite young, the oldest 
being about twelve years old, or nearly 
so. The mother said they talked very 
correctly. Of course 1 could not Judge 
as to that, but suffice it to say they 
could talk their mother tongue; and 
that sister carried out and kept the 
promise they had made, to the very 
letter. The father comes in and takes 
the little girl on his knee, but he does 
not know a word she says. I was very 
much pleased in listening to thsse chil- 
dren talk their mother tongue. Now 
this will apply to all the foreign broth- 
ers and sisters. You brethren that have 
been to Germany, do not forget the 
German language, the language that 
you have so studiously acquired when 
you were preaching the Gospel. Now, 
the German people are quite numerous 
in this State, and every one of them 
ought to take greater pains in teaching 
their boys their own language. Now, 
Brother Young referred to this, and I 
thought you were not impressed with 
the idea so fully as you ought to be 
with regard to this important matter, 
for I tell you it is important. There 
was a young man raised by the side of 
me and his family lived by the side of 
me for forty years; they had a family 
of boys, and they were good boys too, 
Both father and mother were Norwe- 
gian. A little while ago one of the 
boys was sent to Norway on a mission, 
and it was with a great deal of diffi- 
culty that he learned the language. 
He had not learned it at home and did 
not make a success learning it on his 
mission, did not make a success learn- 
ing his mother tongue. Now, if you 
take children in their infancy you can 
soon teach them a foreign language. 
Talk in that language to the baby and 
it will soon learn what you are talking 
about. Now, this thing ought to be ob- 
served throughout the whole Church. 
We are here to preach the Gospel to all 



people, nations, kindreds, tongues and 
tribes. If we can learn the language 
here at home, how much better it is 
than to spend months when you go 
abroad to learn the foreign language. 
You people that know the French lan- 
guage ought to cultivate it and not for- 
get it, but practice, talk and read it. 
The Germans ought to read their lan- 
guage and have the children read it, 
and so with the Scandinavian people. 
They ought to have books and teach 
the children to read the language as 
well as to speak it. It is one thing to 
read it and another thing to speak it. 
It is not everybody that can speak it 
that can read it correctly. We ought 
to take these matters into considera- 
tion. I think we have time to devote 
to this important matter. Now I think 
that is enough. 

I want to say something in relation 
to what Brother David H. Cannon, 
President of the St. George Temple, 
said. 

Temple work has been my theme and 
labor for a great many years, and, of 
course, those subjects naturally im- 
press themselves upon my mind. It is 
a very important matter, laboring in 
the interest of our kindred dead. We 
feel sometimes that we have done a 
great amount of labor in the Temple. 
We have four Temples now in opera- 
tion, and they are open most of the 
year, and people are going there, but 
we are just commencing now; we will 
continue during our life time to work 
here, and the life time of our children, 
and the life time of our children's 
children, and then through the Millen- 
nium, and how much longer I am not 
prepared to say, but suffice it to say 
the work will go on and continue to 
go on during these periods. Now, I 
suppose there are people here in this 
congregation that have almost lived 
under the shadow of some Temple, and 
have done nothing. You are liable, as 
well as myself, to be called to the other 
side to meet your children and relatives 
that have died without the Gospel, and 
who will, no doubt — no question in my 
mind — receive the Gospel if we will give 
them the opportunity. 

Now I want to exhort you, my breth- 
ren and sisters, to consider these mat- 
ters more seriously. Remember the 
obligations to your ancestors. If it had 
not been for them, you and I would

not have nn existence. Remember our 
kindred, and our fathers, and see to it 
that the hearts <>f the fathers are 
turned to the children and the hearts 
of the children are turned to the fath- 
ers. God bless you. Amen.

ELDER FRANKLIN D. RICHARDS. 

Signs of the times— Fulfilment of prophecy — 
Spirit of war — Work for the dead. 

I have been requested to occupy a 
few moments of your precious time 
this afternoon. I greatly desire the 
sweet and enlightening influences of 
the Holy Spirit to direct what I shall 
say to you, that the time may be oc- 
cupied acceptably and profitably. I 
have been greatly edified in the in- 
structions that have been given from 
day to day during this protracted and 
exceedingly interesting Conference. 
A great deal has been brought for- 
ward for our consideration, deeply in- 
teresting, and should be exceedingly 
profitable unto us. 

We are living in times of momentous 
importance, times which are marvel- 
ously significant from every point of 
view in which we may consider the 
conditions of the human family at 
the present time, whether religiously 
or politically, or whatever view we 
may take of it. Jesus, when on the 
earth, informed His associates that 
in the latter times there should come 
many false Christs, and there would 
be a great deal of wars and rumors 
of wars in the earth, etc. This same 
Jesus, risen from the dead, and again 
speaking to His Prophet in the last 
days, has spoken to us more definitely 
and significantly upon this point than 
He did at that time to the brethren 
with Him. He was pleased to say to 
His Prophet, Joseph Smith, on the 25th 
day of December, 1832, the day cele- 
brated as the anniversary of the birth 
of Christ, that there should come wars 



ELDER FRANKLIN D. RICHARDS. 



in this land, and specifically stated 
that they should commence in the 
state of South Carolina. This revela- 
tion was preserved in the archives of 
the Church until July, 1851. Some 
nineteen years after this revelation 
was given to the Prophet Joseph it 
was brought out and published to the 
nations of the earth. Since then it has 
become common property to all the 
inhabitants of the earth who have been 
pleased to examine the revelations of 
God to the Latter-day Saints. It was 
stated that this was to be the com- 
mencement of wars that should cause 
the death and misery of many souls. 
It was not until 1861 — about ten years 
after this revelation was published — 
that this was fulfilled. And it was not 
done in a corner, nor in any obscure 
part of the earth, but it was fulfilled 
just as the Prophet said it should be. 
The first guns of that war were dis- 
charged at Fort Sumter, in Charleston 
harbor, South Carolina. It is now a 
matter of national history, and all 
the human family should know that 
it was given to Joseph Smith in 1832, 
some twenty-nine years before it oc- 
curred, and which cost this nation so 
much anguish and the lives of nearly 
a million of precious souls. 

This has come to pass, and the same 
Lord Jesus Christ has given us 
through the same Prophet Joseph 
Smith to understand that the day is 
near at hand when peace shall be taken 
from the earth, and that it has be- 
gun to be taken from the earth. These 
things have been read in our hearing 
during this Conference. Now, we may 
as well understand that as the other 
great revelation of 1832 was fulfilled, 
which the whole human family know 
who are of civilized or semi-civilized 
condition, just so certain is this also 
likely to be fulfilled. It furthermore 
states in the revelation that has been 
read to us, that the time will come 
when all nations shall be at war; when 
every man that will not take up his 
sword to defend himself against his 
neighbor will have to flee to Zion. 
These prophecies indicate a growing 
tendency in that direction. And I won- 
der if the latter part that I have just 
quoted is not already tasted in its 
bitterness in the island of Cuba near to 
our coast though they have not the 
chance to flee to Zion, but have to take 



up their sword against their neighbors 
and have to contend for their liberties, 
and are at the present time in a hor- 
ribly distressed condition, objects of 
the charity of the whole nation and of 
the other nations of the earth. 

Living then in times when these 
tremendous prophecies are hanging 
over the heads of the human family, 
partly fulfilled, partly unfulfilled, and 
when the angel of the Lord came with 
his message in these last days de- 
claring the Gospel revealed again and 
bringing especially the word, "the 
hour of his judgment is come,", shall 
we take no notice of these great and 
wonderfully significant sayings? The 
brethren who have ears to hear and 
hearts to understand, will feel the 
necessity of maintaining closer busi- 
ness relations than we have been in 
the habit of doing for the last decade 
to two. If we had hearkened to the 
good counsels that were given to us 
by our President, and made it a point, 
as they and the officers of our cities 
and counties did, to make once a year 
a clean sheet, and get no further into 
debt, we would have been in a much 
stronger business condition today 
than we now are, and many 
men would have saved them- 
selves sleepless hours who now 
have to lie awake to study how they 
are going to raise the money to meet 
their obligations and to save their 
homes from being taken away from 
them. 

We live in a time when the na- 
tions of all the earth are so disunitedly 
united that the tension of their con- 
nection is drawn to its utmost limit in 
many places. We need not only to 
notice the case here on our coast, but 
it is so on the other side of the globe. 
Nations are ready to go to war, and 
anxious for the opportunity. It seems 
as if the spirit of war had gone forth 
until great men who pose as patriots, 
and would like to be considered states- 
men, are ready and clamoring for war. 
Latter-day Saints have always taught 
the principles of peace and good will. 
This came to us through our Savior. 
But He told us that we were going to 
come to a time when we would have

families; when a man's enemies should 
be they of his own household — another

consummation that was before re- 
ferred to. The world are tending to 
that. But the Latter-day Saints are 
tending to peace, to union, to fellow- 
ship, and love. While in the midst of 
our deepest affliction, harrassed, tor- 
mented, scattered and peeled, and 
ooming here as far as we could get 
away from civilization to make a 
home. I say while we have been pass- 
ing through these things we have had 
a peace within us; we have a settled 
conviction of the knowledge of God; 
we know that He has accepted us as 
His children; we know that He has 
manifested himself to us frequently 
by gifts and blessings and manifesta- 
tions not a few. Thus have we been 
right along. And while we do not 
nor are we under any necessity to, 
make any great demonstration or in- 
dulge in any spread-eagle discourses 
to convince the people that we are at 
peace, and that we wish they would 
keep the peace, that has been the way 
we have felt. But the Lord has told 
us that Zion would be the only people 
on the earth that would be at peace 
in the earth. Therefore, we want to 
overcome evil with good, cultivate this 
spirit and the keeping of the command- 
ments of God, and get that spirit that 
Brother Joseph was talking to us of 
this morning, to know that we are 
born again, that His Spirit is in u,s, 
that we live by it and are guided by 
those principles; that it is the light 
that leadeth our feet, and we want to 
live so as to keep it growing brighter 
and brighter till the perfect day. 

Considering these are the times and 
conditions in which we live, it seems 
to me that the teachings we have had 
during this Conference have been 
wonderfully adapted to our condition, 
not only the spiritual portion, but the 
exhortation to the wise management 
of our temporal concerns. I would 
urge the brethren to make all reason- 
able effort to get out of debt, and 
live honest and honorable before all 
men. If you have but little, realize 
that that much comes as near being 
yours as anybody's, except the Lord's, 
who has made you the steward over 
it. 

We see then that the growth and 
tendency of all influences existing 
among the human family are towards 
discord, violence, warfare, contention 



and strife. The union that used to be 
felt among people in neighborhoods is 
being lost. The confidence of men 
with men is being lost. We hear it 
common among the people that we 
must treat every man in that way 
that we do not know but he may turn 
to be dishonest. 

Now, in the light of the great work 
that is going on, we want to cultivate 
every grace and virtue, and keep the 
commandments of God and the cove- 
rts we have made with each other. 
It is our integrity, our faithfulness, 
and our devotion to do these things 
and to walk in the law of the Lord, 
that we may have the light of His 
Spirit to increase with us constantly 
—it is this that is going to enable us 
to get through and accomplish the 
work that is laid upon us for our- 
selves and for our dead. I want to 
say that in our appointing the Elders 
to the nations we have an eye con- 
tinually to their efforts among their 
kindred in distant lands, and the ob- 
taining of the genealogy of their an- 
cestry, that they may labor for their 
dead. 

I know this is the work of the Lord. 
I sense it continually. The only thing 
that I have to concern myself about is 
to be able to live it, to be counted 
worthy of the multiplied blessings 
which He has bestowed upon us. In 
other lands people are dying by the 
hundreds and thousands, through 
famine and terrible diseases and pesti- 
lences, which are God's messengers 
sent forth to convince the people. As 
it was said to an ancient Prophet, 
when the judgments of the Lord were 
in the earth people would learn 
righteousness. Perhaps they will; but 
I am afraid it is going to be too late 
for the great mass of them, the way 
they act. It seems as if the human 
family were anxious to become drunk 
with blood and imbrue their hands in 
each other's blood. And what a work 
will it be when peace is taken from 
the earth! Let us cultivate peace. 
Let us walk in all the ways of the 
Lord and serve Him continually. 

I pray that the blessings of God may 
be upon all the interests of Zion; that 
the spirit of this Conference may go 
to the ends of the earth as far as 
there are Saints or honest in heart

that want to hear and to learn of it, 
that it may be a blessing and a benefit 
to us and to the human family; that 
the work of the Lord may go on and 
prosper, increase and spread abroad 
until the Gospel has gone to all na- 
tions, and until all the ends of the 
earth shall be made to know that He 
is God, and that there is none else in 
the earth like unto Him. And may 
His blessings be upon us, and upon 
all we have to do with — our persons, 
our, families, our flocks, our herds, 
our gardens and our orchards, and all 
that the Lord hath made us the stew- 
ards over, in the name of our Lord 
Jesus Christ. Amen.

Prophetic promises concerning the land of America 
and Its people— It is choice above all other lands 
— Designs of God in regard to it — Law in relation 
to war — Course of the government of our nation 
commended— Our duty to our country. 

The remarks which have been made 
by Brother Franklin D. Richards con- 
cerning the position the inhabitants 
of the earth are in, and particularly 
our position, and his reference to the 
revelation that was read the other 
day concerning the necessity there 
would be for those who desired peace 
to flee to Zion, suggests the reading 
of some promises and predictions that 
the Lord has made concerning this 
land. Lehi, before his death, in speak- 
ing about this land to which he and 
his family had been led, made the fol- 
lowing remarks: 

"Wherefore, this land is consecrated 
unto him whom he shall bring. And 
if it so be that they shall serve Him 
according to the commandment which 
he hath given, it shall be a land of 
liberty unto them; wherefore, they 
shall never be brought down 
into captivity; if so, it shall be because 
of iniquity; for if iniquity shall 
abound, cursed shall be the land for 
their sakes; but unto the righteous it 
shall be blessed for ever." 

His son Jacob also spoke concerning 
this land, and those who had charge 
of the records have left on record some- 
thing that He has said respecting it: 

"But behold, this land, saith God, 
shall be a land of thine inheritance, 
and the Gentiles shall be blessed upon 
the land. 

"And this land shall be a land of lib- 
erty unto the Gentiles, and there shall 



be no kings upon the land, who shall 
rise up unto the Gentiles; 

"And I will fortify this land against 
all other nations." 

Here is a promise given to the peo- 
ple of this land, that if we will serve 
the God of this land no nation shall 
prevail against us; for the Lord says 
he will fortify this land against all 
other nations. Of course, it is under- 
stood that to have this we must be a 
righteous nation. 

Other prophets have spoken in sim- 
ilar language. It is recorded by Mor- 
oni, in the book of Ether, as follows: 

"And now we can behold the decrees 
of God concerning this land, that it is 
a land of promise, and whatsoever 
nation shall possess it, shall serve God, 
or they shall be swept off when the ful- 
ness of his wrath shall come upon 
them. And the fulness of his wrath 
cometh upon them when they are 
ripened in iniquity; 

For behold, this is a land which is 
choice above all other lands; where- 
fore he that doth possess it shall serve 
God, or shall be swept off; for it is 
the everlasting decree of God. And it 
is not until the fulness of iniquity 
among the children of this land, that 
they are swept off. 

"And this cometh unto you, O ye 
Gentiles, that ye may know the de- 
crees of God, that ye may repent, and 
not continue in your iniquities until 
the fulness come, that ye may not 
bring down the fulness of the wrath 
of God upon you, as the inhabitants 
of the land hath hitherto done. 

"Behold, this is a choice land, and 
whatsoever nation shall possess it, 
shall be free from bondage, and from 
captivity, and from all other nations 
under heaven, if they will but serve 
the God of the land, who is Jesus 
Christ, who hath been manifested by 
the things which we have written." 

These are great promises which the 
Lord has given unto the inhabitants 
of this land; not to the Latter-day 
Saints alone, but to all the people of 
the land. You remember, no doubt, 
the effort that was made to establish 
a king on this land of North America, 
and the destruction which resulted to 
many of those who attempted it. The 
word of God as recorded in this Book 
of Mormon, which was revealed 
through the Prophet Joseph Smith, 



8 4 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



concerning the results of any attempt 
to set up a king on this land, was 
literally fulfilled In that instance. 
Mnximilllan was destroyed, and the 
attempt to establish an empire was 
brought to naught. The Mexican peo- 
ple, inspired wth a grand patriotism 
and an Intense love for country, rose 
up, led by a pure descendant of Lehi— 
a pure Lamanite— and overthrew the 
armies of Europe that were brought 
here to conquer the land and to es- 
tablish upon this sacred soil— this soil 
dedicated by the Almighty to liberty 
and freedom— an empire. The flower 
of the French army, and most dis- 
tinguished of her generals, with the 
Emperor Napoleon himself as the de- 
signer of the enterprise, backed and 
sustained by Austria, were ignomin- 
ious] y overthrown and brought to 
shame and confusion. The Lord ful- 
filled His word exactly as it had been 
predicted long before. Upwards of 
six hundred years before the birth of 
the Savior Ether, a Prophet of God, 
had made predictions concerning this 
land. Not long after that Lehi made 
similar predictions. Shortly after that 
Jacob, a Prophet of God, made pre- 
dictions concerning the fate of those 
who should attempt to bring the in- 
habitants of this land into bondage, 
and he said that no king should be 
established upon the land. So that we 
have on record great predictions by 
these three men of God concerning 
the future of America. This is a sa- 
cred land. It is a land choice above 
all other lands upon the face of the 
earth. It was kept hidden from the 
nations for long centuries, and the 
reason for this has been given to us; 
it was that the land might, not be over- 
run by the nations of the earth, and 
that it might be reserved for the great 
drama of the last days. 

It is a remarkable thing, and we 
would be incapable of understanding 
the reason why this land had been 
hidden for so many centuries from the 
knowledge of the nations of the earth, 
if the Lord had not revealed it. There 
is said to be a record among the 
Scandianvians that some of that race 
penetrated the western sea and land- 
ed on the coast of North America. 
This may or may not be so. The 
Welsh also claim that a prince of their 
blood also reached this land. The 



Irish also have a tradition that some 
of their race penetrated the western 
ocean and reached the land. But who- 
ever did this. If any, left nothing on 
record to incite the nations of the earth 
to the belief that there lay hidden, 
enveloped In the mists of the western 
sea, a large hemisphere such as the 
continent of North and South America. 
The knowledge of it was completely 
hidden, as completely as if it did not 
belong to our globe. Navigators sailed 
to and fro; but through the long cen- 
turies that elapsed from the confusion 
of tongues at the Tower of Babel, when 
the inhabitants of the earth were 
scattered, until the time that Colum- 
bus, inspired of God, went from court 
to court, pleading with the govern- 
ments of nations to give him the means 
to penetrate the ocean and find what 
he supposed was the Indies — during 
all that time the knowledge of this 
land was kept from all the nations of 
the earth. Is not this wonderful? 
How can we account for it? There is 
only one way, and that is the way the 
Lord accounts for it; He tells us 
through His servant that the knowl- 
edge of this land should be kept from 
all the nations of the earth, because if 
it were not they would overrun the 
land. It was a land too choice to be 
left unoccupied, possessed of too many 
of those elemnts that enrich indi- 
viduals and peoples. The nations of 
the earth would have swarmed here 
by the hundreds of thousands, and 
there would have been no place found 
upon the land for the great events that 
are taking place now and for the peo- 
ple who now possess the land. There 
would have been no room for the 
Church of Christ, no room for the 
kingdom of God, no room for the gath- 
ering of the millions that will yet 
come to Zion, to build up the kingdom 
of God on this land and to prepare the 
way for the establishment of the New 
Jerusalem; for this is the favored land 
upon which the New Jerusalem will 
be established. We, therefore, can see 
today how the Lord has prepared the 
way for the gathering of the people 
from all the nations of the earth, and 
how His providence has been over this 
choice land above all other lands. 
There is plenty of room here; not 
crowding upon anybody; not com- 
pelled to come as conquerors have in

other ages who have overrun other 
lands and driven out or destroyed the 
people who occupied the land. In order 
that they might possess it. No neces- 
sity for this; for God has made 
abundant provisions. He has kept in 
reserve this glorious land, in order 
that in the last days His kingdom 
could be established, and that under 
the inspiration which He should give, 
a government might be founded — a 
government of liberty, a government 
of freedom, giving to all the utmost 
liberty they could desire, and promis- 
ing to those who should possess the 
land many precious things; for He 
has told us that none should be 
brought here except they should come 
by His permission. Therefore, the 
emigration that has come from the be- 
ginning, and that is still coming, 
comes by the permission of the Al- 
mighty. He is watching over it, and 
He will control it and bring to pass 
His purposes in connection with it. 
He has told us that if we will only 
worship the God of this land, Jesus 
Christ, we cannot be brought into 
bondage or into captivity by any other 
nation. The powers of Europe may 
band together and indulge in hopes of 
conquering this nation; but the Lord 
has said— and it will be fulfilled if we 
do right— that they will be defeated 
in all their schemes, and this shall be 
a land of liberty unto the righteous. 
This nation of ours, so glorious in its 
past, so glorious in its prospects of 
the future, will stand and never be 
overthrown, unless the inhabitants of 
the land reject Jesus Christ, the King 
and the God of the land. Now we 
know the conditions upon which vic- 
tory will be assured to us as a nation. 
If this nation had listened to Joseph 
Smith, the Prophet of God; if they had 
been counseled by him, God would 
have adopted this nation and its gov- 
ernment, and made it His; for the 
promises are to that effect. Now, what 
the future will be depends upon the 
conduct of those who possess the land 
and upon the administration of affairs 
in the land. 

There is one thing that has glad- 
dened me very much during this re- 
cent agitation concerning war; I have 
been pleased exceedingly at the course 
that has been taken by the adminis- 
tration in this threatened difficulty. 



There has been so manifest a desire 
and determination on the part of 
President McKinley and those imme- 
diately connected with him, to keep 
down excitement, to prevent the cir- 
culation of falsehood and everything 
that would disturb the public mind 
and inflame it against Spain, that I 
have been very much pleased. 

In connection with this I would like 
to read a revelation which the Lord 
has given to us as a people, because 
I see in the conduct of the adminis- 
tration some features that agree with 
the instructions of the Lord. The 
Lord, in speaking about the plan that 
He recommended to His ancients, 
says: 

"Behold, this is the law I gave unto 
my servant Nephi, and thy fathers 
Joseph, and Jacob, and Isaac, and 
Abraham, and all mine ancient Proph- 
ets and Apostles. 

"And again, this is the law that I 
gave unto mine ancients, that they 
should not go out unto battle against 
any nation, kindred, tongue, or people, 
save I, the Lord, commanded them. 

Here is a law given that is of the ut- 
most importance to the inhabitants of 
the earth, as well as to us as a people. 
It is the law by which the inhabitants 
of the earth should be governed, and 
we, as Latter-day Saints especially, 
should understand this law and ba 
governed by it; and not, as we have 
been told at this Conference, indulge 
in warlike demonstrations or manifest 
a bloodthirsty disposition. We should 
be a peaceful people, seeking peace, 
and endeavoring to escape all the hor- 
rors of war, and to avert them from 
the nations of the earth, particularly 
our own nation. The Lord says: 

"And if any nation, tongue, or peo- 
ple, should proclaim war against 
them, they should first lift a standard 
of peace unto that people, nation, or 
tongue." 

I have been impressed (and I say this 
aside from any political bias, not wish- 
ing political feeling to enter into a 
question of this kind) with the conduct 
of the administration in relation to 
this. There has seemed to me to be a 
determination on the part of President 
McKinley and those immediately as- 
sociated with him to push off war and 
to do all in their power to avert it. 
Because of their apparent hesitation 



86 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



some have become Inflamed against 
them, and have felt that the dignity 
of the nation was not being main- 
tained, and that we were not doing 
as we should do to punish Spain for 
her supposed action In relation to the 
destruction of the battleship Maine, 
and because of her treatment of the 
Cubans. The feelings of our nation 
have been stirred up by reports in the 
newspapers, many of which have been 
incorrect and without foundation. 
While the examination concerning 
the destruction of the Maine was go- 
ing on, the administration has been 
under the continued necessity of pub- 
licly denying the false stories that 
had obtained circulation; and they did 
this in the interests of peace, to keep 
the people of our nation from being 
misled and stirred up to such a de- 
gree of indignation that they could 
not be controlled. I have admired this, 
and I have thanked God that this 
spirit has been given unto the men 
that have our nation and its affairs 
in charge, because I have recognized 
how much it agreed with what the 
Lord has said. Spain has not yet pro- 
claimed war against this nation; but 
if she has countenanced (which I do 
not believe she did) the destruction of 
the battleship Maine, or even if the 
ruling powers in Spain have done it, 
and were determined to have war with 
us, the Lord says we should lift up a 
standard of peace unto that nation. 
That is the duty of this nation. That 
is the duty of the Latter-day Saints, 
when their enemies come against them 
to make war upon them. We must 
proclaim peace; do all in our power 
to appease the wrath of our enemies; 
make any sacrifice that honorable peo- 
ple can to avert war, with all its hor- 
rors, entailing as it does dreadful con- 
sequences so numerous that they can- 
not be mentioned. It is our duty, I 
say, as a nation. The influence of the 
Latter-day Saints should be used in 
this direction. We should seek to 
quell these feelings of anxiety to fight 
and to shed blood. Our influence 
should go forth like oil poured upon 
the troubled waters, quieting the 
waves of discontent and wrath that 
are aroused by this fearful spirit. The 
Lord then tells us what should be 
done: 



"And if that people did not accept 
the offering of peace neither the sec- 
ond nor the third time," 

Not only ought we to extend the 
offering of peace the first time to a 
nation that proclaims war against us. 
but again the second time; and if that 
should be rejected, again the third 
time; and if it be rejected the third 
time, then 

"They should bring these testimonies 
before the Lord." 

Go to the Lord, and say, "Here are 
our testimonies. We have offered peace 
the first time; we have offered it 
twice; we have offered it three times; 
but our offerings are rejected, and this 
nation is determined to have war with 
us. Now we bring these testimonies 
before thee, Lord." 

"Then I, the Lord, would give unto 
them a commandment, and justify 
them in going out to battle against 
that nation, tongue, or people, 

"And I, the Lord, would fight their 
battles, and their children's battles, 
and their children's children's, until 
they had avenged themselves on all 
their enemies, to the third and fourth 
generation. 

"Behold, this is an ensample unto all 
people, saith the Lord your God, for 
justification before me. 

I do not look for our nation to do 
this. It is scarcely to be expected, in 
the nature of things, that they would 
do it. But it is the true principle, and 
we as a people should use our influ- 
ence for this purpose. Our prayers 
should ascend to God; our petitions 
should ascend to the government of 
our nation to do everything that hon- 
orable people can to avert war. We 
have no fear of the effect of the com- 
binations against us. Spain might in- 
flict great damage upon our coasts. 
Her naval strength is equal if not su- 
perior to ours. We have a very ex- 
tended line of seacoast, and a diffi- 
cult line to defend against a strong 
naval power. And we might suffer in 
the beginning. But the promise of God 
is that if we will do right as a nation, 
if we will serve Him, they shall not 
have power over us, or be able to 
bring us into bondage; and in the end 
we shall prevail. This is a glorious 
promise which is made to the inhab- 
itants of this land. I would to God 



PRESIDENT GEORGE Q. CANNON. 



87 



that the whole nation would believe 
it. I would to God that they would 
accept the testimonies of the past, the 
prophecies that have been referred to 
this afternoon; for I say to you, as I 
would like to say to this entire nation, 
i nere are prophets of God in the land. 
The word of God is in the midst of the 
people. The Lord reveals His mind 
and will unto His servants the Proph- 
ets. The Droofs of it are before all 
the nations of the earth. There is 
abundant evidence to substantiate the 
statements which have been made that 
the Lord has revealed His will, and 
that there are Prophets in the land. 
And if the nation would believe, the 
Lord would make them the great and 
mighty power that we are told by the 
ancient Prophets this nation might 
become. 

To us as Latter-day Saints these 
principles are of the utmost import- 
ance. I do not want to see our young 
men get filled with the spirit of war 
and be eager for the conflict. God for- 
bid that such a spirit should prevail 
in our land, or that we should con- 
tribute in any manner to the propaga- 
tion of a spirit of that kind! But one 
may say, "Is it not our duty to defend 
our country and our flag? Is it not 
our duty to maintain the institutions 
which the Lord has given to us?" 
Certainly it is. And it is no part of 
cowardice to take the plan that the 
Lord has pointed out. No man need be 
afraid that the Lord or any just man 
will look upon him as a coward. 

There was a time when men who be- 
came angry at each other fought 
duels. A man of honor considered it 
his duty, if he received an insult, to 
challenge the insulter, and the man 
that was challenged had the choice of 
weapons, and they fought in single 
combat to avenge their honor. And 
such a feeling prevailed on this ques- 
tion that brave men were liable to be 
charged with cowardice if they did not 
fight. It took the bravest kind of men 
to refuse to fight. But it is not an 
evidence of true courage to be willing 
to rush into a fight. Sometimes the 
bravest of people shrink from any such 
action as this; when the time comes to 
fight, however, they are the bravest, 
and the slowest to yield. 

The Lord has given us a command 
in connection with this subject that 



is worth while for us to bear in mind: 
"For he will give unto the faithful 
line upon line, precept upon precept; 
and I will try you and prove you here- 
with; 

"And whoso layeth down his life in 
my cause, for my name's sake, shall 
find it again, even life eternal: 

"Therefore be not afraid of your ene- 
mies, for I have decreed in my heart, 
saith the Lord, that I will prove you 
in all things, whether you will abide 
in my covenant, even unto death, that 
you may be found worthy." 

In this revelation the Lord requires 
us to be a brave people, a true and 
faithful people. As one of our hymns 
says: 

"We want no cowards in our band, 

Who will our colors fly; 
We call for valiant-hearted men, 

Who're not afraid to die." 

This is the kind of people that 
are wanted in the Church of Christ; 
not cowards, or men who will shirk 
and fly in the hour of danger. Such 
people are not wanted. At the same 
time the Lord expects us to be a 
peace-loving people, willing to do 
everything in our power for peace, to 
preserve the lives of the human family, 
to deliver every person, to the extent 
of our ability, from all the evils that 
Satan would bring upon them. There- 
fore, I hope if there is a disposition 
not to clamor for war that it will not 
be attributed to cowardice or to the 
fear of losing life. God has command- 
ed us to be ready to lay down our lives 
whenever it shall be necessary. If it 
should be to defend our religion, we 
have in days past shown our fearless- 
ness in that direction. Speaking gen- 
erally, our people have not been afraid 
to lay down their lives for their re- 
ligion. We should be equally willing, 
if it should be necessary, to lay down 
our lives for our country, for its in- 
stitutions, for the preservation of its 
liberty, that these glorious blessings 
and privileges shall be preserved to all 
mankind, and especially to those with 
whom we are immediately connected. 
A man is of very little value that 
would not be willing to take the 
chances in a contest where these im- 
portant interests were at stake; for 
these interests are of far more value 
than life itself. I believe that the day 
will come, or is here now, that if this 



88 



GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



people called Latter-day Saints should 
be required to go to defend their 
country and Its institutions, their 
homes and their religion, and the rights 
of their fellow-men, there would be an 
almost universal response In favor of 
that. Therefore, that which I say upon 
these points is not in favor of shrink- 
ing from the defense of everything 
that is right, or of doing anything that 
would be craven and unworthy of 
honorable people. I would not like to 
see our government put itself in a po- 
sition that it would not stand fair be- 
fore all the nations of the earth; and 
every effort that we make for peace 
will make us stand fair, because there 
is a feeling throughout the world 
that the American people are strong 
enough to be magnanimous, and that 
when they are magnanimous, it is not 
prompted by any craven or unworthy 
feeling. 

Brethren and sisters, I have en- 
deavored to lay before you some of the 
promises that God has made to us. 
I say "us," because we are inhabitants 
of this land and possessors in com- 
mon with our fellow citizens. I have 
read this to you so that if you need 
comfort it may be imparted unto you. 
There need be no trepidation in our 
hearts concerning the threatening as- 
pect of affairs. If war should come, 
it will no doubt come because of the 
determination of Spain to force it 
upon us. I feel confident that there 
is no disposition on the part of our 
own government, whatever may be 
the feeling of the masses of the people, 
to create war. The freedom of Cuba 
has nothing particularly to do with 
us, only this far: They are on our 
borders, and the atrocities which have 
been committed have been of so aw- 
ful a character that we would be less 
than human if we did not sympathize 
with them. Our government is amply 
justified in demanding that these 
atrocities shall cease. We would be 
less than human if we could sit quiet- 
ly by and see people massacred and 
starved to death as they have been 
and are being on the island of Cuba. 
It is not the newspaper correspondents 
alone who have brought these tidings 
to us; but men of the highest repute 
have told of the conditions there. I 
have myself had communications upon 
the subject from one of the leading 



men in this nation, who visited Cuba 
personally. Of course, we all have 
seen what the newspapers have said. 
Under these circumstances, men and 
women who have the least feeling for 
their fellow creatures must cry out 
against the continued perpetration of 
such horrors, and the word should go 
forth that they must cease. We cannot 
allow a continuation of these scenes 
while we have the power as a nation 
to put an end to them. Then if Spain 
is determined, because of this position 
that we have assumed, to make war 
upon us, let us do the best we can 
under the circumstances. But I hope 
that Spain will see the folly of continu- 
ing this, and will give those poor, 
wretched people the liberty they are 
contending for. 

I pray God the Eternal Father to be 
with us as a people, to fill us with 
sentiments of justice and mercy, with 
comprehensive views concerning our 
relationship to mankind in general, 
and the duties that devolve upon us 
because of our position. For I say to 
you this day that the Latter-day 
Saints, in some respects, occupy the 
most influential position of any people 
upon the face of the earth, according 
to our numbers. And our influence 
will be felt more and more, especially 
if we will only be united. It is our union 
that gives us power. Take that away 
from us and we are weak as water. 
But united, bound together in holiness, 
in purity, and in the love of liberty 
and of truth, we are the strongest 
people upon the face of the earth. 
God grant that this may continue, and 
increase, until all shall be fulfilled 
that has been spoken concerning Zion 
and this glorious land >f ours. I ask 
it in the name of Jesus. Amen. 

PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF 

Historical incidents — Keys of power from Joseph to 
the Twelve— Founders of our nation Inspired — 
Afflictions awaiting the world — Importance of re- 
deeming the dead. 

At the close of this Conference I 
have a desire to bear my testimony 
before you upon a few principles. I 
have rejoiced very much during this 
Conference in listening to the testi- 
mony of the Apostles and Elders who 
have spoken. It has brought to my 
remembrance a little of my history. 



PRESIDEN1 WILFORD WOODRUFF 



89 



In April, 1838, while in the town of 
Kirtland, in walking across the street 
I met two men who held the Apostle- 
ship. They said to me, "Brother 
Woodruff, we have something that we 
want you to join us in." Said I, "What 
is it?" "We want another Prophet to 
lead us." "Whom do you want?" 
"We want Oliver Cowdery. Joseph 
Smith has apostatized." After listen- 
ing to them, I said to them: "Unless 
you repent of your sins you will be 
damned and go to hell, and you will 
go through the fulness of eternal 
damnation, and all your hopes in this 
life will pass before you like the frosi 
before the rising sun. You are false. 
Joseph Smith has not apostatized. 
He holds the keys of the kingdom of 
God on earth, and will hold them until 
the coming of the Son of Man, whether 
in this world or in the world to come." 
I am happy to say that those men did 
repent pretty soon, turned to the 
Church, and died in it. 

I feel thankful today that Joseph F. 
Smith is with us as a son of Hyrum 
Smith. He bears a true and faithful 
testimony of his father. I would to 
God that Joseph Smith had a son in 
the flesh who would do as Joseph F. 
Smith does here — bear testimony to 
the truth of his father. The Prophet 
Joseph Smith has no son that stands 
in the midst of the Church of God and 
bears record of his father. He never 
has had; possibly never will have. 

I will give you a testimony here that 
will show you where I stand with re- 
gard to this matter. Joseph Smith 
never ordained his son Joseph, never 
blessed him, never set him apart, to 
lead this Church and kingdom on the 
face of the earth. When he or any 
other man says he did, they state that 
which is false before high heaven. 

The last speech that Joseph Smith 
ever made to the quorum of the Apos- 
tles was in a building in Nauvoo, and 
it was such a speech as I never heard 
from mortal man before or since. He 
was clothed upon with the Spirit and 
power of God. His face was clear 
as amber. The room was filled as 
with consuming fire. He stood three 
hours upon his feet. Said he: "You 
Apostles of the Lamb of God hare 
been chosen to carry out the purposes 
of the Lord on the earth. Now, I 
have received, as the Prophet, seer and 



revelator, standing at the head of this 
dispensation, every key, every or- 
dinance, every principle and every 
Priesthood that belongs to the last 
dispensation and fulness of times. And 
I have sealed all these things upon 
your heads. Now, you Apostles, if_ 
you do not rise up and bear off this 
kingdom, as I have given it to you, 
you will be damned." 

I am the only witness left on earth 
that can bear record of this, and I 
am thankful that I have lived to see 
the day in which I stand. I am thank- 
ful to see the sons of these Prophets 
and Apostles holding the Holy Priest- 
hood in our day and generation. I do 
not believe the day will ever come — 
it is too late in the day, in my opinion 
—when any Elder in this Church will 
be called to stand before any two of 
the Apostles with us today and give 
unto them the declaration that I gaAie 
unto the two Apostles I have referred 
to. I do not think any of the Apostles 
will occupy that position. I have faith 
to believe that these men who bear 
the Apostleship will hold it and live 
their religion. They have been called 
and ordained of God for this purpose. 
I do not think that one of them will 
apostatize. I believe they will be with 
you and with this Church while they 
stand in the flesh, true and faithful 
to God. 

Brother Cannon has been laying be- 
fore you something with regard to the 
nation in which we live and what has 
been said concerning it. I am going 
to bear my testimony to this assembly, 
if I never do it again in my life, that 
those men who laid the foundation of 
this American government and signed 
the Declaration of Independence were 
the best spirits the God of heaven 
could find on the face of the earth. 
They were choice spirits, not wicked 
men. General Washington and all the 
men that labored for the purpose were 
inspired of the Lord. 

Another thing I am going to say 
here, because I have a right to say it. 
Every one of those men that signed 
the Declaration of Independence, with 
General Washington, called upon me, 
as an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ, 
in the Temple at St. George, two con- 
secutive nights, and demanded at my 
hands that I should go forth and at- 
tend to the ordinances of the House of

GENERAL CONFERENCE. 



God for them. Men are here, I believe, 
that know of this, Brothers J. D. T. 
McAllister, David H. Cannon and 
James G. Bleak. Brother McAllister 
baptized me for all those men, and 
then I told those brethren that it was 
their duty to go Into the Temple and 
labor until they had got endowments 
for all of them. They did it. Would 
those spirits have called upon me, as 
an Elder in Israel, to perform that 
work if they had not been noble 
spirits before God? They would not. 

I bear this testimony, because it is 
true. The Spirit of God bore record 
to myself and the brethren while we 
were laboring in that way. 

What has been said with regard to 
this nation and to our position is com- 
ing to pass. All the powers of earth 
and hell will not stay the hand of 
Almighty God in the fulfillment of 
those great prophecies that have 
to come to pass to prepare the way 
for the coming of the Son of Man. 
You who have gathered here are my 
witnesses of this. I feel as though the 
day has come when every Elder and 
every Latter-day Saint ought to stop 
and consider the position he is in and 
the covenants he has entered into. Is 
there anything on the face of the earth 
that will pay you to depart from the 
oracles of God and from the Gospel of 
Christ? Is there anything that will 
pay you to lose the principles of sal- 
vation, to lose a part in the first resur- 
rection with the privilege of standing 
in the morning of the resurrection 
clothed with glory, immortality 
and eternal life at the head of 
your father's house? No, there is 
nothing. I feel sorry many times when 
I see men who have the Priesthood 
forget almost that they have any in- 
terest in the work of God. 

I feel to thank God that I have lived 
as long as I have, and to see as much 
as I have in fulfillment of the words 
of the Prophet of God. His days were 
few. The lives of great men have been 
strange. The idea of Jesus Christ, the 
Son of the living God, only laboring 
three years and a half in the ministry 
and then He was put to death! His 
apostles, too, were put to death, ex- 
cepting John the Revelator, and they 
would have killed him if they could 
have done so. He lived because God 
wanted him to live. We live in the 



last dispensation and in the midst of 
the great work that all the Patriarchs 
and Prophets since God made the 
world have spoken of. Afflictions and 
tribulations await the world. The 
destroying angels have got their sharp 
sickles in their hands, and they are 
going to reap the earth. Everything 
that has been spoken by the prophets 
under the inspiration of the Holy 
Ghost will come to pass in the genera- 
tion in which we live. Do not forget 
it. I thank God we are as well as we 
are; that we have as many as we have 
who are united together in the Priest- 
hood. Let us try to live our religion, 
do our duty, and magnify our calling 
while we are here. The eyes of all 
heaven are over us. The eyes of the 
world are over us. The eyes of the 
angels are over us. The Lord has 
looked upon us and upon the house of 
Israel to be saviors of the nations. 
We are here to fulfill these principles. 

I pray God my Heavenly Father 
that as Elders of Israel and as Lat- 
ter-day Saints we may prize these 
principles, and that we may do oui 
duty what time we spend here in the 
flesh. These Apostles and all the 
quorums of the Priesthood have a 
great work upon them. Every father, 
and mother has a great responsibility 
resting upon them, to redeem their 
dead. Do not neglect it. You will 
have sorrow if you do. Any man will 
who neglects the redemption of his 
dead that he has power to officiate for 
here. When you get to the other side 
of the veil, if you have entered into 
these Temples and redeemed you pro- 
genitors by the ordinances of the 
House of God, you will hold the keys 
of their redemption from eternity to 
eternity. Do not neglect this! God 
bless you. Amen. 

The anthem, 
God of Israel, hear our prayer, 
was sung by the choir. 

Benediction by Elder C. W. Penrose.

DESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION. 



Its Annual General Conference. 



Minutes of Annual Sunday School 
Conference held in the Tabernacle, Salt 
Lake City, Sunday evening, April 10, 
189c', at 7 p. m. 

The General Superintendency, Mem- 
bers and Aids of the Union Board, 
President Joseph F. Smith, several 
Apostles, a large number of Stake and 
Ward Officers and Sunday School 
workers were present. 

The choir, under the direction of 
Prof. Evan Stephens, sang: 

Great God attend while Zion sings. 

Prayer was offerel by LM"r Andrew 
Kimball. 

The choir sang: Lord, Thou wilt 
hear me when I pray. Elder 
Seymour B. Young called the 
roll, which was responded to by 
twenty-nine out of the thirty-seven 
Stakes. He also presented the Gen- 
eral Sunday School Authorities, who 
were unanimously sustained as fol- 
lows: 

George Q. Cannon, general superin- 
tendent; George Goddard first assistant 
general superintendent; Karl G. Mae- 
ser, second assistant general superin- 
tendent; George Reynolds, general 
treasurer.

School Union Board: George Q. Can- 
non, George Goddard, Karl G. Maeser, 
George Reynolds, Thomas C. Griggs, 
Joseph W. Summerhays, Levi W. 
Richards, Francis M. Lyman, Heber 
J. Grant, Joseph M. Tanner, George 
Teasdale, Hugh J. Cannon and An-

tall, James W. Ure, John F. Bennett,

FIRST ASSISTANT GENERAL SU- 
PERINTENDENT GEORGE 
GODDARD 

requested all Sunday school teachers 
and Sunday school children present to 
rise to their feet. In response to 
this request almost the entire vast 
congregation arose. 

FIRST ASSISTANT SUPERINTEND- 
ENT GEORGE GODDARD 
then said. It is very pleasing to see 
so many that are interested in the 
youth of Zion. You may have noticed 
that when Brother Seymour B. Young 
called the names of the thirty-seven 
Stakes of Zion, representatives of all 
responded with the exception of eight. 

During the last year annual Sunday 
school conferences have been held in 
every one of those Stakes, and at each 
of these conferences one or more of 
the members of the general board 
have had the privilege of being pres- 
ent. 

It is very gratifying, and I, for one, 
felt extremely grateful to our Heavenly 
Father while listening to the statistics 
that were read the other day. Dur- 
ing the last year we have had an in- 
crease of 165 Sunday schools, and of 
between five and six thousand Sunday 
school children. These are very en- 
couraging facts. 

In these annual conferences there is 
one subject that we seldom forget to 
speak about, it is to train our chil- 
dren in concert singing in the Sunday 
schools; to teach them to sing and 
take part in the praises of our Heaven- 
ly Father. And, in connection with 
that subject, I have been led to recom- 
mend that the fathers and the mothers 
bring their hymn books with them 
when they come to our religious as- 
semblies. Who is expected to take

part In the Blnglng? All the Latter- 
duy Saints have the privilege of Join- 
ing In the song. It Is good to have 
choirs to keep up the tone of the song 
and to lead; but to enjoy the singing, 
If you cannot sing without making 
discord, you must follow and take note 
of what Is being sung and enjoy the 
principle or the doctrine that is con- 
tained In that song In our prayers 
one person speaks, all the rest close 
their eyes and open their ears and 
when the prayer is ended for a re- 
sponse, they say amen. 

Our Sunday school institution is a 
very elaborate one. The grand object 
and chief aim of our Sunday school 
efforts are to train up our children to 
become Latter-day Saints; that when 
they grow up they may show by their 
daily example that they have been 
taught the principles of the Gospel, 
and that they have been trained to 
true religious habits. 

There are two grand principles that 
have been especially spoken upon 
during this conference. Since 1852 it 
has been my privilege to attend 
eighty-five conferences in this city, 
and I feel that the one that has just 
terminated has been better than any 
conference hitherto held. And I am 
going to prophesy about this confer- 
ence. There will be more tithe payers, 
resulting from the instructions given 
at this conference, than there has ever 
been from any previous conference. 
More will go away from this confer- 
ence and observe the Word of Wisdom 
than have ever left any previous con- 
ference. The Saints are improving. 
The object of our conferences is to 
make better Saints than we have 
been, and to remind us of the duties 
that we must henceforth more rigidly 
observe. 

Many subjects have yet to be treated 
upon in relation to our Sunday schools. 
But I feel grateful to acknowledge the 
hand of my Heavenly Father that has 
been over us in this direction. God 
bless the superintendents, the teachers 
and the children connected with our 
schools. 

We are waiting, anxiously waiting, 
for the superintendent of some Stake 
of Zion to send word to headquarters 
that not only the superintendents but 
all the teachers and children, that ar.e 
old enough to learn anything, are 



strict observers of the law of tithing 
and of the Word of Wisdom. Superin- 
tendents, will you kindly labor to this 
end .that we may show forth the 
fruits of our labors, scattered through 
the Stakes of Zion. And that this may 
be the case, is my prayer, in the 
name of Jesus. Amen. 

ELDER LARS E. EGGERTSEN, 

superintendent of Utah Stake, said: 

My brethren and sisters, I have the 
pleasure this evening of representing 
the Stake superintendencies of Zion. 
My remarks will be specially addressed 
to First Assistant Superintendent 
George Goddard. 

Brother George Goddard, this occa- 
casion, with permission, has been se- 
lected by the Stake superintendencies 
of the Sunday schools of Zion as a 
fitting occasion to express to you our 
esteem for the untiring efforts with 
which you have labored in the Sunday 
school cause, for holding up before us, 
both in precept and example, that en- 
sign of the millennium — the Word of 
Wisdom; for showing to us what a 
complete and consecrated devotion to 
a noble cause means. Accept, there- 
fore, our appreciation of your wise 
counsel; our love by reason of your 
solcitude in our behalf; our determi- 
nation to be true to the principles 
that have caused you to be so devoted- 
ly interested in bringing God's chil- 
dren near to Him. We say with the 
poet: 

"Master, go on, and I will follow Thee 
To the last gasp, with truth and 
loyalty." 

We thank God for one whose life has 
exemplified Christ's teaching, "Let 
your light so shine before men that 
they may see your good works and 
glorify your Father which is in 
heaven." Accept the veneration 
which we would offer to one who has 
had an unfaltering faith in God's 
laws; the reverence we feel for one 
whose life has been unselfish. 

"He who strives the world to lift and 

save 

By deeds of sweet self-sacrifice 
And noble Christian love, 
Will find e'en though he seek an early 
grave, 

His image, pure as morning skies 
Reflected there above." 

Among the number who do you honor, 
some are crowned with hairs of silver

and are named among the first in the 
great Sunday school cause of the Lat- 
ter-day Saints. There are those, who, 
for many years, have borne the heat 
of much anxiety. And there are those 
who first knew you, when as little 
children, they heard your voice in 
melody sing, "Who's on the Lord's side, 
who?" 

Tonight, Brother Goddard.we united- 
ly ask you to accept a token, and to 
permit us, by the hand of one of Zion's 
fair daughters, to place upon your 
breast this medal, inscribed as follows: 
"To George Goddard, April 10th, 1898. 
Who'se on the Lord's side, who? From 
Zion's Sunday School Stake Superin- 
tendencies, representing 37 Stakes, 630 
Schools, 10,429 officers and teachers 
and 88,497 pupils." And at the same 
time we assure you by this token that 
we shall ever strive to follow your 
precepts and emulate your worthy ex- 
ample. We also ask you to accept 
this purse, the contents of which you 
are to use in the manner that will give 
you the most joy. 

Sister Alice McLachlan then pinned 
the gold clasp and medal on Brother 
Goddard's bosom, and the purse con- 
taining $100 was handed him. 

The Tabernacle choir and congrega- 
tion sang "Who'se on the Lord's side, 
who ?." 

To Elder George Goddard, First As- 
sistant General Superintendent 
Latter-day Saints' Sunday Schools, 
Salt Lake City, Utah: 

Dear Brother: — In connection with 
the medal and purse presented to you 
by the various Stake superintendencies 
of the Sunday schools of Zion, it may 
not be improper to give you a brief out- 
line of the movement from its incep- 
tion, and it is with that object in view 
that this sketch is written. 

Let us say by way of introduction 
that this movement has been in mind 
for two years, but the method of pro- 
cedure was not definitely settled until 
the beginnig of the present year. Since 
the idea first presented itself, several 
of the Stake Sunday school superin- 
tendents were consulted, and each one 
expressed himself in favorable terms, 
and pledged co-operation in whatever 
might be undertaken. 

At a meeting of the Utah Stake 
superintendency in January, 1898 , a 



formal motion was carried, that a 
letter be written to each Stake super- 
intendent, explaining the matter, and 
asking for $1, and for suggestions as 
to what would be suitable for a pres- 
ent, and best express to you the feel- 
lings of the Sunday school workers. 

To this letter came a hearty response 
from nearly all of the Stakes, some 
giving one suggestion, some another; 
a number felt that the amount pro- 
posed was entirely inadequate. Those 
who did not make any suggestion left 
the matter with the Utah Stake officers 
to select whatever they thought proper. 
Among the letters most ardently ad- 
vocating that more should be done 
than was at first intended, was that 
of the superintendency of the Salt 
Lake Stake, these brethren being 
really the fathers of the idea which 
has now taken bodily shape — that the 
present to you be a medal and a purse. 
It was acted upon, a report was made 
to the various Stake officers, and 
again encouragement in the labor of 
love was given. Almost every letter 
has had words something like the fol- 
lowing: 

"I heartily concur in the idea of 
making a present to Superintendent 
George Goddard, who has labored so 
long and so faithfully in behalf of 
the Sunday schools of Zion, and think 
that too much cannot be done for him. 
Enclosed you will find a postoffice or- 
der and if you need more, let us 
know." 

Not only did the Stake officers re- 
spond to the suggestion, but private 
parties who heard of the affair inci- 
dentally, desired and asked for the 
privilege of contributing for the pur- 
pose of showing the esteem in which 
you are held by all of the Latter-day 
Saints. 

Arrangements were made with your 
co-laborers in the general superin- 
tendency, Brothers George Q. Cannon 
and Karl G. Maeser, to have the pre- 
sentation made at the regular Deseret 
Sunday school conference on the even- 
ing of April 10, 1898, and a short pro- 
gram was arranged with their consent 
and approval. 

The letters relating to the affair have 
been carefully filed and will be pre- 
served for future reference; they form 
a portion of the history of what was, 
up to the present time, perhaps, the

largest surprise party in the history 
of the world. 

And now, dear brother, in behalf of 
all the Sunday schools of Zlon, per- 
mit us to congratulate you upon the 
work you have done, a general sum- 
mary of whkh you have compiled as 
follows: 

"Fourteen months' mission to Cana-

"During the past forty-four years, I

Tabernacle, quorum, and fast meet- 
ings. 

"I have had the pleasure of being 
present at over eighty of our general 
conferences in Salt Lake City, and at- 
tending nearly every meeting at each 
conference. 

"I am now between 81 and 82 years 
old, and during the past three years, 
have traveled between twenty and 
thirty thousand miles in the interest 
and for the benefit of the youth of 
Zion who are connected with our Sun- 
day schools. 



"I use neither tea, coffee, tobacco, 
wine, beer, or liquor, and I am blest 
of the Lord with good health, which 
causes my heart to rejoice exceed- 
ingly." 

We ask God to spare your life until 
you are entirely satisfied. We know 
that so long as any one of the thou- 
sands of children shall be alive, who 
have heard your voice in songs of 
prayer and praise, and in exhortation, 
you will not be forgotten; and after 
all the present generation shall pass 
away, your labors will be read of by 
the Saints, and encouragement will be 
occasioned in the hearts of the faith- 
ful, who cannot but know of some of 
the difficulties which you have over- 
come by your persistent and untiring 
efforts to advance the interests of the 
Kingdom of God on the earth. 

Your brethren in the Sunday school 
cause, and in behalf of the Stake 
superntendencies,

Reap from our o'er laden hearts 
A mite of what thous't scattered there — 
In "Seeds of Kindness:" let thy song 
Prove its own worth: its truth de- 
clare. 

Our good absorbs the very life: 
Thine every thought our constant 

weal: 

What pleasure, in return, for us, 
To feebly show the love we feel. 
No, not in vain thine earnest word — 
Thy noble voice in song and prayer: 
The youth throughout the land have 
heard 

And pondered o'er their sense most 
rare. 

And many a valiant hero brave 
Stands "On the Lord's Side" firm 

today; 

Who but for thee might still have 

been 

But loitering, heedless, on the way. 
Give us the joy with thee to feel 
That love to love may here express 
Its very self in gratitude; 
For loving deeds and power to bless. 
p ow blest thou. art in ripened age; 
How blest to work while life shall last; 
In deeds of good still be thou blest 
Forever more, as in the past.

GENERAL, SUPERINTENDENT 
GEORGE Q. CANNON 

said. To me this is an unusu- 
ally interesting occasion; and I 
am sure every heart present re- 
joices exceedingly in this oppor- 
tunity of expressing the feelings 
that we all have towards Elder George 
Goddard. There has nothing been 
said here that he has not deserved. 
There is no eulogy that has been pro- 
nounced that is unmerited. Brother 
George Goddard has been especially 
endowed in this direction. His labors 
have been indefatigable. And none 
who have known his course can feel 
otherwise than that this testimonial is 
well deserved. I thought, while Brother 
Eggertson was describing the feelings 
which prompted and speaking of the 
testimonial, that there is another oc- 
casion — I hope that it is some distance 
off, that is if it involves the life of our 
beloved brother — an occasion when he 
will be crowned in the presence of God 
and the Lamb. That time will come 
and we shall witness it; because 
George Goddard, as I fully believe, will 
be faithful to the end, and will earn 
a crown of glory in the presence of God 
and the Lamb. That he may be 
blessed during the remainder of his 
life, that he may have physical vigor — 
you all know that his voice has been 
prserved; I trust it will be while he 
shall live — physical vigor to go, as he 
delights in going, to visit the various 
conferences of the Church in the vari- 
ous Stakes of Zion, until the Lord shall 
be fully satisfied with his labors, and 
he himself feel that he has completed 
the work assigned to him below, 
which is my prayer in his behalf, in 
the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 

ELDER FRANCIS M. LYMAN. 

I dislike to change the course of 
pleasure and joy that we have tasted 
because of this movement in favor of 
Elder Goddard. I have been on his 
track for a great many years and I 
have never found a person disposed to 
speak otherwise than to this great cred- 
it and honor. He lives in the hearts of 
all the Saints, the children and their 
parents and everybody. And I wonder 
why we shall not emulate the great 
example that he has set before us. 1 
trust we may, and that when we have 



come to the weight of years that he is 
under tonight, that good things can be 
said of us, and that we too may live 
in the hearts of the people because of 
our many years of faithful labor. 

I desire to speak a few words to you 
in regard to the subject of presiding 
in the Sunday schools, that is by the 
superintendents. We have noticed oc- 
casionally that the superintendent of 
a Sunday school is inclined to be so 
generous that he divides up the honor 
of presiding with his assistants, when 
he is present himself. And I wonder 
sometimes if the brethren have not 
taken from what they have seen, or 
what appears before us, in presiding in 
the general conferences and other 
places, that the duty of a president or 
a superintendent is intended to be 
shared and divided, so that one may 
be president on one ocasion and his as- 
sistant or counselor upon another. 1 
believe that the proper way is for the 
superintendent to preside, when he is 
present, and to direct all the affairs of 
the Sunday schools as a superintendent 
or president should do. So that visit- 
ing a Sunday school you may know 
who the superintendent is, or know 
who the presiding person is in that 
school. It is the duty of a president or 
superintendent to preside when present; 
when he is absent it is the business 
of his first assistant or counselor; and 
in the absence of the superintendent 
and the first assistant it is the duty of 
the second assistant. But the man 
whose duty it is to preside cannot lay 
off that responsibility; it is his 
business to exercise it; not that he 
should do all that is to be done, but 
what is done should be under his presi- 
dency and direction, when present. We 
notice here in our general conference 
that President Cannon and President 
Smith are called upon to present tht 
business before the conference, just as 
President S. B. Toung here acting as 
the clerk, calls the roll and presents the 
authorities of the Sunday school. 
Brother Goddard, as the first assistant 
superintendent, here, does his talking 
and often the work as general superin- 
tendent. But in the presence of Gen- 
eral Superintendent George Q. Cannon, 
who is the head and who is the chief, 
everything is conducted here just as he 
directs. I have noticed that Bishops as 
well in their council and ward meeting* 



96 



DESE RET SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION. 



and presidents of Stakes also, some- 
times surrender their meetings to the 
counselors Instead of the chief or pres- 
ident attending to the business of pre- 
siding. My view of this Is, In order to 
avoid confusion, that the chief or presi- 
dent who is called to preside is en- 
titled to the presiding Inspiration ot 
the occasion, and that the presiding in- 
spiration rests upon his first assistant 
in the absence of the superintendent 
or president. But otherwise conducted 
we find it produces confusion. I want- 
ed to make this suggestion. I have one 
more word to say and then I will finish. 
The time is precious. 

I have noticed in my travels through- 
out the Church that the Sunday schools 
and the parents of the Sunday school 
children are not patronizing the organ 
of the Sunday schools as it ought to 
be patronized. They are not failing 
on every occasion, for there are many 
wards where the Juvenile Instructor is 
well sustained, but we find very many 
wards where it is not sustained as it 
ought to be. It should be in every fam- 
ily; it should be in the homes of the 
people. It is worthy of the patronage 
of the Latter-day Saints, and we want 
to see it patronized and encouraged by 
the Church. It is suited to the parents, 
it is suited to the children and all ages; 
it is an authority, it speaks with the 
voice of authority unto the Latter-day 
Saints, and ought to be thoroughly well 
patronized by all the people. 

God bless you my brethren and sis- 
ters. Workers in the Sunday schools, 
do not weary, but live to win the same 
kind of crown which President Cannon 
says shall be placed upon the brow of 
Elder Goddard and if you desire such 
a name, win it for yourself by follow- 
ing the footsteps of that great man in 
the Sunday school cause. Amen. 

SECOND ASSISTANT KARL G. 
MAESER 

said. It will be scarcely necessary on my 
part to say with how much of my 
whole heart I rejoice in what we have 
witnessed in honor of our fellow-labor- 
er, Brother Goddard. And I add my 
prayer and blessing to what has been 
said and done in his behalf on the pres- 
ent occasion. 

The subject that has been assigned 
me to speak on for a few minutes Is 



the way and manner in which annual 
Sunday School Stake conferences 
should be conducted. According to the 
view of the Sunday School Union 
Board, all the exercises of our annual 
Stake conferences should be patterns 
and models for everything that is done 
in the Sunday schools; so that when 
the superintendents, teachers, officers 
and pupils of the various Sunday 
schools of the Stake return 
home they can say, "That is 
the way it was done at con- 
ference, and that is the way it should 
be done in our Sunday school." This 
means in regard to the discipline, seat- 
ing, good order and also in the carry- 
ing out of the program. The singing 
also should be a pattern. There 3hould 
be two or three choirs, the best that can 
be found in the Stake, to perform the 
singing, so that the Sunday schools of 
the Stake may have something on that 
point as a pattern and model to fol- 
low after. The marching to the various 
classes, the recitation of the classes 
that have exercises, should be done in 
such a beautiful, well trained way, that 
all the other Sunday schools can take 
pattern and follow them. 

There has been, to the sorrow and re- 
gret of the members of the Sunday 
School Union Board, here and there 
among the conferences, a failure in re- 
gard to these matters. Programs have 
been made but they were not carried 
out. I remember in two or three in- 
stances during my last visit in the 
South, that a thorough program, very 
neatly laid out, was presented to me, 
but when it came to its execution 
there was nobody to respond. The su- 
perintendent was full of excuses. This 
is not a pattern or model. There Is 
sufficient time given to all the super- 
intendents to have the necessary ar- 
rangements made previous to the Sun- 
day school conferences; so that when 
the teachers, superintendents and rep- 
resentatives of the various Sunday 
schools gather together they may see 
something that serves them as a guide 
in their labors. Every Sunday school 
conference should be a stepping stone 
and an improvement upon the one that 
has been held the year before; so that 
when the members of the Sunday 
School Union Board come around they 
can notice the progress, not only by the 
reports that are made by the superin- 



DESEkEl SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION. 



97 



tendents, but also by the various exer- 
cises that constitute the program of the 
conference during the Saturday's and 
Sunday's exercises. The Sunday School 
Union Board desire that the superin- 
tendents and officers of the Sunday 
schools will act on this matter, that 
from now on we shall notice in our vari- 
ous visits a marked improvement in 
this direction. 

ELDER SEYMOUR B. YOUNG. 

I am reminded of a circumstance 
that I wish to relate. A large court 
room was filled with judge, jury and 
spectators. An interesting trial was on, 
a woman being accused of un-Chris- 
tian-like conduct by a drunken hus- 
band. In the accusation it was said that 
she was not a proper person to rear her 
children. When the accusation was 
read by the clerk, the judge turned to 
the accused and said to her, "Madam, 
what have you to say to the charges?" 
She said in reply, "May it please your 
honor, I have taught my children to 
the best of my ability to be honest, 
God-fearing and sober, good children." 
There was one of her little girls, four 
years of age, sitting upon one of the 
high stools in the court room at the 
mother's side. The judge said, "Madam, 
I will prove you " and so said to the 
little girl, "What is your name?" She 
said, "My name is Mary." "Mary," 
said the judge, "Can you pray?" With- 
out any answer, the little child climbed 
from the high stool, knelt down upon 
the floor of the dirty court room and 
lifted her little eyes to heaven and 
clasping her hands repeated, without 
one stop or break, the i-iord's prayer. 
When she had closed the prayer and 
said amen, every heart in that room 
was melted and every eye filled with 
tears. "Gentlemen of the jury," said 
the judge, "I instruct you to give your 
verdict in favor of this woman, for a 
mother who can so teach her children 
in the way of true Christianity is in- 
deed a proper person to rear those 
children, and they should be left in her 
charge." 

I relate this, my brethren and sis- 
ters, to impress upon your minds the 
wonderful power for good that can 
be made and impressed forever upon 
the hearts of our little children in 
these wonderful Sunday schools of the 
Latter-day Saints, where they are be- 



ing taught and made acquainted with 
these noble principles, not only of the 
Lord's prayer, but of living its pre- 
cepts and the wonderful example that 
is contained within its tones and utter- 
ances. 

In relation to our friend, Brother 
George Goddard, I will quote: "If I 
should die tonight you would drop a 
tear on my pale, cold brow and say 
good things about me. O, do not wait 
till I am dead, let me hear those good 
things now, and let me feel, while the 
heart's warm blood is coursing through 
my veins, that I have gained love and 
esteem from those I love best." I am 
glad that we did not wait until Brother 
Goddard was dead before we showed 
him our love and something of our ap- 
preciation for his noble life work. 

ELDER GEORGE REYNOLDS" 

said. As treasurer of the Sunday 
School Union Board I wish to report 
that I have received from the various 
Stakes on Nickel Fund account for 
1897, $2,860. 

This is in excess of the collections 
of previous years. But I will say that 
during the same period the Union haa 
distributed in literature — charts, leaf- 
lets, and books, to the different Stakes 
and to the various missions of the 
Church more than this amount by sev- 
eral hundred dollars. And I would 
ask if the Stake treasurers have any 
means on hand that they will kindly 
send it to me as soon as possible so 
that I may close this account on my 
books. 

I will now read the suggested dates — 
Saturdays and Sundays — on which the 
forthcoming annual Stake Sunday, 
school cnferences will be held: 

April 30th and May 1st, Sanpete 
(Manti); May 7th and 8th, St. 
George; 14th and 15th, Parowan; 21st 
and 22nd, Millard; 28th and 29th, Juab; 
June 11th and 12th, Utah; 18th and 19th, 
Wasatch; 25th and 26th, Malad; July 
2nd and 3rd, Wayne; 9th and 10th, 
Sevier — Bear Lake; 16th and 17th, 
Morgan— Star Valley; 23rd and 24th, 
Bingham; 30th and 31st, Bannock; 
August 6th and 7th, Alberta; 13th and 
14th, Boxelder— Cassia; 20th and 21st, 
Cache — San Juan; 27th and 28th, 
Tooele; September 10th and 11th, Sum- 
mit— Beaver(Adamsville) ; 17th and 18th;.

Should a Stake superintendency wish 
to change its dates, they may submit 
their wishes to the General Board and 
if possible they will be complied with. 

We have Just received from the 
publisheres No. 4 of our Bible Charts. 
It is a very admirable collection, 
treating on incidents connected with 
the life of our Savior and His Apos- 
tles. These charts are now on sale 
at the office of the Sunday School 
Union in the Templeton building. 

I wish now to draw the attention of 
those superintendents and teachers 
who use the leaflets that this month 
a change is made from the Bible to the 
Book of Mormon. For many months past 
our leaflets have been devoted to Bible 
subjects, and having considered the 
ten commandments it was thought a 
good place to turn from the Bible for 
a time and resume Book of Mormon 
history, which has been taken up at 
the point wliere the last leaflet on that 
subject closed. Studies from the Book 
of Mormon will probably be continued 
•during the whole of the present year. 

On the back of miniature card No. 
12, accompanying No. 2 Book of Mor- 
mon Chart is what appears to be an 
error in the lesson statement and in the 
questions and answers. The picture 
on the card represents the baptism of 
King Limhi by the Prophet Alma. In 
this lesson it Is stated that Alma and 
his people reached the land of Zara- 
hemla from the land of Lehi-Nephi be- 
fore Limhi and his people did. Though 
no exact statement is made in the Book 
of Mormon in regard to this, yet the 
presumption, from the historical nar- 
rative, is very strong that Limhi and 
his people reached there before Alma 
and his people. Therefore those who are 
•teaching from this chart, when they 
reach this point, will please draw at- 
tention to this apparent error. 

A quartette was sung by Brother 
Thomas Ashworth and assocates. 

iGENERAL SUPERINTENDENT 
GEORGE Q. CANNON 
said. I will tell you heaven is not far 
off; it seems as though it had come 
down here close to us. That is the feeling 
as though there were heavenly beings 
here, and a very sweet spirit. I am 
cure you all feel it. 



I wish, before making any further 
remarks, to propose that President 
Joseph F. Smith be a member of the 
Deseret Sunday School Union Board. 
The business of choosing members of 
this board I have done but little about; 
but it struck me this evening that 
President Smith's name should be 
among the members of this board. All 
who are in favor of this will manifest 
it by raising the right hand. (Vote 
unanimous). I am sure he will accept 
of it 

I see I am put down for some re- 
marks. I want to speak in the first 
place upon the "Nickel fund." For 
many years I was opposed, very stren- 
uously opposed, to take up subscrip- 
tions from the Sunday schools. I felt 
we should manage our affairs without 
imposing the least burden upon the 
children or parents; that there should 
be nothing in the shape of assessments, 
if you call it such, collected from the 
Sunday schools. As the general super- 
intendent, I, for one, did not want any- 
thing of this kind that would be the 
least unpleasant, and for a great many 
years this has been carried out. My 
views upon this point prevailed; 
though there were many times 
it seemed as though some- 
thing of this kind should 
be done, because of the necessities of 
the Union. But we were able to get 
along and keep out of debt. We 
managed our affairs so that there was 
no debt, and we have since managed 
them so that there is no debt. But 
it was thought necessary, eventually, 
to establish what is called the "Nickel 
fund," a contribution of five cents from 
each child, once a year; and as we have 
been told tonight by our treasurer, 
that more than the value of these 
contributions have been returned to 
the schools, the purpose being not to 
burden the people, not to burden the 
children, not to burden their parents, 
and not to have anything of this kind 
associated with the Sunday school 
movement. But I have learned of late 
that there is a disposition in some of 
the Stakes to take up local subscrip- 
tions for the "Nickel fund," that is for 
purposes connected with the local 
organizations. 

Now, I wish to express myself on 
this point before this conference or 
gathering of Sunday school workers. 



DESERET SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION.

I want to say that I am not in favor 
of anything of this kind. Let us not 
permit ourselves to be drawn into 
measures of this kind. Let us conduct 
this movement without resorting to 
taxation of this character, and bring- 
ing ourselves into disrepute. I feel 
that this is very important, and feel 
impressed upon this, for I heard lately 
of several collections of this kind being 
taken up in the various Stakes or 
wards. Let us get along with good 
management without doing this. Do 
not burden the people, and do not bring 
our annual nickel fund into disrepute. 
I trust that our superintendents and 
those in charge of our Sunday schools 
will avoid everything of this kind. Do 
it in some other way. It can be done 
with good management. Do not make 
our Sunday schools collecting agencies. 
"We have now for twenty-six years had 
this organization and it has not been 
burdensome, it has not been oppressive, 
or become odious through taxation, 
and let us avoid it. 

Another point that I have felt very 
much impressed upon of late, it is in 
relation to the character of our litera- 
ture. There is a disposition to intro- 
duce different kinds of studies in the 
Sunday schools. I have written some 
on this point in the Juvenile Instruc- 
tor. There are 168 hours in our week. 
Out of those 16S hours we devote one 
hour and a half to the instruction of 
our children. We have about one 
hour and a half out of the 168. Now 
shall we introduce other studies in 
the schools to occupy the attention 
and engage the minds of our children? 
I think it wrong; and I wish to say 
this to those assembled, it is wrong. 
Let us devote the one and a half hours 
that the school occupies to the study 
of the word of God, where the children 
are old enough to read and understand 
it. And our theological classes, in- 
stead of having different works in the 
classes, let us confine the study to the 
Scriptures— the word of God. The ob- 
ject of our Sunday schools is to make 
Latter-day Saints of our children, 
that was the object in view when the 
Sunday schools were organized. Let 
us use this time for this purpose and 
for no other. If our children, young 
men or others, wish to study other 
works, let them take the time outside 
of the Sunday schools. They hav<= 



plenty of time. One hundred and sixty- 
six and a half hours are left to them 
to sleep and perform their various 
labors and to study. That gives them 
ample opportunity to acquire a knowl- 
edge of that which they may desire 
to obtain in connection with their 
Sunday school studies. I think you 
will all see the propriety of this. 
Let us give our children a thorough 
knowledge of our Scriptures, of the 
word of God, the Bible, that is, the 
Old and New Testaments, the Book of 
Mormon, the Pearl of Great Price; 
the Book of Doctrine and Covenants, is 
too advanced for our young children, 
but the older ones can read it. I de- 
sire to impress upon you the necessity 
of making our children thoroughly 
familiar wth the contents and teach- 
ings of these books. I know 
the children would be more benefited 
by them, by reading and paying at- 
tention to them, than anything that 
we can do or say for them in the shape 
of lessons or giving them other sub- 
jects or books to read. I trust that 
all will see the propriety of this. 

I have been led in visiting the con- 
ferences and in talking to the Sunday 
school children, to dwell upon the im- 
portance of the Word of Wisdom. I 
have also written upon the same sub- 
ject. I know it is thought by some to 
be a thread-bare subject; but I have 
felt impressed to talk to the children 
and to cease talking to the parents in 
the Church upon that subject. The* 
have had instruction enough. I have 
felt to leave this with themselves. But 
I have desired, and have so expressed 
myself, that our children should be 
brought up to be a new generation, so 
to speak, that there will not be a tea 
drinker, a coffee drinker, a tobacco 
user, a liquor or beer drinker in the 
whole generation; that we may have 
a generation that can say "I never 
tasted tea and coffee, I never tasted 
tobacco, I never use any of these in- 
toxicants;" that a whole generation 
shall grow up in that way. It can 
be done through the agencies of the 
Sunday schools; for every child can 
be so taught. But if parents use 
these articles, the children can say, 
"Well, my parents grew up under 
different circumstances to those that 
surround me; but I am not going to 
taste these articles; I am not going to 



IOO 



/ > ESKRE T SI NDA Y SCHOOL UNION 



acquire the least desire for them, and 
know anything about their influence 
upon my body." 

I have taken the liberty of urging 
this course upon the children, and have 
said If you will do this you will have 
satisfaction during your life, and we 
will raise up a generation of this kind, 
very diefferent to the generation to 
whom the Word of Wisdom has been 
preached now for over sixty years. 
So much on that point. i 

I do not want to trespass upon your 
time; we have had so many meetings. 
But there is one point I would like 
to mention, and that is that the 
Mutual Improvement Associations 
should endeavor, we wish to say that 
to the brethren in charge, as much as 
possible, to refrain from taking the 
superintendents of the Sunday schools 
as missionaries, or to act in other 

capacities. 

My brethren and sisters, let us 
glorify God with all our hearts for 
what He is doing for our children. 1 
feel as though we were going to raise 
a mighty generation. Every heart 
should be encouraged for that which 
God has done and is doing for us. The 
future before us is of the grandest de- 
scription. If we will open our eyes 
to see and look with the eye of faith, 
we will see how rapidly God is ful- 
filling His promises, and how glorious 
is the prospect of the fulfillment, the 
future fulfillment of those that are 
yet unfulfilled. God bless you all, in 
the name of Jesus. Amen. 

FIRST ASSISTANT SUPERINTEND- 
ENT GEORGE GODDARD 
said. I thank my Heavenly Father for 
what my eyes have seen and what my 
hands have received from Thy servants 
and Thine hand-maidens. I ask Thee to 
accept my thanks and gratitude, in the 
name of Jesus Christ. Amen. 



PRESIDENT JOSEPH F. SMITH: 

I feel also very grateful for the 
recognition that has been given me this 
evening by President Cannon and this 
body of teachers of Sunday schools, and 
I hope to be able to labor in connection 
with my brethren in the Sunday school 
cause, as I always have done, and 
more faithfully, if possible, in the 
future, and as opportunity may pre- 
sent. I have always had a lively in- 
interest in the youth of Zion and in the 
children of Zion, and I have always 
felt that nothing I could do would be 
too much, if it could be directed in 
the interset and welfare of the children 
of the people of God. I feel very grate- 
ful for the recognition and of the calling 
to which I have been called this even- 
ing. I feel very grateful to the brethren 
in my spirit for the kindness and for 
the high appreciation which they have 
manifested toward Brother George 
Goddard for his faithful and efficient 
labors in the Sunday school cause. I 
feel that they have done honor to 
themselves in thus recognizing the 
faithful and valient services of this our 
veteran brother in this cause. And may 
God bless Brother Goddard and con- 
tinue his health and strength many 
years to come, that he may pursue his 
labors as heretofore in the interest of 
the young people of Zion. May the 
Lord bless those who contributed this 
beautiful medal and purse of money 
for his benefit, and I feel that the 
Lord will bless them therefor. Amen.
